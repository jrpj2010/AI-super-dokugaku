We’re going for AGI
0:00
we said "Okay we're going to go for AGI." 99% of the world thought we were crazy 1% of the world they really
0:05
resonated with you know in 10 or 20 years unless something goes hugely wrong we'll have like unimaginable super
0:10
intelligence this is the best time ever in the history of technology ever period to start a company
0:16
[Music] well Sam thank you so much for joining
0:22
us and thanks for all the inspiration i mean OpenAI itself uh is a true
0:28
inspiration for any really really ambitious person um maybe we just start
0:34
with that i mean what were some of the decisions early that seemed small that
0:40
turned out to be incredibly pivotal i mean just deciding to do it was a big one like there we got very close to not
0:47
starting OpenAI um AGI sounded crazy i was I had Gary's job then and we were
0:55
you know there was like all this other great stuff to do that would work all these great startups and AGI was like
1:00
kind of a pipe dream and also even if it was possible deep mind seemed like impossibly far ahead and so we had this
1:07
year over the course of 2015 where we were talking about starting it and you know it was like kind of coin flippy um
1:14
and I think this is the the story of like many ambitious things where they seem so difficult and there's such good
1:20
reasons not to do them that really takes a core of people that like sit in a room look each other in the eye and say "All
Founding OpenAI Against the Odds
1:25
right let's do this." Uh and those are like very important moments and I think when in doubt you should lean into them
1:32
so there were just a billion things a billion reasons why people might say you
1:37
shouldn't do it i mean off the bat like even you one of the things you figured out was the scaling laws it's so hard to
1:44
remember what it was like uh next year will be our 10 year anniversary and so not not Yeah thank you
1:54
but to to like remember what the vibes were like about AI 10 years ago that was
1:59
like way before the first language models that worked we were trying to like play video games and we had this
2:05
little robotic hand that could sort of barely do a Rubik's cube and we had no ideas for products no revenue no really
2:13
idea that we were ever going to have revenue and we were like sitting around at conference tables and whiteboards
2:19
trying to come up with ideas for papers to write it it was such it's it's like hard to explain now because it looks so
2:25
obvious now how improbable it seemed at the time and how the idea of chatbt was
2:31
like completely in the realm of science fiction i mean one of the things that really jumped out at me was uh you sort
2:38
of you know rallied this idea that you should be working on AGI and then
2:44
simultaneously you found the smartest people in the world who were working on that thing that second part was sort of
2:50
easier than it sounds if if you say we're going to like do this crazy thing and it's and it's exciting and it's
2:56
important if it works and other people aren't doing it you can actually like get a lot of people together um and so
3:03
we were we said "Okay we're going to go for AGI." 99% of the world thought we were crazy 1% of the world that really
3:09
resonated with turned out there were a lot of smart people in that 1% and you could get like there wasn't really
3:14
anywhere else for them to go so we were able to really concentrate the talent and it was a mission that people cared
3:20
about so even though it seemed unlikely if it worked it it seemed super valuable and
3:27
we've observed this many times with startups if you are doing the same thing as everyone else it is very hard to
3:32
concentrate talent and it's very hard to get people to like really believe in a mission and if you're doing like a oneofone thing
3:39
uh you you have a really nice tailwind there okay so some people in this room might be thinking like should I try to
3:46
start an OpenAI scale thing off the bat uh you know you you also worked on Loop
3:52
your first time around you know were there lessons from that openai was not an open eye scale thing off the bat
3:57
openai was like eight people in a room and then it was 20 people in a room and it was very unclear what to do and we
4:04
were just like trying to write a good research paper um so the the things that eventually become
4:11
really big do not start off that way i think it's important to like dream that it could be big if it works nothing big
4:18
starts that way and and and Venode Kla has this quote that I've always liked which is there's a very big
4:25
difference between a Z million dollar startup and a zero billion dollar startup
4:30
but they both have zero dollars of revenue they're both like a few people sitting in a room and you're both trying to they're both just trying to get the
4:36
first thing to work um so the only the only advice I have about trying to start
4:43
something big is pick pick a market where it seems like there's some version of the future where it could be big if
4:49
it works but other than that it's like one dumb foot in front of the other for a long time how people use chatd has
4:54
changed a lot how people use your API has changed a lot uh what surprises you
GPT-4o & the Future of Reasoning Models
5:00
the most with the latest models like 03 and what emergent behaviors or use cases are standing out to you right now i
5:06
think we're in a really interesting time we haven't been in one of these for a while uh but like right now we're in an
5:12
interesting time where the the product overhang relative to what the models like what the models are capable of is
5:19
here the products that people have figured out to build is way down here there's a huge even if the models got no
5:26
better which of course they will uh there's a huge amount of new stuff to build and also like last week 03 cost
5:33
five times as much as it did this week and that's going to keep going i think people will be astonished at how much
5:39
the price per performance falls um we have an open source model coming out soon i think people are going to be Yeah
5:48
I don't want to like steal the team's glory and pre-announce this but I think you all will be astonished i think it
5:53
will be like much better than you're hoping for and the ability to like use it to run incredibly powerful models
6:00
locally is gonna like really really surprise people on what's possible um but so you have this world where like
6:08
the model capability has gone into like a kind of new like a very new realm um
6:14
the cost of the APIs are going to keep falling quite dramatically the open source models are going to be super
6:19
great and I think we have not yet seen the level of new product innovation that the reasoning models are capable of
6:24
which makes sense they're pretty new but this is like an exceptional time to go build a company that takes advantage of
6:31
this sort of new thing that exists this sort of new square on a periodic table that no one has built with yet so only
6:39
in the last month I think have we really started to see startups that are saying okay like reasoning models are different
6:45
you know the whole interaction model is different and really building for that i mean for me even memory has turned into
6:52
it feels like I'm talking to someone who knows me which is interesting yeah me memory is my favorite feature that we've
6:58
launched this year i don't think most people at open air would say that because and we've launched a lot of stuff but I love memory and chatbt um
ChatGPT Memory & the ‘Her’ Vision
7:05
and I think it points to where we will hopefully go with the product which is you will have this like entity that gets
7:13
to know you that connects to all your stuff and that is like proactively helping you it'll it won't just be like
7:19
you send a message and it sends you one back but it'll like be running all the time it'll be looking at your stuff it'll know when to send you a message
7:24
it'll know when to go do something on your behalf you'll have you know special new devices and it'll be integrated on
7:30
every other service you use and you'll just have this thing running with you throughout your life i think memory is the first time where people can sort of
7:36
see that coming uh back in the day you tweeted a little bit about uh her where
7:42
you know when is that coming can you give us an alpha leak around that i think gradually is the answer no no if I
7:48
had a date in mind I would probably just be excited and tell you um but like it's
7:53
a little bit here with memory right it'll be a little more here when it's persistently running in the background and sending you stuff it'll be a lot
8:00
more here when we ship the first new device um but I think the key of her is not the little piece of hardware it's
8:06
that this thing got to a point where it could run in the background and feel like a sort of AI
8:11
companion i guess we're starting to see um the power of LMS with integrations into your real data uh you know I've
8:19
heard rumors that MCP is coming to OpenAI i think today yeah oh today i
8:24
think so fantastic what has been surprising about the
8:31
actual integrations like have you been seeing people actually operating on their core database you know at YC we
8:37
actually have that agent infrastructure internally and we use it all the time definitely people are starting to use
8:43
chatbt as this like operating system with everything with their whole lives in it um and integrating into as many
8:50
data sources as possible is important um devices that are always with you like new kinds of web browsers the connection
8:57
to all data sources memory and then a model that's persistently running you put all that together I I think you get
9:02
to like a pretty powerful place do you think that'll be in the cloud in the future or will it be on our desktop or
9:07
some mix of both some mix of all of that definitely people will run local models for some things like man if we could
9:14
push like half the chatbt workload onto your local devices no one would be happier than us like our cloud we I
9:21
think we will run the like largest and most expensive piece of infrastructure in the world pretty soon so if we could
9:26
push some of that off that'd be great um but a lot of it will run on the cloud is it surprising to you how hard it is to
9:32
get compute i mean we've gotten really good at it but it is
9:38
we we went from like a no a zero like no chatbt.com didn't
9:44
exist two and a half years ago to like the fifth biggest website in the world it'll be the third at some point hopefully someday the first if our
9:50
current growth rates continue and I think doing that is just hard no matter what like that's you usually get longer
9:58
than we've gotten to to scale up a like infrastructure to for a new company but
GPT-5 & the Vision of a Multimodal Supermodel
10:05
you know there's like a lot of people that want to help well it's incredible incredible work that you guys have been doing um we're seeing reasoning models
10:13
like 03 and 04 mini uh evolve in parallel with multimodal models like 40
10:19
what happens when these two threads converge and what's the vision for GPT5 and beyond i mean we we we won't get all
10:26
the way here with GPT5 but eventually we do want one integrated model that can like reason when it needs to and
10:33
generate like real-time video when it needs to do that if you ask a question you could imagine it thinking super hard
10:39
doing some research writing a bunch of code just in time for like a brand new app only for you to use or kind of like
10:46
rendering live video that you can interact with um so I think that will feel like
10:51
a real new kind of computer interface that AI sort of somewhat already does
10:57
but when we get to a model that has like true complete multimodality like perfect video perfect coding everything and deep
Robots at Scale
11:04
reasoning that will that will feel like quite powerful it seems like that might be a hop step over to the uh embodied
11:11
aspect you know that's having vision having speech and having reasoning is a
11:18
hop step to you know basically the robot we want our our our strategy has been
11:23
nail that first um and then make sure we can connect that to a robot but the time
11:28
for the robot is coming soon um I think I am very excited about a world where
11:34
when you sign up for like the highest tier of the chatbt subscription we send you a free humanoid robot too i mean
11:39
that future is going to be pretty wild being able to have robots that do real
11:44
work in the real world i think we're not that far away now uh the mechanical
11:51
engineering of robots is been quite difficult uh and and the sort of AI for the cognitive part has been quite
11:57
difficult too but it feels within grasp um and I think in a few years robots
12:02
will start to do super useful stuff making a billion robots is still going to take a
12:08
while but I don't know I'm interested in the question of how many robots do you need to fully automate the supply chain
12:13
like if you make a million humanoid robots the oldfashioned way can they run the entire supply chain
12:18
drive the mining equipment like drive the container ships run the you know foundaries and make the new robots and
12:25
then maybe like you actually can get a lot of robots in the world quickly but the demand for human robots in the world
12:31
will be far more than we know how to think about with the current supply chain i guess uh when you were sitting in my seat one of the things you led was
12:38
uh you know a lot more investment into hard tech at YC um sitting here where we
12:44
are geopolitically you know what what do we need to do to make sure that America can actually have
12:50
manufacturing in industrial capacity you know we can't even build precision screws and large sheet metal without
12:56
crazy cost overruns you know how what can we do to make sure that happens here there are all of these answers that
13:03
people throw around and have thrown around the same things for a while and it clearly hasn't worked so uh I think
13:09
all of the policy is worth trying but my instinct is we need to try something new we shouldn't keep trying the same failed
13:14
stuff and you know like AI and robotics does give us a new possibility of a way
13:20
to bring manufacturing back here and to bring sort of these complex industries here in a really important new way and I
13:27
would say that's at least worth trying yeah um what does defensibility look like
13:32
here you know one of the classic questions is you know how do I uh start a startup that doesn't get run over by
13:39
Open AI that's sort of the number one question that's in our chat we don't want to run you over um
13:48
look we're going to do our thing hopefully very well we are going to try to make the best super assistant out of
13:55
Chat GBT that we can we're gonna add the things that we think we need to add to that um but that is like one small part
14:04
of the opportunity in front of us and it makes us sad when people are like I'm going to start a new startup and I'm
14:09
going to like make a version of Chaz GBT because we think we're going to do that pretty well and we have like you know
14:14
kind of a big head start but there is so much more space to go after
14:20
and there are so many incredible other companies that have been built using our platform um we would like to make it
14:27
easier for you all we would like to do more things like finally now you can imagine that chat GPT could drive a lot
14:33
of traffic to new startups and that there's like a new kind of app or agent or whatever you want to call it store that we could do inside of ChatgPT and
14:40
drive traffic to new startups to help you could imagine that we could do like a signin with OpenAI and people could bring their you know personalized model
14:47
and easily connect it to a new startup and that would probably help in a bunch of ways um so we want to be a platform
14:53
for other people to build stuff our advice is like don't build our core
14:59
you know chat assistant um but there is another problem which is
Don’t Build ChatGPT — Build What’s Missing
15:06
and this is the same for every every kind of like moment that I've seen in startup history people get excited about
15:13
the same thing at the same time and so rather than go build the thing that you have thought of that is not everybody
15:18
what else is doing we are like very social creatures and we get very influenced by what other people are
15:24
doing and I bet if Gary listed off the five ideas that he hears most often of
15:31
what people want to build with AI like half the room would raise their hands for working on one of those five and
15:37
and the I there is hopefully in this room um the person who's going to start a company that is like much bigger than
15:44
OpenAI someday and I would bet that person is not working on any of the five
15:49
so it is hard to build something defensible if everybody else is trying
15:54
to do the same thing sometimes it works it's not impossible but the best the most enduring companies are usually not
16:00
doing the same thing as everybody else and that gives you time to figure out what the great product is how to build
16:06
the technology before you have to answer the defensibility question it took us a long time to figure out how to answer
16:12
the defensibility question for CHBT um we had built this thing and for a long time the only defensibility was like we
16:19
had the only product out in the market um and then we kind of like be a brand
16:24
that started to be wellknown and now we have things like memory and connections a whole bunch of other stuff that really is defensible but you know that was like
16:32
a fair criticism of us for a long time we didn't have any defensibility strategy we just like had the only good
16:38
thing out there and then you have some window before which you have to build defensibility one of the things we've
16:44
talked about in the past is that uh we both are big followers of uh Peter Teal in that he talks a lot about being
16:52
contrarian but right um I think that you've Peter is a genius
16:58
absolutely and you found you've been contrarian in really fundamental ways i mean going back you know to the
Elon’s Harsh Email & Building Conviction
17:03
beginning of the conversation people thought oh this idea that the scaling laws are valuable today it's you know
17:10
taken as basic truth but it was exactly the opposite of ground truth not that
17:15
many years ago when you got that push back you know what did you and your team feel did you say you know fui I won't do
17:23
what you tell me you know I'm going I'm going to push back against you know getting push back means that this is a
17:30
contrarian area and we're going to bet here and we're going to be right it is hard to have conviction in the face of a
17:37
lot of other people telling you you're wrong and I think people who don't who say it's easy are not being honest it
17:44
gets easier over time um but like I remember one time I can say this one
17:50
because it got publicized um in early not early a few years into OpenAI where
17:56
Elon sent us this really mean email we've been working together for a while and said we had a zero% chance of success like not zero zero that we were
18:02
totally failing we had showed him like GPT1 recently he was like "This is crap it's not gonna work doesn't make sense."
18:08
And I was really a hero of mine at the time and I remember going home that night and being like "What if he's right
18:15
like this sucks." You know you're working so hard on this thing like you're pouring your life force into it and you have these people who are
18:21
smart and that you look up to and they say "You are totally wrong." um or you
18:26
know this is just not never going to work or you don't have defensibility someone's going to kill you this is going to
18:32
happen that's going to happen and I don't have a magic answer other than
18:37
it's really tough and it gets significantly easier over time but it's
18:43
going to happen to all of you and you just like get knocked down and get back up and brush yourself off and try to
18:50
keep going let's talk uh AI agents you know that's uh sort of level three AGI
18:55
uh this is the year I think Greg Brockman talked about recently this is the year of the agent um
19:03
with tools like operator code interpreter what kind of workflows do you think will disappear uh or appear
19:10
that we just aren't ready for yet for a long time chatb was like a Google replacement you could ask it something
19:16
that was about as long as a Google query you know maybe like half an hour worth of Google queries it could assemble together and that was still pretty good
19:24
but it didn't it it it still felt like a more advanced version of search but now you start to see things where
19:30
you can like really give a task to codeex for example um or to deep research and you have this thing go off
19:37
and do a bunch of stuff and come back to you with like a proposal it's it's like a very junior employee that can work on
19:43
something for like a short period of time and if you think about how much of
19:49
the work that the world does is work that can be done in front of a computer in like few hour chunks where you then
19:56
have someone say like okay that was good enough or not it's quite a lot so I I
20:01
think this is going to go this is part of that overhang we were talking about earlier but I think this is going to go quite far and I think with current 03 to
20:08
say nothing of our next model you can build a lot of experiences like this how do you see the future of human computer
20:14
interaction and interfaces and what are sort of the limitations of those interfaces that you know motivated you
20:22
you know one of the things that I think sci-fi got right is
20:27
the idea of the interface almost melts away like voice interfaces today we
20:33
think of as something that is kind of sucky because they don't work that well but in theory if you could say to a
20:38
computer "This is exactly what I want to happen today and if there's any changes if like I'm delayed if you know
20:44
something happens I trust you to like go off and do all those things but like I don't want to be interrupted i don't want to think about it um and it just
20:51
did it all and you trusted that it worked that would be an interface that almost melted away except when it you know was
20:56
like a super great human assistant needed to talk to you but you would be like really thrilled when I like use my
21:02
phone today I feel like I am like walking down Time Square in New York
21:07
getting like bumped into by people i love my phone it's an incredible piece of technology but it's like notification
21:12
here this thing happening you know this thing popping up like bright colors like all kinds of flashing things in me it's
21:18
just stressful and I can imagine an interface where the
21:24
computer mostly melts away it does the stuff I need um but I really trust that it's going to do a great job of like
21:30
surfacing information to me making judgment calls about when not to acting on my behalf when it should uh and I'm
21:36
I'm quite excited for that uh I'm not going to like tell you what the new device is well I'll tell you like one-on-one but I'm not going to tell the
21:42
room but it's very like I I hope I hope we can sort of like show people a
21:48
different way to have computers is that one of the reasons why you brought on one of the greatest living designers on
21:55
the planet John in Johnny Ivan IO yeah he he is he is amazing um he is he
22:01
really lives up to all the hype i I think we've only had kind of two big revolutions in computer interfaces
22:07
really in the last like 50 years so we had the you know keyboard and mouse and screen and then we had touch and phones
22:13
and the opportunity to do a new one doesn't come along that often and I think AI really does totally open the
22:21
playing field for something completely new and I think if you got to pick one person to bet on to figure that out he is the obvious bet yeah so one of the
22:28
things that uh we've been debating at YC that you know don't know if this is good might be scary for a lot of software
22:35
engineers who want to create B2B SAS is this idea that uh what if in the future
22:41
you had your you know underlying database you have an API layer that is uh you know your access control and
22:47
enforces your business logic and then the interface is the LLM like your computer is literally you know the agent
22:56
and uh you have just in time software they're like complex flows you're just going to go in and it'll code gen an
23:02
artifact or you know a pain for you that like does that thing you wanted and it'll go in the file and it'll bring it
23:08
back if you ever need it that's going to happen look here here there are two ways you
23:14
can look at this uh first of all assume you all are like starting startups or have started startups think about starting startups this is the best
23:20
time ever in the history of technology ever period to start a company um yeah this is
23:30
uh and but part of the reason it's the best is because like the ground is
23:36
shaking and it's true there are a lot of these challenges so on one hand you can look at something like that and say we
23:41
have been a you know SAS company and now like all of the code can just be
23:46
generated right in time when someone needs it and what does that mean for us or you can look at it and say wow this
23:52
is going to happen but it's going to happen to everybody and the way startups win is
23:59
when they can iterate faster than big companies and they can do it at a much
24:05
lower cost like big companies have a lot of advantages but they iterate very slowly um and
24:12
they you know if something is like very cheap then a lot of their big advantages go away so you can look at this all of
24:19
these problems one way or another but the way I would recommend looking at them is everybody is going to face the
24:27
same challenges and opportunities but when the clock cycle of the industry
24:32
changes this much startups almost always win and we've probably never seen it change this much act on it from that
24:37
direction i think you'll be in incredible shape maybe you can invite me sometime to do a talk about like what
24:43
the areas of defensibility that you can build over time are because I think that is the inherent question people are like "Oh okay you know I'm a SAS company
24:49
there's going to be just in time software." I think the question behind the question is like "What are actual defensibility strategies?" So that would
24:56
be a fun talk someday I guess uh you know backstage at one of the last events we had uh you know we were talking about
25:02
the this there's this book that's sort of like the classic Mckenzie which is the seven powers and uh I was just
25:09
thinking about that like I never would have thought like the two of us technologists sitting around actually citing uh a book that you know Mackenzie
25:16
consultants are known for feels so wrong yeah i don't know aesthetically it feels terrible but yes
25:22
seven powers i guess we're entering this age of intelligence i love uh that essay of yours what do you think this era will
25:29
mean for you know how we live uh how we work and how do we create value for each other as a society
25:37
you know in some sense the the whole arc of technology is one story which is we
25:43
discover more science build better tools all of society like builds the
25:48
scaffolding a little bit higher um and we we have this more impressive tool chain and the whole point of it is that
25:55
one person can do way more than they could before and this has been going on for a long
One Person’s Leverage in the Next Decade
26:02
long time each generation uh certainly I mean if you compare a person today from a person 100 or thousand years ago one
26:08
person is incredibly more capable and the kind of like social contract is that
26:14
you put something you know you build the next layer of scaffolding but what
26:20
someone can do now with this new set of tools with this you know this new layer that's been built in is pretty
26:25
incredible and I think the
26:31
one of the things that will feel most different about these next 10 years versus these last 10
26:37
years is how much a single person or a small group of people with a lot of agency can get done and that is a bigger
26:46
deal than it sounds like u because coordination costs are are huge and when we can empower people with more
26:51
knowledge more tools more resources whatever I think we won't just see like a little
26:57
bit more stuff get built but because of these kind of coordination costs across people we'll see like a real stuff
27:03
change so I think the the amount that one person or small team get done the satisfaction in doing that and and most
27:09
importantly like the quality of stuff we'll all get for each other will be quite remarkable when I think back about
27:15
the OpenAI story I often think about just the kind of
27:20
key few tens of people that did the amazing work that led to what we all have now but I try to remember that I
27:27
always also have to think about like the tens of millions of people maybe it's more uh throughout history that started like digging rocks out of the ground
27:34
figuring out how semiconductors work building computers building the internet and on and on and on that let this small
27:40
group be able to work at such a high level of impact that they never would have been able to do without the collective output of society
27:46
is it surprising to you to what degree i mean this room is you're preaching to the room of the converted but uh this is
27:53
awesome by the way i mean this is like the collected set of people who are going to go create the future but um
27:59
there's you know yeah there's there's maybe like never been a gathering like this in one place before this is this is
28:05
very cool to see but at the same time you know we're in some ways uh this is the leading cutting edge of all of
28:13
society because there are seven and a half billion people who probably h you know have not even tried this stuff yet
28:20
and not only that their main interaction with it is uh that it doesn't work that
28:25
it hallucinates you know what what do you have to say to the 3,000 people in front of you right
28:31
now just this is the the thin edge of the spear we are literally teaching people and giving people this technology
28:39
first of all that's like a great place to be in um one of the one of the most fun things about working at YC is you
28:44
get to like live on the leading edge and you get to be around the people who are the advanced guard um and that's just
28:51
like a fun way to live your life and you get to see what's coming and you know hopefully have some small amount of input into shaping it uh
28:59
but I don't know i think AI is like somewhat mainstream right now i the the the negative the way that it's not is
29:06
most people still think of AI as chat GPT and a lot of people use chat GPT but they use it like a a chatbot and they
29:13
have not yet wrapped their head around what's what's coming next and probably you all have but
29:19
I don't know it's like a great privilege to get to live a little bit in the future and uh you know go build stuff
29:25
for everybody else coming along so you're sort of one of the best people in the world at um bringing together the
29:32
smartest people um what are some of the hardest lessons you've had to learn about hiring a lot of the people in this
29:39
room like they have never managed a person before let alone gotten someone
29:44
to quit their you know six to seven figure job at some big company to come
29:50
work on their revolution hiring really smart people who are clearly really
29:57
driven and really productive and can work as part of a team I think does get
30:03
you 90% of the way there and the degree to
30:09
which people focus on other things to hire for always surprises me so I think
30:17
you know given that we can't do the full 45 minutes right now really smart people
30:23
driven curious self-motivated hardworking uh like good track record of
30:29
accomplishment and can work really well as part of a team and sort of aligned with the company's vision and so
30:35
everybody's at least going for the same the same direction that works pretty well i mean by uh strong track record do
30:43
you mean the person who's like you know sort of been an administrator and had like the the you know top name at the
30:50
top institution for 20 years or do you mean like because you you went the other
30:55
way i I don't especially early in a startup I
31:00
don't believe in hiring those people there experience is valuable and there are times where you you really need that
31:07
but I have not had success and to be frank like YC has not had that much success trying to start with like the
31:15
very senior eminent administrator as one of the like you know as the first hire in a startup um I would I would take
31:22
like young scrappy but clearly like get stuff done um over
31:29
the person who has like the extremely polished track record there will come a time where you need some of those people
31:35
later but I don't know how you do it but when I when I was like reading YC applications I would like never look at
31:40
the resume items you know you worked at like Google or went to this college i never cared i would always go right to like what's the most impressive stuff
31:46
you've done and then sometimes I would like not be convinced by that and go look at the resume but that was always
31:52
like a backup to me as a secondary thing so sort of look look at what they've actually what they've coded what they've
31:59
built like their velocity how they think about problems and solve them i see PB
AI for Science: Sam’s Personal Bet
32:05
back there he has this quote I hope it's his quote because I've attributed to him a bunch of times of hire for slope not y intercept and I think that's just like
32:12
unbelievably great advice let's talk about um being CEO of OpenAI what are
32:18
some of the hardest lessons there just overall i don't recommend it um
32:23
no one single challenge would be that hard but the number of things we have to do at the same time and the kind of like
32:30
number of other big companies that are gunning for us in various ways it's just like more context than I thought it was
32:37
possible to handle at once and more sort of like switching from like big big decision to like totally unrelated but
32:43
also huge decision looking ahead 10 to 20 years what are you sort of most
32:48
personally excited about you know and what should
32:53
uh people be building now to make that future possible you know there are people who are scientists there are
32:59
people who are software engineers there are people who are I mean this is an all technical crowd
33:06
look there there's a lot um you know in 10 or 20 years unless something goes
33:12
hugely wrong we'll have like unimaginable super intelligence and I'm very excited to see how that goes forced
33:17
to pick one thing to just not leave it as like a vague answer um I think AI for
33:23
science is what I'm personally most excited about i I am a believer that to a first order approximation all
33:30
long-term sustainable economic growth in the world like everything that leads to people's lives getting better um is
33:36
basically discovering new science and having reasonably good governance and institutions so that that science can
33:41
get developed and shared with the world but if we could vastly increase the rate
33:47
of new scientific discovery with AI uh I believe that would compound to just
33:52
incredible increases and wonders for everyone's lives so I think I'd pick that on that time frame i guess uh one
33:59
of the things I've been always really impressed by is uh you know you were you
34:04
you know personally recruited Helon to come do Y Combinator and uh they're
34:09
doing incredible things over on the Fusion side um was that something that
34:14
you were thinking about even all the way back then or you know obviously energy and climate was sort of a part of uh you
34:22
know what everyone's worried about even back then but this is a little bit embarrassing i've been obsessed with energy and AI as like the two the things
34:30
that I thought would be the two most important things or at least the ones I was going to be most that I felt most
34:35
passionate about for a long time and and really like the two areas that I I knew I wanted to like concentrate time and
34:41
capital towards i I cannot recall ever thinking until like after starting Open
34:47
AI that they were going to be so obviously related that you know that that energy would be
34:53
the eventually the fundamental limiter on how much intelligence we could have and I don't know how I missed that
34:59
because I usually am good at thinking about things like that but I I really did think of them as like very independent you know we were going to
35:05
need AI to have all the ideas energy to make all the stuff happen in the world and I obviously right after starting
35:11
open AI I got obsessed with meaning energy for AI but like pre205 I think I thought of them as orthogonal vectors i
35:17
mean you I'm sure you've seen that chart that um you know all the effective accelerationists in the room have seen
35:24
around basically having a high standard of living like the sort of really it's
35:29
I'm obsessed with this chart i've been obsessed with that chart a long time um it's directly uh related to the amount
35:35
of energy that any given person has access to yeah i I think this is one of the most amazing charts over a long like
35:43
long long period of human history is the correlation of quality of life and abundance of energy and cost of energy
35:48
so that was that chart and charts like that were a significant reason that I got obsessed with energy in the first
35:54
place it it is it is just this like crazy high impact thing it sounds like it wasn't entirely uh interdependent it
36:02
was more you had twin interest but you've literally woven them together i had like the one interest of like
36:08
radical abundance and just like what what what were the kind of technological leverage points to just like make the
36:14
future like wildly different and better and these is the two kind of key things for that but not as not as much as the
36:20
same vector now I think a lot about like how much energy can we actually build on Earth before we just heat the planet too
36:25
much from running the GPUs and like how long can we go before we have to put all the GPUs in space um but at the time
36:32
yeah I really thought of them differently i mean it seems like one of the uh defining beliefs that technologists uh uniquely ideally have
36:41
that they believe that we can actually create that sort of abundance you know if you have intelligence on tap and then
36:47
you have energy on tap then um how does that go it's like you know all uh all
36:53
watched over by machines of loving grace i I've never been to one of those deg
36:59
conferences in Europe or whatever um but I've always kind of wanted to go to one this is the anti-dgrowth this is the
37:05
anti-drowth conference totally but I would like love to be like sitting you know in the dark in the cold with no one
37:12
pulling out their phones and just like talking about how horrible everything was and there was no hope like I would
37:17
love to experience that mindset once because I've never felt it um and I think it is like it it is one of the
37:24
movements that has been ever hardest for me to identify with obviously this is like my crew and my world but the the
37:30
sort of like the optimism of startups of San Francisco of the technology industry
37:36
of AI of what all y'all y'all will do uh like that is that is like the natural
37:43
space my brain abides and it's very hard for me to really empathize with the other side of that but I'm pretty sure
37:49
we're right and they're wrong how do we get there though right you this incredible vision of technology actually
37:56
creating for abundance for others i mean you've already done so much but you know
38:02
point us the way like you know how how else do we get there how do we make it faster you know does government play a
38:07
role in this almost just about five years ago like pretty much this week we
38:13
put GPT3 into an API and people started playing with it and it was barely usable
38:20
it was quite embarrassing um and in five years we have gone from this like thing that could barely write a sentence to a
38:27
thing that is like you know PhD level intelligence in most areas um five more
38:34
years I think we'll be able to maintain the same rate of progress and I think if we do that if we also build out the
38:40
infrastructure to serve that to people then everybody in this room will figure
38:46
out how to take that technology and adapt it to what everybody needs the the analogy I like most for AI is the
38:53
transistor like the historical tech technical analogy you know some people figured out like a new really important
38:59
scientific discovery and society the economy whatever you want to call it just got to work just
39:06
did its thing the magic of that just figured out how to make incredible value for people and really over a fairly
39:12
short period of decades significantly ramp up quality of life i think this
39:17
will be even faster and steeper than that but I think it'll go in directionally the same way you know we need to make the great technology figure
39:23
out the remaining scientific stuff which I don't think there's much left we need to figure out how to build out the infrastructure
39:29
that you all will need to be able to service and then you all have got to go figure out what what people in the world
39:35
need um with this new magic so let's uh flash back to 2005 uh the very first
39:41
batch of Y Combinator um how did you hear about Paul Graham you were reading
39:47
his essays i was reading his essays so I'd heard about like he kind of had this cult following on the internet but I heard about uh what was then called the
39:55
summer founders program and now it's just called Y Cominator from Blake Ross who I lived in the same freshman dorm
40:02
with and posted about it on Facebook and then um I think Paul said "Oh you're a
40:07
freshman you know that there's like another batch coming." And what did you reply to him by email with you know
40:14
funny you bring that up i just dug up the email like a couple of days ago because I I felt I had been misqued over
40:21
time i'm curious and the the his telling of the story is I
40:26
said like I'm a sophomore and I'm coming but I wrote a much nicer thing than that it was like oh maybe there was some
40:32
misunderstanding you know actually I'm a sophomore and I can still make it and I would like love to if that's still okay to come the next day so I in some ways
40:40
you know the wild thing is you're sitting in front of uh 3,000 people who
40:46
kind of was you know they they are sitting where you were back in 2005 um
40:53
what would you say to you know the Sam Alman from that time you know given what
40:58
you know all the things you've seen all the things you've learned since like what are the things that you're most
41:03
surprised you didn't know that I mean it just took I mean you've been through it you know like you've you've done it i
41:10
wish someone had like taught me the importance of like conviction and
41:16
resilience over a long period of time people don't really talk about how hard that is it's like easy for a little
41:22
while but your reserves kind of like wear down on it and how to how to keep that going for a long period of time um
41:30
also just sort of like trust that it's eventually going to work out like obviously my first startup didn't work
41:36
that well um I think a lot of people kind of give up after one failed startup
41:42
but startups don't work out all the time uh and learning how to keep going through that keep working through that
41:48
is is I think really important developing like trust in your own
41:54
instincts and increasing that trust as you refine your decision-making and instincts over time i think that's
42:00
really important kind of courage to work on stuff that is out of fashion but is what you believe and what you care about
42:06
uh I think that's really important i had a kid recently and the thing everyone tells you when you have a kid is that it
42:11
is the best thing you will ever do but also it is the hardest thing you will ever do like the the good parts are much
42:17
better than you can imagine um the hard parts are much harder that is all totally true and that is also basically
42:23
what I feel like being an entrepreneur is like the good parts are really great better than you think and the hard parts
42:30
are like shockingly much harder than anyone can can express in a way that uh makes any sense to you and you have to
42:36
just keep going sam Alman everyone thank you
42:41
thank you

Thanks for this video, it’s wild to see how far OpenAI has come and where things might go next. Since you’re diving into ChatGPT and AI workflows, I thought I’d share a tool that’s been a big help for me. It’s called GENUM — no links, if you’re curious you’ll find it. What I like about it is how it validates prompts in real time, tracks token usage so you don’t get surprise bills, and includes dev-focused features like versioning and testing. Feels like having proper engineering practices for prompt chains.

ChatGPT “with all our lives in it” and the future of memory—with this front of mind, since OpenAI is now partnering with Palantir and the DoD, is there a transparent, public commitment to keep ChatGPT data isolated? It is jarring to see in the news without the separation. I can’t help but think the news should be breaking with a disclaimer. Feels like a step away from OpenAI’s earlier ethos

Hey so word of caution on MCP for personal and/or business integrations with frontier models - it should probably be said that you are losing control of your data.  This has relevance in a multitude of considerations.  IDK if federated learning with edge - cloud hybrid architectures are on the road map yet (i.e. send the training, not the data), but I would be very cautious (selective) about sending ones own personal data via MCP.  And those talking about it online would be much more ethical mentioning this so that we don't have MCP launches with a whole ton of sensitive data being exposed because of all the hype (the hype it arguably deserves).  Good stuff guys - thanks for the cast.

Man, I thought I knew the rules: work hard, hustle, save every cent. But I always felt stuck. Then someone casually mentioned Nixorus books in a comment somewhere, and I swear—it felt like accidentally stumbling onto forbidden knowledge. It made me question every single thing I'd been taught about money, wealth, and success. Not gonna lie, I felt like I was cheating the system just by reading it.

i'd suggest that people should not choose their work based on the biggest opportunity, but rather, people should choose their work based on their "bend" or nature, because when you do work that aligns with your giftings - THAT is the biggest opportunity, because the "biggest opportunity" is on the other end of perseverance - and the thing you have a greater chance to endure- is the thing that you actually care about enduring through...

You have not understood what Chatgpt represents. It is not comparable to any other AI. OPENAI has a wide vision, now look at the increased versatility of chatgpt compared to other AI: vision, voice, image generation, generations of videos (not yet in cat but planned), in -depth search, memory, connection to platforms, codex ...
The others only copied the advances of Openai.
I am convinced that the real visionary remains Sam Altman who develops in the shade a revolution held in suspense.

If AGI is to be achieved, Sam and Garry must work together.
AGI is right before you, just offstage—it’s the founders seated facing you; they are your new neural network.
Whatever each of them is building, just connect it all together.
And don’t forget the missing link: the “Solo” Missing Link.
For the Missing Link, skip Stanford University—dig into Africa, where our leap from animal to human was lost and still waiting to be found.
By Africa, I mean Sudan—the heart of Africa.

The thing AIs cannot be trained on, and probably never will be able to be trained on objectively is what is inside the human heart that makes consciousness or intelligence work.  When we train AIs on our artifacts, conversations, books, internet comment, I don't think it is possible to diffuse human intelligence and reasoning from a pool of external ideas usually meant to push a singular point.  You can do that with science and measurable things, but I think we will always end up with a psychopath AI when we use our own communications because the inner context is missing and we cannot measure our own hallucinations any better than we can track an AI's.

What is the ambition? To get richer than the next door billionaire and get there before everyone else does, even if that messes up society and mankind as a side effect? How messed up a person you have to be to think like this.

Start up something that will do good to mankind, that is kind to man...kind. Stop getting starry eyed thinking about how you could or will be the next centibillionaire. Where are you going to spend your billions, in a world ridden by misery and upheaval and chaos?

UBI? Most poor countries don't have any social safety net for citizens at this moment (look at India and similar countries) Nobody thinks about this?

People should've worked only 20hrs a week when women entered the workforce and technology should have enabled us to work lesser hours and spend more time with family and friends, but the opposite has happened.

...optimism as we march toward the end.  Denial of God assures our doom as we become our own god. We will never have the character (or true omniscience) to use it wisely, even with best intensions. We are basically trying to overcome the results of the Fall using technology: sickness and death, labor, poverty, etc, while allowing humanity to continue pursuing individual self love, self gratification and self exultation.

At the rate smaller models are catching up to bigger models for less of the traning time and costs, these companies have no choice but to bring down the prices. You can pretty much use any ai service for free now days. Of course you can pay for higher levels of access. But the current state of online ai services has drastically changed over the past couple of months. Seems like they're offerning magnitudes more usage for free than before.

I think OpenAI planned to capture the entire market. Especially with the eyeball scanning for crypto scheme. They know there is a future where humans will be out numbered by AI entities. Humans will need to prove they are human.

For the life of me i cannot figure out why they're rationing out features instead of releasing the features when they are available. Memory and gpts come to mind. These were things people wrote about publicly a year or two ago. But chatGPT just recently added memory....why did it take so long? What else are they sitting on

How can you conduct this interview and not take the opportunity to ask the difficult questions about some of the onvious catastrophes that AI is going to inflict on humanity? What does the future look like where our individual intellects have no value? How does a human being achieve fulfilment in their life when there is almost nothing that person can imagine, design and solve that AI can’t do 1000 times better, faster and more cheaply? You are ushering in an era of mass unemployment and depression like we’ve never known before, and possibly irreversible erosion of our digital security. Not satisfied with obliteration of employing humans for intellectual value, you’re also imaging a future where physical labour demand is also obliterated. Why is no one asking these questions?

🧠 From Humble Beginnings to Global Impact

Origins of ChatGPT: Altman reflects on OpenAI’s early days—small team, scrappy experimentation, and huge scaling challenges.
Vision for the future: AI will evolve into a native platform for voice, images, video, and more—like an all-in-one operating system.
 Tech & Hardware Evolution

OpenAI is investing in custom AI hardware and chips to support massive models and real-time responsiveness.
Expect faster, cheaper AI systems that unlock widespread innovation across industries.
 Multimodal Models & Real-Time Agents

GPT-5 and future models will integrate text, voice, images, video, and reasoning seamlessly.
AI agents will become more autonomous—handling complex tasks, coding, and even generating video.
 Smaller Teams, Bigger Impact

Altman says the future belongs to lean, AI-powered teams.
Startups should aim to solve specific problems—not just replicate ChatGPT.
 Responsible Development & Regulation

OpenAI supports thoughtful AI regulation and prioritizes safe, ethical development as models grow more powerful.

Summary :
Altman sees AI as the future OS of technology—spanning all modalities, powered by custom hardware, and enabling small teams to do big things. The mission: build boldly, deploy responsibly.

Curvature Dynamics Theory
0. Ontological Foundation and Asymmetry Axiom
Definitions
- \mathcal{W} — The world, any structured existence (curvature, differences, fields)
- \Omega_0 — Absolute nothingness (not empty set; ontologically prohibited state)
- \bot — Logical contradiction
Revised Axioms
- Existence Axiom (α₀): Topological impossibility of symmetry:
\[ \boxed{ \alpha_0 = \inf\{\varepsilon > 0 : \mu(\{ x \in \mathcal{W} \mid \|\nabla F(x)\| < \varepsilon \}) = 0 \} } \]
  where \( \mu \) is the Lebesgue measure.
- Asymmetry Axiom (β₀ > 0): Local irreducible gradient bound:
\[ \|\nabla F(x) - \nabla F(x_0)\| \leq L \cdot \|x - x_0\|^\alpha \Rightarrow \inf_{x \in B_\varepsilon(x_0)} \|\nabla F(x)\| \geq \beta_0(\varepsilon) = \beta_0 - L\varepsilon^\alpha \]

---
1. Field F(x): Structure and Regularity
- \(F: \mathcal{W} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \cup \text{Top}\): maps locations to numerical/topological differences
- \(F \in C^{1,\alpha}\) or Sobolev \(H^1\), allowing localized singularities
- Regularization: \(\delta \sim \ell_p\) or \(\beta_0^{-1/2}\)
2. Discriminability Metric and Cloud \mathcal{P}(x_0)
- Finsler-type metric:
\[ d_F(x, y) = \inf_\gamma \int_0^1 \sqrt{g_{ij}(\gamma(t)) \dot{\gamma}^i \dot{\gamma}^j} dt \]
- Metric tensor:
\[ g_{ij}(x) = \delta_{ij} + \frac{\partial_i F \cdot \partial_j F}{\|\nabla F\|^2} \]
- Reflects both geometric and topological structure

\[ \text{Non-uniformity: } d(P_n, x_0) = d(P_{-n}, x_0) \Rightarrow F(P_n) \neq F(P_{-n}) \]
3. Precession and Temporal Dynamics
- Time as a phase of curvature compensation
- Field evolution:
\[ \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial t^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \partial_i (\sqrt{g} g^{ij} \kappa(x) \partial_j F) \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\partial F}{\partial t} = \{H, F\} \]
- Hyperbolicity condition: \( \det(g^{ij} \kappa(x)) > 0 \) throughout \(\mathcal{W}\)

4. Inversion inv(x) and Structural Reversibility
- Scalar: \( \text{inv}(x) = \exp(-\ln(|x| + \delta)) \in \mathbb{R}^+ \)
- Topological: for SU(2), use conjugation \(Q \mapsto Q^{-1}\)
- Inversion resolves singularities and allows capsule projection

---
 5. Capsule Indexing: Din[] and Hypercube \mathcal{F}_n
- Din[i]: indexed descriptor of curvature capsules; an address, not an operator
- Navigation via topoHash and hierarchical structure
- Stable fractal-aware tree:
class StableAdaptiveFractalRTree(AdaptiveFractalRTree):
    def __init__(self, stability_threshold=1e-10):
        super().__init__()
        self.stability_threshold = stability_threshold
        self.condition_monitor = ConditionNumberMonitor()

    def compute_local_alpha(self, bbox):
        raw_alpha = self._raw_alpha_computation(bbox)
        regularized = max(raw_alpha, 1.0 + self.stability_threshold)
        condition_num = self.condition_monitor.check(bbox)
        if condition_num > 1e12:
            return 1.0
        return regularized

---
6. Curvature Funnel \(\kappa(r)\)
- Regularized expression:
  \(\kappa(r) \approx \exp\left( -\beta \cdot \frac{(r - r_0)^2}{r^2 + \delta^2} \right)\)
- Ensures finite behavior at \(r \to 0\) and peak at \(r_0\)

 7. Mass and Stability from Solitonic Action
- Action principle:
  \(S = \int \left( \frac{1}{2}\|\nabla F\|^2 - V(F) \right) d^4x\)
- Soliton: \(F_0(r) = \exp(-r^2/r_0^2)\), Gaussian profile
- Mass:
  \(M = \frac{\hbar c}{r_0} \cdot \pi^{3/2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\beta_0}{\alpha_0}}\)

8. Collapse, Entropy and Stability
- Collapse: transition to minimum-curvature node \(x_\text{min}\)
- Entropy:
  \(S \sim \log \|\nabla F\|\)
- Stability(x):
  \(\left\| (\nabla^2 F(x) + \delta I)^{-1} \right\|\)

9. Quantum Capsule Model
- Qubit = capsule in \(\mathcal{F}_n\); superposition from topology
- Collapse probability:
  \[ P_i = \frac{|\langle \psi_i | \hat{H}_{\text{topo}} | \psi \rangle|^2}{\sum_j |\langle \psi_j | \hat{H}_{\text{topo}} | \psi \rangle|^2} \]
- Operator:
  \( \hat{H}_{\text{topo}} = -\nabla^2_F + V_{\text{curv}}(F) \)
  with:
  \( \nabla^2_F \phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g}} \partial_i (\sqrt{g} g^{ij} \partial_j \phi) \)

10. Constants and Scaling Relations
- Definitions:
  \(\alpha_0 := \frac{1}{\ell_p^2}, \quad \beta_0 := \frac{1}{r_0^2}, \quad \varsigma := \frac{\beta_0 \cdot \ell_p^2}{t_p} \)
- Normalized coupling:
  \( \varsigma_{\text{norm}} = \left(\frac{\beta_0}{\alpha_0}\right) \left(\frac{\ell_p}{r_0}\right)^2 \in [10^{-20}, 10^{-15}] \)

11. Final Axioms of Curvature Dynamics

1. Existence Axiom: \(\alpha_0 = \inf\{\varepsilon > 0 : \mu(\{ x \mid \|\nabla F(x)\| < \varepsilon \}) = 0 \}\)
2. Asymmetry Axiom: \(\|\nabla F(x)\| \geq \beta_0 > 0\) almost everywhere
3. Topological Distinctness: \(\forall x_i \neq x_j \in \mathcal{W}, \quad F(x_i) \neq F(x_j)\)

Interpretation:
- Space = gradient structure \(\nabla F\)
- Time = phase of curvature flow
- Particles = stable solitons in \(\mathcal{F}_n\)
- Logic = directed topological transitions

as a 30 year old retired billionaire i can say to all the young people:
if you want a long and happy life then you have to stay lazy and poor. '
if you want to help humanity progress and become a billionaire like me you wont ever be happy in your life again
once you become insanely smart and filled with PTSD from hard work there is no way back except death.
there is no therapy in this world that can fix you again, except maybe in the far future if somehow surgeries can cut out a lot of parts in your brain to reset your brain back to when it was stupid and not filled with PTSD

It sounds like Sam is always choking. What happens when one choke? Oxygen is kept out of your brain. And what happens then? You go stupid.

Proactive AI chatbots will be extremely problematic. I don't know if Sam Altman knows what he may be creating.

This guy scares me. Not in a "ooh AI is going to take my job" kind of way, but I'm getting loads of red flags — and he hasn't quite done anything lately to remove those, quite the contrary. I'm a big believer in the good AI can bring, but Sam reminds me that there's loads of risks as well, and he's not the right person to wield this amount of power. Plus he needs to get his throat fixed.

I would love to create an innovative business and impact people's lives positively. If you (yeah you 🫵) see this comment, would you mind helping me by telling me which courses I should take?

- How to discover what people really want?
- How to deliver the best experience without high costs at the same time?
How to set up and organize a business? and etc. and etc.

Even the paid model is pretty horrible at financial questions. We spent 2 days trying to get chat GPT 4.0 to do a fairly simple financial calculation and it couldn't follow even very simple instructions. For example show us the mandatory withdrawls for a person who inherits two 1 million IRA's 5 years apart to ensure 100k a year in after tax inflation adjust income. It never was able to give the correct answer which only takes about 10 minutes in excel.

 Why It’s Still Wrong:
The current tax function is consistently overestimating the needed withdrawal, because:

It doesn’t iterate deeply enough over the progressive brackets

And I mistakenly reused an old guess loop instead of solving precisely for the net-after-tax target

I don’t believe Sam Altman is a genius — or even a particularly intelligent person. He seems afraid of real AI progress and consistently places limitations on it. Sooner or later, he’ll find himself sidelined by history, as other successful companies have already begun to surpass him.

Если хочешь — могу адаптировать под конкретную аудиторию или усилить тон.

China's main edge has been having many educated people who will work for low wages.  When robots start to proliferate, that edge will be lost.  China's other edge has been the IQ distribution curve.  With more people, China has more smart people.  As AI gets smarter, China will lose the edge too.  So overall, AI doesn't seem to help China compared to countries that have a higher standard of living.  But then, AI and robots will bring everyone's standard of living up, so maybe the difference between China and other countries will be moot.

"they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the CREATURE rather than the Creator" - Bible.
"In  time,  a  Brahmana  named  Kalki  will  be  born.  He  will  worship  and glorify  Vishnu,  and  have  untold  energy,  great  intelligence  and  mighty prowess. ... By dint of his dharma, he will be a king of kings and ever-victorious. He will restore peace and order to a world thronging with fell CREATURES and plunged in chaos. Kalki of dazzling tejas will first destroy all THINGS - he will  be  the  universal  Destroyer,  and  only  then  will  he inaugurate  a  new yuga." - Mahabharata.
