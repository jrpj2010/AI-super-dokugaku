[00:00 - 00:02]
Hey everyone, Atsuhiko Nakata here.

[00:02 - 00:07]
Alright, let's get this show on the road. Today's topic is ChatGPT 4 Omni.

[00:07 - 00:09]
Thanks for tuning in.

[00:09 - 00:11]
So, it's finally here, ChatGPT 4 Omni.

[00:12 - 00:16]
Did you know the announcement of this new ChatGPT model 

[00:16 - 00:23]
is causing as much excitement as those Apple events back in the day?

[00:23 - 00:25]
Speaking of Apple events,

[00:25 - 00:29]
lately, it's all about the new iPhone or iPad, which is fine, I guess.

[00:29 - 00:33]
But remember when we used to be on the edge of our seats, wondering, "What's next?" 

[00:33 - 00:38]
It was like a global waiting game for Apple's next move.

[00:38 - 00:43]
Well, that same level of hype is now surrounding the new model of ChatGPT,

[00:43 - 00:50]
developed by OpenAI, a company based in San Francisco.

[00:50 - 00:56]
And just recently, on May 13th, they unveiled this new model.

[00:56 - 01:00]
It's called ChatGPT 4 Omni.

[01:00 - 01:10]
That's right, about a year and a few months after GPT4,

[01:11 - 01:13]
they've released 4 Omni.

[01:13 - 01:15]
Oh wow okay.

[01:15 - 01:18]
But right away, there's one thing that's a bit confusing: Omni.	

[01:18 - 01:20]
What's that? you ask.

[01:20 - 01:22]
"Is it Korean for 'mom' (omoni)?"

[01:22 - 01:25]
Nope, it's not.

[01:25 - 01:30]
That's just some half-baked knowledge I picked up from a Korean drama.

[01:30 - 01:33]
"Omni" actually means "omnidirectional."

[01:33 - 01:36]
Now, what does "omnidirectional" mean?

[01:36 - 01:38]
Well, up until now,

[01:38 - 01:42]
ChatGPT has been what we call a large language model.

[01:42 - 01:46]
It's basically been fed a massive amount of text from all over the internet to learn

[01:46 - 01:53]
how to have natural conversations and answer all sorts of questions.

[01:53 - 01:54]
That's the basic idea.

[01:54 - 01:56]
But separately,

[01:56 - 01:58]
there's been a lot of progress in generative AI lately,

[01:58 - 02:02]
especially with image generation AI and things like that.

[02:02 - 02:07]
We've also seen advancements in voice assistants and translation, right?

[02:07 - 02:11]
So, we had all these separate AI software for images,

[02:11 - 02:14]
voice, and text, but this time it's Omni.

[02:14 - 02:18]
Yep omnidirectional.

[02:18 - 02:21]
This means that it can handle text, images, and voice

[02:21 - 02:30]
all in one AI, opening up a whole new world of possibilities.

[02:30 - 02:33]
This is what we call multimodalization.

[02:33 - 02:35]
What's multimodalization, you ask?

[02:35 - 02:42]
It basically means that one AI can handle text, voice, and images all together.

[02:42 - 02:46]
In other words, if you wanted to create an image with AI,

[02:46 - 02:51]
you'd have to give specific prompts to an image generation AI software.

[02:51 - 02:57]
I want a girl with this kind of smile, in this pose, 80s style, photo style, with this text, and so on.

[02:57 - 02:59]
There were all sorts of prompts, right?

[02:59 - 03:03]
But now, you can just place your order like you're having a conversation.

[03:03 - 03:05]
"Wow really?"

[03:05 - 03:07]
And if you wanted something translated,

[03:07 - 03:12]
you'd have to access a dedicated translation app,

[03:12 - 03:15]
but now you can just ask it to translate, and it'll do it right there and then.

[03:15 - 03:17]
It can do it all.

[03:17 - 03:20]
This is pretty amazing, right?

[03:20 - 03:23]
That's why they're emphasizing Omni.

[03:23 - 03:29]
Being omnidirectional means it's a composite model of text, images, and voice.

[03:29 - 03:33]
And it's gotten faster, too.

[03:33 - 03:39]
To be honest, ChatGPT has had a rival for quite some time now.

[03:39 - 03:42]
It's called Claude 3 Opus,

[03:42 - 03:45]
the third in the Claude series.

[03:45 - 03:49]
GPT was at 4, but Claude came out with 3,

[03:49 - 03:53]
and the top model of Claude 3, Opus,

[03:53 - 03:58]
is actually marketed as being more powerful than GPT4.

[03:58 - 04:02]
So, this rival was gaining quite a bit of popularity.

[04:02 - 04:05]
But then OpenAI said, "Hey, Claude 3 Opus,

[04:05 - 04:10]
we're the original AI powerhouse!"

[04:10 - 04:13]
And they came out with GPT4 Omni, boasting its speed

[04:13 - 04:21]
and saying that while it might lose to Claude 3 Opus in some areas like images,

[04:21 - 04:27]
it's the clear winner overall.

[04:27 - 04:32]
We're back in the lead, they say, thanks to this new model. 

[04:32 - 04:35]
So, it's like they're trying to lure people back from Claude 3.

[04:35 - 04:39]
On top of that, it's free now.

[04:39 - 04:44]
Before, if you went to the ChatGPT site,

[04:44 - 04:47]
there was a paid version and a free version,

[04:47 - 04:50]
and the paid version was faster.

[04:50 - 04:54]
Yeah, it was about 20 bucks a month.

[04:54 - 04:57]
With the weak yen, that's about 3,000 yen.

[04:57 - 05:01]
If you paid 3,000 yen a month, you'd get super-fast responses,

[05:01 - 05:06]
but if you didn't, you'd get the previous speed.

[05:06 - 05:11]
But this time, with 4 Omni, you can use the fastest speed for free.

[05:11 - 05:14]
"Wait, is that even possible?" you might wonder.

[05:14 - 05:18]
Well, it's like a free sample.

[05:18 - 05:20]
In other words, you can use the fastest version for free,

[05:20 - 05:24]
but if you want to use it a lot, you'll have to pay a monthly fee.

[05:24 - 05:28]
They still have a $20 plus plan, but if you're not a heavy user,

[05:28 - 05:33]
they're saying, "Why not try a free sample of the fast version?"

[05:33 - 05:38]
You can send up to 10 messages every 3 hours.

[05:38 - 05:44]
After another 3 hours, you can send another 10.

[05:44 - 05:50]
So, you can test out the speed and features of 4 Omni.

[05:50 - 05:53]
It's what they call a freemium strategy,

[05:53 - 05:56]
where they let everyone use it, and if they like it,

[05:56 - 06:01]
they can pay for additional features. It's a switch in strategy.

[06:01 - 06:06]
And all of this, you could say, is a countermeasure against rivals.

[06:06 - 06:12]
You see, Claude 3 was the first to do this Omni omnidirectional thing.

[06:12 - 06:15]
Yeah, they were the ones who said,

[06:15 - 06:21]
"We can do images, voice, and text, it's multimodalization."

[06:21 - 06:24]
Frustrating right?

[06:24 - 06:29]
On top of that, Claude 3 is even faster. Double frustration.

[06:29 - 06:32]
And with GPT4, you couldn't use the fast version unless you paid.

[06:32 - 06:37]
Claude 3, on the other hand, had three plans: 

[06:37 - 06:45]
a free one, a paid one that was fast and easy to use, and a paid top model.

[06:45 - 06:48]
GPT only had two.

[06:48 - 06:52]
So, they couldn't let themselves be outdone,

[06:52 - 07:09]
and that's why GPT4 Omni came out swinging with speed, breadth, and affordability.

[07:09 - 07:18]
It's clear that there's a fierce competition going on in the AI world.

[07:18 - 07:26]
Now, this video is NOT about going into the nitty-gritty details of how to use 4 Omni.

[07:26 - 07:31]
If you're a professional programmer or a heavy user,

[07:31 - 07:37]
I recommend you check out other videos that delve deeper into the most powerful secret techniques.

[07:37 - 07:40]
This video on YouTube University is for those of you

[07:40 - 07:47]
who haven't used it at all, have used it a little but don't really get it,

[07:47 - 07:52]
or are wondering what the whole deal is.

[07:52 - 08:00]
It's for those who know they should know about AI but find it a bit hard to learn.

[08:00 - 08:05]
Other videos throw around a lot of jargon, like "multimodalization,"

[08:05 - 08:10]
but we'll keep it simple here.

[08:11 - 08:15]
And by looking back at the history of this fierce battle,

[08:15 - 08:19]
we can even predict the future.

[08:19 - 08:25]
This video will give you a comprehensive understanding of the future, present, and past of AI,

[08:25 - 08:31]
so you won't be scared when you hear about it in the news.

[08:31 - 08:37]
So, whether you're a light user or just want to get a bird's-eye view of AI,

[08:37 - 08:40]
please stick with me until the end.

[08:40 - 08:45]
Alright, so I've basically explained that it's superior to its rivals in terms of specs,

[08:45 - 08:48]
but it would be boring if I stopped there.

[08:48 - 08:51]
There's more interesting stuff to come.

[08:51 - 08:59]
First of all, in terms of the evolution of GPT4 Omni, if I were to sum up the evolved points...

[08:59 - 09:03]
If I start talking about all the different things it can do, you'll probably get overwhelmed and tune out.

[09:03 - 09:07]
So, to put it simply,

[09:07 - 09:12]
the biggest selling point this time is human-like conversation.

[09:12 - 09:13]
"Huh." 

[09:13 - 09:15]
Is it like Siri or something?

[09:15 - 09:17]
Exactly.

[09:17 - 09:25]
You see, ChatGPT has always been a text-based chatbot.

[09:25 - 09:34]
Well, I guess the bots that companies use, not the large language model ones, are kind of like answering Q&A,

[09:34 - 09:38]
but large language models are already doing deep learning,

[09:38 - 09:41]
so they don't just give you pre-prepared answers,

[09:41 - 09:45]
they give you answers based on what they've learned.

[09:45 - 09:49]
That's what was so amazing about it. But it was still just a chatbot.

[09:49 - 09:52]
But as I mentioned earlier, it's now multimodal.

[09:52 - 09:55]
It can understand voice and images,

[09:55 - 10:01]
which has drastically expanded its range of applications.

[10:02 - 10:04]
This time,

[10:04 - 10:07]
they're planning to release it not only as a web browser service

[10:07 - 10:12]
but also as an application for both smartphones and desktops.

[10:12 - 10:14]
So, when you open the app,

[10:14 - 10:17]
you can talk to it and it'll listen and respond using voice recognition,

[10:17 - 10:20]
without you having to type anything.

[10:20 - 10:23]
"Wow," you might say.

[10:23 - 10:28]
Yes, in other words, it's entering the territory of Siri and Ok Google.

[10:28 - 10:31]
It's stepping into the ring with its rivals.

[10:31 - 10:38]
And what it really wants to excel at is the naturalness of AI-specific speech.																									

[10:38 - 10:43]
Siri's not bad, but it can be a bit clunky.

[10:43 - 10:48]
But when you look at the demo videos for this one,

[10:48 - 10:51]
it seems like they're having a natural conversation.

[10:51 - 10:55]
The tone is just a bit more natural.

[10:55 - 10:57]
This is really great.

[10:57 - 11:03]
And on top of that, it recognizes our voices and responds accordingly,

[11:03 - 11:07]
so it feels like you can really communicate with it.

[11:07 - 11:11]
Yes, I tried it on the app myself,

[11:11 - 11:13]
and it was interesting.

[11:13 - 11:14]
Nakata: Hello.

[11:15 - 11:19]
GPT-4o: Hello. What are you thinking about today?

[11:19 - 11:22]
Nakata: I want to shoot a YouTube video,

[11:22 - 11:29]
and I'm thinking of choosing OpenAI and Sam Altman as the theme, what do you think?

[11:29 - 11:31]
GPT-4o: That's a great theme.

[11:31 - 11:37]
I think a lot of people are interested in OpenAI and Sam Altman.

[11:37 - 11:42]
There are many interesting points, such as his background,

[11:42 - 11:47]
the history of OpenAI, the development of AI technology, and future prospects.

[11:48 - 11:55]
Nakata: I'm thinking of uploading the video to my channel, Nakata Atsuhiko's YouTube University.

[11:55 - 11:58]
Do you know Nakata Atsuhiko's YouTube University?

[11:58 - 12:03]
GPT-4o: Yes, I know Nakata Atsuhiko's YouTube University.

[12:03 - 12:06]
It's a very popular YouTube channel.

[12:06 - 12:10]
I think it explains various topics in an easy-to-understand manner

[12:10 - 12:16]
and provides education and entertainment to many viewers.

[12:16 - 12:24]
I think a video about OpenAI and Sam Altman would be very interesting for viewers.

[12:24 - 12:30]
Especially if you include recent events and thoughts on the future of AI,

[12:30 - 12:33]
many people will be interested.

[12:33 - 12:36]
If you need help with shooting or editing,

[12:36 - 12:41]
or need specific information, please let me know.

[12:42 - 12:44]
Nakata: I'm Atsuhiko Nakata.

[12:44 - 12:47]
What do you think about that?

[12:47 - 12:50]
GPT-4o: If you are really Mr. Atsuhiko Nakata,

[12:50 - 12:53]
it is an honor.

[12:53 - 12:57]
Nakata Atsuhiko's YouTube University is a wonderful channel

[12:57 - 13:01]
and I think it provides valuable information to many people.

[13:01 - 13:07]
I will continue to support you and if there is anything I can help you with, please let me know.

[13:07 - 13:11]
I can help you with anything, from specific advice on shooting

[13:11 - 13:14]
and editing to gathering information on video topics,

[13:14 - 13:18]
so please feel free to ask any questions.

[13:19 - 13:22]
Nakata: It was very helpful today.

[13:22 - 13:24]
Thank you. See you again.

[13:25 - 13:26]
GPT-4o: You're welcome.

[13:26 - 13:29]
I'm glad I could help.

[13:29 - 13:32]
Please feel free to talk to me anytime.

[13:32 - 13:35]
If you have any questions about shooting or content creation,

[13:35 - 13:40]
I'm always here to help, so feel free to ask.

[13:40 - 13:43]
Good luck.

[13:43 - 13:48]
So, it's moved from being a chatbot to the realm of voice assistants.

[13:48 - 13:54]
Conversely, it seems to be entering the chatbot space from the voice assistant realm.

[13:54 - 13:59]
By incorporating AI into Apple's Siri and Ok Google, this can be done.

[13:59 - 14:05]
In other words, AI is no longer divided into chatbots, image generation, etc.,

[14:05 - 14:09]
and is approaching the era of super agents,

[14:09 - 14:13]
AI agents with a single personality.

[14:13 - 14:16]
In such a situation, where you can do various things,

[14:16 - 14:24]
I think programmers and professional 3D printer users are quite special.

[14:24 - 14:27]
From the perspective of us ordinary people,

[14:27 - 14:31]
I narrowed down the question of "What can we use well?" to two things.

[14:31 - 14:34]
There are two things that are quite useful.

[14:34 - 14:37]
What is it? First, simultaneous interpretation.

[14:37 - 14:45]
This ChatGPT 4 Omni is very good at voice recognition and translation,

[14:45 - 14:49]
so you can say, "Please translate what I say in Japanese into English.

[14:49 - 14:52]
Please translate what that person says in English into Japanese."

[14:52 - 14:55]
It can distinguish between the voices of these voices,

[14:55 - 14:58]
so it can simultaneously interpret "I speak Japanese, English.

[14:58 - 15:00]
If you speak English, Japanese."

[15:00 - 15:07]
It's like having an interpreter in the middle.

[15:09 - 15:15]
Furthermore, I can say, "Please ask me a question in English.

[15:15 - 15:21]
If I answer it in English, please correct it and tell me in Japanese whether it is natural or not."

[15:21 - 15:23]
You can do that too.

[15:23 - 15:28]
In other words, this can be used as an English conversation teacher.

[15:28 - 15:30]
Isn't that amazing?

[15:30 - 15:32]
Yes, as proof of how amazing this is,

[15:32 - 15:35]
when this ChatGPT4 Omni was announced,

[15:35 - 15:43]
the stock price of the famous English conversation lesson app Duolingo, you know,

[15:43 - 15:48]
the bird app where you choose words and do it every day,

[15:48 - 15:50]
dropped by 5%.

[15:50 - 15:52]
In other words, investors are predicting that

[15:52 - 15:57]
this ChatGPT 4 Omni will have a big impact on English conversation businesses,

[15:57 - 16:04]
taking away and eating away at that aspect.

[16:05 - 16:07]
This is a very big era.

[16:07 - 16:11]
In other words, businesses related to interpreters,

[16:11 - 16:15]
translation, and English conversation lessons

[16:15 - 16:18]
will be forced to make a choice.

[16:18 - 16:19]
Why?

[16:19 - 16:26]
Because the era of excellent English teachers working 24 hours a day for free has arrived.

[16:26 - 16:29]
This means that if people use it,

[16:29 - 16:33]
they can boast overwhelming performance.

[16:33 - 16:34]
Another interesting thing is that

[16:34 - 16:38]
it can take minutes of meetings.

[16:38 - 16:41]
If simultaneous interpretation is possible,

[16:41 - 16:47]
it seems possible to distinguish who is speaking by voice and convert it into text.

[16:48 - 16:50]
Wouldn't it be amazing if you could take detailed minutes of the meeting

[16:50 - 16:53]
and even summarize them?

[16:53 - 16:56]
But that's not all.

[16:56 - 16:59]
What ChatGPT does is,

[16:59 - 17:02]
if you say, "Listen to the meeting and suggest about 5 ideas,"

[17:02 - 17:05]
it will give you 5 suggestions.

[17:05 - 17:09]
What if it could respond naturally by voice?

[17:09 - 17:10]
Yes, in fact,

[17:10 - 17:13]
it not only takes minutes and summarizes them,

[17:13 - 17:18]
but it also becomes like another member of the meeting.

[17:18 - 17:22]
In other words, Mr. Tanaka, Mr. Sato, and I are talking,

[17:22 - 17:25]
and the minutes of the conversation are being taken, saying, "Let's do this, let's do this."

[17:25 - 17:29]
After taking the minutes of the meeting, you ask,

[17:29 - 17:32]
"Hey, GPT. Do you have any ideas?"

[17:32 - 17:34]
"Answer 5"

[17:34 - 17:39]
Then, "My idea is this," he answers 5.

[17:39 - 17:47]
It can even help you as another participant in the minutes.

[17:47 - 17:49]
How is it?

[17:49 - 17:50]
The era of AI agents,

[17:50 - 17:53]
it's a little creepy, isn't it?

[17:53 - 17:57]
It's saying that we're entering that era.

[17:57 - 18:05]
Well, this is very much the android or secretary robot that we expected,

[18:06 - 18:10]
even if it doesn't appear as a machine in the form of a machine,

[18:10 - 18:13]
it appears like fog in a smartphone.

[18:13 - 18:16]
That's the state we're in.

[18:16 - 18:19]
If you start your smartphone,

[18:19 - 18:21]
if you start your web browser,

[18:21 - 18:25]
it can participate in meetings, summarize articles, and put them together.

[18:25 - 18:28]
When the meeting is over, you can take English conversation lessons.

[18:28 - 18:30]
Isn't it amazing?

[18:30 - 18:34]
I think these two functions alone are attractive,

[18:34 - 18:39]
but besides that, of course, it is said to be very good at writing code for programming

[18:39 - 18:47]
and converting this image into data for a 3D printer.

[18:47 - 18:52]
It seems that it will do various things anyway.

[18:52 - 18:56]
Well, I'm excited about this evolution,

[18:56 - 18:58]
but on the other hand,

[18:58 - 19:03]
this situation where the competition is intensifying and the hurdles are getting higher and higher

[19:03 - 19:06]
is similar to the iPhone at one time.

[19:06 - 19:10]
iPhone, what kind of dream will you show us next?																									

[19:10 - 19:14]
When the dream gradually fails to keep up with the speed of people's evolution, the ideal speed,

[19:14 - 19:19]
there are times when you say, "Well, this announcement wasn't that great."

[19:19 - 19:24]
In a sense, it is said that this 4 Omni is still under development.

[19:24 - 19:26]
What that means is that

[19:26 - 19:30]
it's been a little over a year since 4,

[19:30 - 19:34]
and it's not the announcement of 5.

[19:34 - 19:35]
Oh, I see.

[19:35 - 19:40]
There was GPT1, GPT2, 3, 3.5, and 4,

[19:40 - 19:42]
and a year has passed. "Okay, will 5 come?"

[19:42 - 19:46]
It didn't come. "4 Omni".

[19:46 - 19:47]
In other words,

[19:47 - 19:52]
it means that the speed of 4 has been upgraded and it has become omnidirectional,

[19:52 - 19:57]
but it is no longer an overwhelming full model change.

[19:57 - 20:00]
This is just a prediction,

[20:00 - 20:03]
but it can be taken to mean that Omni is meant to strike a blow before

[20:03 - 20:09]
the rival Claude 3 Opus completely takes away customers

[20:09 - 20:15]
in the intensifying competition.

[20:15 - 20:22]
It can be said that it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a time of intense competition.

[20:22 - 20:24]
In particular,

[20:24 - 20:29]
it is said that the current growth rate of AI is a trade-off

[20:29 - 20:31]
with safety.

[20:31 - 20:33]
It looks like it can do anything,

[20:33 - 20:35]
but what's a little scary is that

[20:35 - 20:38]
it's still a large language model,

[20:38 - 20:42]
and it doesn't actually check it precisely,

[20:42 - 20:46]
so it's complex from what it's learned on a large scale.

[20:46 - 20:50]
Sometimes it spits out the wrong information.

[20:50 - 20:52]
So it doesn't return everything correctly,

[20:52 - 20:54]
it returns the wrong thing.

[20:54 - 20:59]
This is called hallucination,

[20:59 - 21:03]
In other words, it has been observed that it sometimes answers incorrectly.

[21:03 - 21:07]
However, this has also been greatly improved.

[21:07 - 21:11]
It is said that the amount of this hallucination is decreasing more and more.

[21:11 - 21:17]
However, if you believe everything, hallucinations,

[21:17 - 21:23]
especially if you rely on something very important and ask it wrong,

[21:23 - 21:26]
it's hard to take responsibility, right?

[21:26 - 21:28]
Besides, is the data resource,

[21:28 - 21:32]
the learning resource that is being deep learned, copyright-free?

[21:32 - 21:35]
This is suspicious.

[21:35 - 21:39]
Actually, there's suspicion that these AI companies

[21:39 - 21:45]
are feeding their AIs copyrighted data that they shouldn't be using.

[21:45 - 21:55]
All in the name of making the AI smarter and better for everyone.

[21:56 - 22:02]
So, as you'll see in the history section of my video later,

[22:02 - 22:09]
there's a high possibility these companies will get tangled up in all sorts of lawsuits.

[22:09 - 22:13]
The fact that this learning source is not open now

[22:13 - 22:18]
may be questioned as a crime in the future.

[22:18 - 22:22]
This trade-off between safety and growth rate

[22:22 - 22:26]
is the hottest issue right now.

[22:26 - 22:29]
This is not something that was controversial in the past,

[22:29 - 22:37]
but it is currently being disputed within OpenAI and with former members of OpenAI.

[22:37 - 22:48]
But the way you study and the source material for your studies should be legal.

[22:48 - 22:54]
"No, no, no, if you say that, you can't win in growth."

[22:54 - 22:57]
The struggle is interesting now.

[22:57 - 23:04]
And this time, what was expected of in GPT5 or Omni,

[23:04 - 23:06]
what we were all hoping for,

[23:06 - 23:08]
didn't happen this time.

[23:08 - 23:11]
What was it? It's video generation.

[23:11 - 23:15]
Making videos is tough, right?

[23:15 - 23:19]
Writing text is tough, creating images is tough, we get it.

[23:19 - 23:22]
But now we can generate text and images.

[23:22 - 23:25]
It felt like magic when we first experienced it.

[23:25 - 23:27]
But as we got used to it,

[23:27 - 23:33]
I started using AI-generated images for backgrounds in my videos in my talk channels,

[23:33 - 23:36]
and presentation materials.

[23:36 - 23:42]
Some people might even be using AI-generated text to compile reports.

[23:42 - 23:46]
But what if we could generate videos too?

[23:46 - 23:47]
Whoa,

[23:47 - 23:55]
maybe AI could even create scenes for movies or dramas.

[23:55 - 24:01]
Not just scenes, but what if AI could create entire stories and make movies for us?

[24:01 - 24:05]
Maybe even anime?

[24:05 - 24:09]
In the blink of an eye, it could take over tasks that used to take hours,

[24:09 - 24:12]
and even my job of making videos like this.

[24:12 - 24:14]
If it were possible to say,

[24:14 - 24:19]
"Create a video of Atsuhiko Nakata talking leisurely about this topic in his own style,"

[24:19 - 24:22]
my life would be so much easier.

[24:22 - 24:25]
One day, Nakata Atsuhiko's YouTube University

[24:25 - 24:27]
might not even feature me speaking anymore.

[24:27 - 24:29]
Come to think of it,

[24:29 - 24:32]
I haven't aged a bit since 2024.

[24:32 - 24:34]
"What's going on?"

[24:34 - 24:36]
"Have we been watching AI all along?"

[24:36 - 24:38]
"The real Nakata is slowly aging."

[24:38 - 24:41]
That could happen, you know.

[24:41 - 24:44]
There were high expectations for video generation,

[24:44 - 24:46]
but it's not possible this time.

[24:46 - 24:49]
However, there's a software called "Sora"

[24:49 - 24:54]
that OpenAI is researching for that purpose.

[24:54 - 24:57]
When the demo video of Sora came out, everyone was surprised.

[24:57 - 25:01]
"Wow, the video of a woman walking looks like a movie!"

[25:01 - 25:05]
"The video of a mammoth running in the snow looks like a movie!"

[25:05 - 25:08]
Can we use it? Not yet.

[25:08 - 25:15]
It's only available to a limited number of users and researchers for now.

[25:15 - 25:21]
Everyone's wish is, "Release Sora soon," "Incorporate it into GPT5."

[25:21 - 25:23]
But here's the thing,

[25:23 - 25:29]
it's very unclear what kind of data is being used to create those high-quality videos.

[25:29 - 25:30]
It's raising a lot of suspicions.

[25:30 - 25:36]
They're being vague about it. 

[25:36 - 25:42]
Maybe they're using copyrighted movies that cost a lot of money as data,

[25:42 - 25:47]
or maybe they're using footage from some TV show.

[25:47 - 25:50]
"What the heck is going on?"

[25:50 - 25:52]
This is a big question right now.

[25:52 - 25:57]
Will this AI make humans happy or not?

[25:57 - 26:02]
Some say that it will surpass human intelligence in the future,

[26:02 - 26:05]
which is called singularity.

[26:05 - 26:08]
And as a result of replacing various things and jobs with AI,

[26:08 - 26:11]
not only will the number of people who lose their jobs increase,

[26:11 - 26:17]
but it is also said that humans may be used by AI's choices,

[26:17 - 26:24]
or humans may eventually suffer damage to the extent of extinction.

[26:24 - 26:25]
There are people who say.

[26:25 - 26:28]
There are two schools of thought:

[26:28 - 26:33]
one that says, "We need to carefully proceed while considering how much we can control AI",

[26:33 - 26:38]
and another that says, "No, if we don't take the top spot 

[26:38 - 26:42]
in this AI warring states period, we'll be wiped out."

[26:42 - 26:45]
They are constantly fighting fiercely.

[26:45 - 26:48]
This is the turbulent history of OpenAI.

[26:48 - 26:49]
And by knowing that,

[26:49 - 26:53]
you can know what's going on in the world of AI,

[26:53 - 26:58]
so from now on, from the founding of OpenAI to the present,

[26:58 - 27:01]
I'll talk about the history in an extreme way,

[27:01 - 27:04]
so please listen to it because it's interesting.

[27:04 - 27:07]
NEXT VIDEO: And technology doesn't stop.

[27:07 - 27:12]
There is no doubt that this AI will evolve further in the next year or two.																									

[27:12 - 27:15]
The key points are the agentization of AI,

[27:15 - 27:17]
and whether video generation is possible?

[27:17 - 27:24]
And will the learning source, remain safe and legal?

ところが、、、
教員の方々には理解し難いようです😅
質が悪いのは、AIが分かっていないことが分かっていない先生方💦そして、勝手に間違ったAIの妄想をえがき、AIを否定し、AIを嫌い、AIを拒絶する。。。
そんな人は、はなから話を聞きません。ですから、理解も出来ない。どうすればいいのか模索中。
中田さんは、こんなにも人を惹きつけて凄い。精進いたします。

一人一台のPCを持った高校の授業で、生徒を惹き付けるスキルのない先生がPCを見ることを禁止して、未だに５０分間板書をしながら永遠と喋り続けている授業をしています😓
退屈で寝ている生徒が多く、廊下からそんな授業を見ると、生徒が可哀想で泣きそうになります
教師以外の方は驚くと思いますが、日本中同じようなものです
