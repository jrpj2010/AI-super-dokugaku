## Â≠óÂπï

[00:00 - 00:05]
I firmly believe that AI can potentially

[00:03 - 00:07]
double to triple every single one of my

[00:05 - 00:09]
companies per year. That's how big I

[00:07 - 00:11]
think it is. What would take someone in

[00:09 - 00:14]
2 weeks to put together everything you

[00:11 - 00:16]
need to really do a thorough job now

[00:14 - 00:19]
takes, you know, under an hour. This

[00:16 - 00:22]
right here was probably the replacement

[00:19 - 00:24]
of at least 3 months of work. You get

[00:22 - 00:26]
more done better and faster. Quality of

[00:24 - 00:29]
your work improves drastically. There

[00:26 - 00:32]
will be a democratization of execution.

[00:29 - 00:34]
You are wasting 80% of AI's potential

[00:32 - 00:36]
because you're starting every single

[00:34 - 00:38]
conversation from scratch. Meanwhile,

[00:36 - 00:41]
your competitors are getting strategic

[00:38 - 00:43]
insights from AI while you're stuck

[00:41 - 00:46]
explaining your business context over

[00:43 - 00:49]
and over and over again. Today, I'm

[00:46 - 00:51]
building a master prompt live. And

[00:49 - 00:56]
you'll see exactly why this completely

[00:51 - 00:56]
changes the game. Follow along with me.

[00:59 - 01:02]
Welcome back to the channel, Hayden.

[01:00 - 01:03]
Thanks for having me again, Thiago. So,

[01:02 - 01:05]
last time we introduced you to what the

[01:03 - 01:07]
master prompt is, what it's for, what

[01:05 - 01:10]
are some use cases. As we saw in the

[01:07 - 01:12]
comments, you wanted guidance in how to

[01:10 - 01:13]
actually create one for yourself. So,

[01:12 - 01:15]
that's what we're going to do now. We're

[01:13 - 01:17]
going to open up the template that we

[01:15 - 01:19]
shared with you previously, which we'll

[01:17 - 01:21]
share again in this video, and just walk

[01:19 - 01:24]
through answering and completing this

[01:21 - 01:27]
template step by step with the help of

[01:24 - 01:29]
both an AI itself, in this case, chatpt

[01:27 - 01:31]
for those of you who would like to use

[01:29 - 01:33]
chatpt instead of Claude, but also with

[01:31 - 01:35]
the help of Hayden here as my kind of

[01:33 - 01:37]
personal master prompt coach. For people

[01:35 - 01:39]
who are just joining us for the first

[01:37 - 01:41]
time, say a little bit about your

[01:39 - 01:43]
background in business. Sure. I've been

[01:41 - 01:44]
an entrepreneur all my life. Dropped out

[01:43 - 01:47]
of high school at 17 and started my

[01:44 - 01:49]
first company. I've bootstrapped

[01:47 - 01:51]
probably seven, eight figure companies.

[01:49 - 01:54]
Last decade I've spent buying businesses

[01:51 - 01:56]
and I've bought over 30 businesses that

[01:54 - 01:59]
collectively make 10 figures a year in

[01:56 - 02:00]
revenue. I'm currently on a path to

[01:59 - 02:02]
buying or investing in about 20

[02:00 - 02:04]
businesses a year. How does AI figure

[02:02 - 02:07]
into your business endeavors? I mean, AI

[02:04 - 02:08]
is just this massive transformational

[02:07 - 02:11]
project that applies to every single

[02:08 - 02:13]
business. So it's where I spend most of

[02:11 - 02:15]
my time and I'm now sort of developing a

[02:13 - 02:17]
pod of people and we kind of work with

[02:15 - 02:19]
AI and figure out how to innovate it

[02:17 - 02:21]
across all the businesses. And how do

[02:19 - 02:22]
you connect all that experience to the

[02:21 - 02:25]
master prompt? What does the master

[02:22 - 02:27]
prompt do that makes you interested in

[02:25 - 02:29]
teaching it? It is the second brain for

[02:27 - 02:31]
an organization. And so I'm very

[02:29 - 02:33]
interested in developing it out to

[02:31 - 02:35]
actually end up containing like all the

[02:33 - 02:38]
processes from within our business and

[02:35 - 02:40]
be able to automate many things, be able

[02:38 - 02:42]
to do automated reporting, really try to

[02:40 - 02:44]
remove all of the annoying repetitive

[02:42 - 02:46]
tasks that we have to do in business.

[02:44 - 02:47]
You're getting into some quite advanced

[02:46 - 02:49]
applications, but we're just getting

[02:47 - 02:52]
people started on just the V1 of their

[02:49 - 02:54]
master prompt, right? Which is, you

[02:52 - 02:57]
know, for me it was like a super it was

[02:54 - 03:00]
a aha moment. And even this V1 I I would

[02:57 - 03:03]
say is enough to make people probably at

[03:00 - 03:05]
least twice as productive, especially in

[03:03 - 03:06]
like a leadership role or in a strategy

[03:05 - 03:09]
role. If you want to see how this

[03:06 - 03:12]
applies to your specific business, we're

[03:09 - 03:14]
running a program where Hayden and I

[03:12 - 03:17]
work directly with business owners to

[03:14 - 03:19]
build their master prompt. And then not

[03:17 - 03:22]
just that, but to use that master prompt

[03:19 - 03:25]
to radically improve every single major

[03:22 - 03:26]
function within their organization. If

[03:25 - 03:29]
you're interested in joining the next

[03:26 - 03:30]
version of Second Brain Enterprise, I

[03:29 - 03:32]
encourage you to sign up to our wait

[03:30 - 03:34]
list. The first cohort, which we're

[03:32 - 03:36]
actually teaching right now, completely

[03:34 - 03:38]
sold out. So, don't wait to do that. And

[03:36 - 03:39]
if you watch till the end, we're

[03:38 - 03:42]
actually going to package together all

[03:39 - 03:45]
of this, the prompt, my insights,

[03:42 - 03:47]
Hayden's coaching, all together into a

[03:45 - 03:49]
free custom GPT that we'll share with

[03:47 - 03:51]
you that will guide you through the

[03:49 - 03:53]
process of creating this for yourself.

[03:51 - 03:55]
Ready? Let's get into it. So here's the

[03:53 - 03:56]
prompt I'm going to be using which don't

[03:55 - 04:00]
worry we will provide to you and it

[03:56 - 04:02]
basically tells chat GPT to act as a

[04:00 - 04:04]
business coach the foremost authority on

[04:02 - 04:06]
organizational design and strategic

[04:04 - 04:09]
planning and it's giving it a task which

[04:06 - 04:11]
is to help me understand and document my

[04:09 - 04:13]
professional context. Then we have more

[04:11 - 04:15]
specific instructions which are to

[04:13 - 04:17]
create a canvas that is the chat GPT

[04:15 - 04:19]
term for a standalone document which it

[04:17 - 04:21]
will call the master prompt and then to

[04:19 - 04:23]
ask me a series of penetrating questions

[04:21 - 04:26]
one at a time that's important to answer

[04:23 - 04:27]
the questions which are in our template

[04:26 - 04:29]
and then fill it out based on my

[04:27 - 04:30]
answers. I'm going to put my cursor at

[04:29 - 04:33]
the beginning, hold down the shift

[04:30 - 04:35]
button, go all the way to the end and

[04:33 - 04:38]
click again to select this whole thing.

[04:35 - 04:40]
Then I'll hit command C on the keyboard.

[04:38 - 04:43]
Head over to chat GPT. I like to use the

[04:40 - 04:45]
chat GPT desktop app. And then I'm going

[04:43 - 04:47]
to paste it in a new chat and hit

[04:45 - 04:49]
return. So this starts out with some

[04:47 - 04:51]
pretty basic questions. Pretty sure I

[04:49 - 04:54]
can answer these on my own, but let's

[04:51 - 04:56]
see. So there's my name. It wants to

[04:54 - 05:00]
know my role or title. I'm going to say

[04:56 - 05:02]
founder and CEO of Forte Labs. I already

[05:00 - 05:04]
said this, but I'll say Forte Labs. This

[05:02 - 05:06]
is the first question that I have some

[05:04 - 05:07]
doubts. So it's quite an open-ended

[05:06 - 05:09]
question. It's like how do you want to

[05:07 - 05:11]
use AI? My first instinct is like for

[05:09 - 05:13]
practically everything, how would you

[05:11 - 05:15]
make this this question kind of

[05:13 - 05:17]
manageable to answer? I would think

[05:15 - 05:19]
about probably two things. So I think

[05:17 - 05:21]
about what am I weak at? What do I not

[05:19 - 05:22]
enjoy doing? What do I want to automate?

[05:21 - 05:24]
Cuz AI can almost be looked at as

[05:22 - 05:26]
another form of delegation. Secondly, I

[05:24 - 05:28]
would look at where does AI provide the

[05:26 - 05:30]
most leverage for my business. Okay,

[05:28 - 05:33]
that is very helpful. So for the first

[05:30 - 05:36]
one, I'm going to say to help me think

[05:33 - 05:38]
through the strategic implications of my

[05:36 - 05:40]
decisions. I know in the past I've

[05:38 - 05:42]
sometimes made major business decisions

[05:40 - 05:43]
like pretty compulsively like just in

[05:42 - 05:45]
the moment. So I want to be a bit more

[05:43 - 05:47]
strategic. And then for the second one,

[05:45 - 05:51]
where can I leverage AI? I'm going to

[05:47 - 05:52]
say and to help me document processes in

[05:51 - 05:53]
my business cuz I don't really like

[05:52 - 05:55]
doing that and I think it's something

[05:53 - 05:57]
that it does well. So I'll just say

[05:55 - 05:59]
those two. Question five, what would you

[05:57 - 06:01]
consider your core professional

[05:59 - 06:03]
strengths? Skills, traits, or

[06:01 - 06:06]
capabilities that set you apart? My

[06:03 - 06:09]
initial thought is thoughtfulness,

[06:06 - 06:13]
thoroughess, love of learning, detail

[06:09 - 06:15]
orientation, curiosity, work ethic,

[06:13 - 06:16]
people skills. Is there any other way

[06:15 - 06:18]
that you would think in in terms of

[06:16 - 06:20]
strengths? Yeah, I always there's a

[06:18 - 06:22]
great question. It's like I think a

[06:20 - 06:24]
flywheel question by Jim Collins, which

[06:22 - 06:26]
is like where have you had success

[06:24 - 06:28]
professionally where other people have

[06:26 - 06:29]
failed? So, I I like that because I mean

[06:28 - 06:32]
this this list could potentially be very

[06:29 - 06:34]
long. I could say like I'm kind exactly

[06:32 - 06:37]
but you want to focus in on almost like

[06:34 - 06:39]
where I'm strong that others tend to not

[06:37 - 06:41]
be strong. So in that case I'm going to

[06:39 - 06:43]
say wow that's a very good question.

[06:41 - 06:45]
Just knowing you as a friend I would say

[06:43 - 06:47]
curiosity love of learning

[06:45 - 06:48]
thoughtfulness. The other ones are are

[06:47 - 06:50]
kind of more common in a way. There's a

[06:48 - 06:51]
lot of detail oriented thorough people

[06:50 - 06:53]
out there. Yeah. Almost another thing is

[06:51 - 06:55]
like if you if you randomly put you know

[06:53 - 06:57]
100 people in a room would you be in the

[06:55 - 06:58]
top five on those things? So you're

[06:57 - 07:00]
looking for skills where you are an

[06:58 - 07:02]
outlier. Yeah, you're uniquely good at

[07:00 - 07:03]
and I would say like top 5% or or

[07:02 - 07:07]
better. In that case, I wouldn't put

[07:03 - 07:08]
people skills. So, I'll just narrow it

[07:07 - 07:10]
down to those four. There we go. What

[07:08 - 07:12]
are your weaknesses? Is this just the

[07:10 - 07:14]
reverse of the previous one? Like where

[07:12 - 07:16]
are you unusually bad? Yeah. So, where

[07:14 - 07:18]
have you failed or struggled where other

[07:16 - 07:19]
people might have succeeded? And and

[07:18 - 07:21]
here I wouldn't say so last one we said

[07:19 - 07:23]
sort of top 5%. Here I wouldn't say

[07:21 - 07:26]
bottom 5% but I might say like

[07:23 - 07:27]
definitely bottom 30%. And obviously

[07:26 - 07:29]
this is in a professional setting like

[07:27 - 07:30]
I'm probably bottom 5% in sentence of

[07:29 - 07:32]
direction but that doesn't affect me in

[07:30 - 07:34]
my career. Okay. So business skills

[07:32 - 07:38]
where you're in the bottom third the

[07:34 - 07:40]
bottom 30 or so percent. Okay. There's a

[07:38 - 07:43]
streak of lack of practicality interest

[07:40 - 07:46]
in esoteric things. Yes it is a weakness

[07:43 - 07:48]
in building in building a business at

[07:46 - 07:50]
times. It's more of a a boredom or a

[07:48 - 07:52]
lack of interest in the non-eseteric. Oo

[07:50 - 07:54]
tendency to boredom is a big one. I'll

[07:52 - 07:56]
often ignore major problems in the

[07:54 - 07:57]
business or major opportunities because

[07:56 - 07:59]
I'm just like bored of them. I'd say

[07:57 - 08:03]
also, this is maybe related to that one,

[07:59 - 08:05]
resistance to doing anything I'm not

[08:03 - 08:07]
interested in,

[08:05 - 08:10]
which sometimes has been a weakness.

[08:07 - 08:11]
Love these easy questions.

[08:10 - 08:17]
This one I definitely know the answer.

[08:11 - 08:19]
April 2014. So, five full-time and a few

[08:17 - 08:24]
part-time

[08:19 - 08:28]
contractors doing things like design and

[08:24 - 08:30]
web maintenance. Who do you report to?

[08:28 - 08:34]
No one. Who reports to you is really

[08:30 - 08:35]
primarily Julia, our GM. This one, I

[08:34 - 08:36]
have a question. I don't know if it's

[08:35 - 08:37]
because we're an information product

[08:36 - 08:39]
business or because we're an online

[08:37 - 08:42]
business. I don't typically think about

[08:39 - 08:44]
markets, at least not geographic

[08:42 - 08:46]
markets. Would you define this by like a

[08:44 - 08:48]
like a demographic or psychographic or

[08:46 - 08:49]
something? I go into all of it. You do

[08:48 - 08:50]
sort of a geographic market primarily,

[08:49 - 08:52]
which is the languages that your

[08:50 - 08:54]
products are offered in. Huh. I guess

[08:52 - 08:55]
so. English speaking countries. Mainly

[08:54 - 08:57]
English speaking. And then outside of

[08:55 - 08:59]
that, you'd probably want to go into the

[08:57 - 09:01]
demographic. Yeah. I think I'd say

[08:59 - 09:02]
mid-career professionals and

[09:01 - 09:07]
entrepreneurs

[09:02 - 09:10]
in I'd say developed countries or urban

[09:07 - 09:11]
locations or large cities, although we

[09:10 - 09:13]
don't live in one. And then I'd add at

[09:11 - 09:14]
this point interests. Okay, that one I

[09:13 - 09:16]
can definitely say with interests in

[09:14 - 09:18]
productivity,

[09:16 - 09:23]
self-improvement,

[09:18 - 09:25]
learning, science, AI, and note-taking.

[09:23 - 09:26]
Do you think that's specific enough?

[09:25 - 09:27]
Yep. We'll get more specific in a

[09:26 - 09:29]
minute. We're just kind of looking for

[09:27 - 09:32]
like a first pass here. There we go. Who

[09:29 - 09:34]
is your ideal customer? If you've been

[09:32 - 09:36]
in business for a while, I would go

[09:34 - 09:37]
levels deep. So I would ask with my

[09:36 - 09:39]
previous customers if you don't already

[09:37 - 09:40]
know who your ideal customer is because

[09:39 - 09:44]
we have a very large market there. With

[09:40 - 09:45]
my previous customers who has had outsiz

[09:44 - 09:47]
success if I look at this from a

[09:45 - 09:48]
demographic perspective so for example

[09:47 - 09:50]
in one of my companies acquire we help

[09:48 - 09:53]
people buy businesses veterans do like

[09:50 - 09:54]
four times better than anyone else.

[09:53 - 09:58]
Interesting. And it's something to do

[09:54 - 09:59]
with their ability to persist in a

[09:58 - 10:01]
difficult process and their willingness

[09:59 - 10:03]
to adapt. So what is the equivalent

[10:01 - 10:05]
here? And outside of looking into like

[10:03 - 10:07]
who's had particular success, I'd also

[10:05 - 10:09]
see who like experiences the problem

[10:07 - 10:12]
most deeply, who has the active urgent

[10:09 - 10:14]
problem um of self-improvement and

[10:12 - 10:17]
note-taking that they're motivated to

[10:14 - 10:19]
move right now. And then finally, you

[10:17 - 10:20]
don't want to go too small such that the

[10:19 - 10:23]
size of the market is not large enough

[10:20 - 10:24]
for you to sustain yourself. Look at

[10:23 - 10:26]
what that size of the market is to

[10:24 - 10:27]
understand who tends to be most

[10:26 - 10:30]
successful and have the biggest outcomes

[10:27 - 10:31]
from what I do. The second one was who

[10:30 - 10:33]
experiences the problem most deeply? Oh

[10:31 - 10:35]
yeah, who experiences the problem most

[10:33 - 10:37]
deeply? And then I already forgot the

[10:35 - 10:38]
third as well. Uh size of market needs

[10:37 - 10:39]
to be large enough. I have a question

[10:38 - 10:41]
about that. What do you say to people

[10:39 - 10:44]
who and I've had this feeling in the

[10:41 - 10:45]
past who fear defining the customer so

[10:44 - 10:48]
narrowly that you miss out on

[10:45 - 10:51]
opportunities? You can expand that ideal

[10:48 - 10:54]
client over time. I would say that this

[10:51 - 10:56]
is the key to differentiation.

[10:54 - 10:58]
Differentiation is the key to high

[10:56 - 11:00]
margins. And high margins is the key to

[10:58 - 11:02]
profitability in a company. For example,

[11:00 - 11:05]
if you are a construction company that

[11:02 - 11:06]
constructs anything versus you're a

[11:05 - 11:08]
construction company that specializes in

[11:06 - 11:09]
data centers, the company that

[11:08 - 11:11]
specialize in data centers can charge

[11:09 - 11:13]
more because they specialize in data

[11:11 - 11:15]
centers. But they can also have lower

[11:13 - 11:16]
costs because they do the same thing

[11:15 - 11:19]
over and over again. Their process are

[11:16 - 11:21]
optimized for data centers. And so their

[11:19 - 11:23]
margin might be in a construction

[11:21 - 11:26]
company might be like 40 50%. Their

[11:23 - 11:28]
gross margin versus if they went and did

[11:26 - 11:30]
a hospital that they don't do or you

[11:28 - 11:32]
know a random warehouse their margins

[11:30 - 11:34]
might be half of that. It's about

[11:32 - 11:37]
zooming in and kind of specializing.

[11:34 - 11:40]
What comes to mind is a certain kind of

[11:37 - 11:42]
person who is kind of already highly

[11:40 - 11:46]
intelligent professionally

[11:42 - 11:48]
successful, and self-aware, but lacks

[11:46 - 11:50]
there's like an infrastructure layer

[11:48 - 11:55]
that they're missing. Lacks frameworks,

[11:50 - 11:58]
mental models, systems, and tools that

[11:55 - 12:01]
enable them to use their knowledge and

[11:58 - 12:03]
expertise effectively. Is that a good

[12:01 - 12:05]
ideal customer definition? I think it

[12:03 - 12:07]
could be honed. This would be difficult

[12:05 - 12:08]
for you to quantify the size of the

[12:07 - 12:11]
market. I would add one more thing which

[12:08 - 12:13]
is who has money, right? This is a

[12:11 - 12:15]
business ideally want to sell products

[12:13 - 12:16]
at good prices that they can afford. And

[12:15 - 12:18]
so that kind of goes with the the

[12:16 - 12:20]
problem, right? The person who

[12:18 - 12:21]
experiences the problem most deeply is

[12:20 - 12:23]
more most willing to spend money. So

[12:21 - 12:24]
I'll take a look at those that

[12:23 - 12:26]
description, right? Highly intelligent,

[12:24 - 12:29]
professionally successful, self-aware. I

[12:26 - 12:30]
see are they business owners? Are do

[12:29 - 12:32]
they hold a certain position in a

[12:30 - 12:35]
company? Are they managers? Are they

[12:32 - 12:37]
leaders? All of those examples are

[12:35 - 12:39]
people that have money to spend and also

[12:37 - 12:42]
people that probably see a little bit

[12:39 - 12:44]
more urgency or return on investing in,

[12:42 - 12:46]
you know, self-improvement. But you

[12:44 - 12:48]
could also go into other spaces where

[12:46 - 12:51]
it's not not even financially motivated.

[12:48 - 12:52]
Maybe it's more purpose oriented. Maybe

[12:51 - 12:54]
it's more like it will save lives if

[12:52 - 12:56]
they get better. That's also an active

[12:54 - 12:58]
urgency. So right now I would say Forte

[12:56 - 13:01]
Labs as a whole doesn't really

[12:58 - 13:04]
specialize on a specific customer. I

[13:01 - 13:07]
would say it's around your brand which

[13:04 - 13:10]
is highly thoughtful and esoteric and so

[13:07 - 13:12]
you are naturally attracting other

[13:10 - 13:14]
thoughtful esoteric people. However, you

[13:12 - 13:17]
could imagine a version of Forte Labs

[13:14 - 13:20]
that was designed for doctors or was

[13:17 - 13:21]
designed for CEOs or COOs, right? And

[13:20 - 13:24]
you could imagine that that version of

[13:21 - 13:26]
Forte Labs could probably charge 20x.

[13:24 - 13:28]
Yeah, I have seen evidence of that.

[13:26 - 13:29]
There's certain people that feel like,

[13:28 - 13:30]
you know, they say things like this

[13:29 - 13:33]
would have been a bargain at a hundred

[13:30 - 13:35]
times the price and other people, you

[13:33 - 13:36]
know, for the same product at the same

[13:35 - 13:39]
price that can't afford it. So there's

[13:36 - 13:41]
like this big variability around

[13:39 - 13:42]
whatever product we're offering. So

[13:41 - 13:45]
based on what you said, I have noticed

[13:42 - 13:47]
there's people who have stakes of some

[13:45 - 13:49]
kind who are therefore motivated to to

[13:47 - 13:51]
learn about, you know, these new systems

[13:49 - 13:53]
and frameworks are a big part of my my

[13:51 - 13:55]
customer base. I'd say leaders,

[13:53 - 13:57]
managers, professional creators,

[13:55 - 13:59]
entrepreneurs, executives. So, I think

[13:57 - 14:01]
I'll add that. So, it's almost like I'm

[13:59 - 14:03]
compiling a to-do list of things to look

[14:01 - 14:04]
into and research and think about just

[14:03 - 14:06]
from answering these questions. Yeah.

[14:04 - 14:07]
And all of this is part of strategic

[14:06 - 14:09]
planning in a business, which is not a

[14:07 - 14:11]
one-time thing, right? It's very very

[14:09 - 14:13]
iterative and you know, it should be

[14:11 - 14:15]
kicked off and reviewed quarterly in a

[14:13 - 14:17]
business at a minimum. Question 13. What

[14:15 - 14:19]
is the main outcome or transformation

[14:17 - 14:21]
that you deliver to your customers?

[14:19 - 14:23]
Would you do this on like a like an

[14:21 - 14:26]
emotional level or like things that are

[14:23 - 14:28]
measurable and tangible? Uh both. Yeah,

[14:26 - 14:31]
it depends on the business. So the the

[14:28 - 14:34]
emotions come to to mind first. things

[14:31 - 14:36]
like a sense of relief, hopefulness,

[14:34 - 14:41]
self-confidence,

[14:36 - 14:45]
ambition, as well as significantly more

[14:41 - 14:49]
organized productivity tasks, notes,

[14:45 - 14:53]
projects, goals, and a set of

[14:49 - 14:56]
technological tools that they understand

[14:53 - 14:58]
deeply and know how to use. How do you

[14:56 - 15:00]
how do you rate my response? I think

[14:58 - 15:02]
it's good. I would call it Yeah. sense

[15:00 - 15:05]
of relief from overwhelm and the

[15:02 - 15:07]
transformation is from hopelessness to

[15:05 - 15:09]
to hopefulness. How is your offering

[15:07 - 15:12]
different from your competitors? I'll

[15:09 - 15:16]
first write my gut instinct. Both my

[15:12 - 15:21]
content and my courses and books tend to

[15:16 - 15:24]
be deeper, more substantive, more

[15:21 - 15:29]
nuanced, better researched. I don't say

[15:24 - 15:33]
so myself. um more grounded in history,

[15:29 - 15:35]
science and psychology, more practical

[15:33 - 15:37]
and actionable. So typically when you

[15:35 - 15:38]
think of like an offer and you think

[15:37 - 15:40]
about differentiators in an offer, the

[15:38 - 15:41]
first thing you look at is the

[15:40 - 15:43]
likelihood of success higher than your

[15:41 - 15:45]
competitors. Are you competing under

[15:43 - 15:47]
that differentiation, right? If you come

[15:45 - 15:50]
with me, you are the most likely to

[15:47 - 15:53]
succeed in $100 million offers. Alex

[15:50 - 15:54]
Ramos uses this great example of you

[15:53 - 15:56]
want to lose weight, there's lots of

[15:54 - 15:57]
ways you can lose weight. probably the

[15:56 - 15:59]
most probable way to lose weight would

[15:57 - 16:01]
be you get a lipos section, right? It's

[15:59 - 16:04]
like you're 100% going to lose weight.

[16:01 - 16:06]
Yeah. Um but it's bad in other ways, but

[16:04 - 16:08]
because of that, you pay much more for a

[16:06 - 16:10]
liposuction than you do for, you know, a

[16:08 - 16:13]
personal trainer. So, first one is

[16:10 - 16:15]
higher outcome of success. Second is get

[16:13 - 16:18]
success faster than your competitors.

[16:15 - 16:19]
Third would be that it's easier for you.

[16:18 - 16:22]
You have to put in less effort. A fourth

[16:19 - 16:24]
would be that it's less risky or safer.

[16:22 - 16:26]
In your case, that probably doesn't

[16:24 - 16:29]
apply. So firstly I would say compete on

[16:26 - 16:31]
one of those. Later on you can compete

[16:29 - 16:33]
on multiple but ideally you compete on

[16:31 - 16:36]
one. In your case you are probably

[16:33 - 16:39]
competing on what you know I would say

[16:36 - 16:41]
better right? So more thorough and only

[16:39 - 16:43]
on that because it's actually like worse

[16:41 - 16:46]
on the others. It's slower takes more

[16:43 - 16:47]
work. It's not really faster. It's just

[16:46 - 16:50]
more effective but it's not it's

[16:47 - 16:52]
definitely not easier. No.

[16:50 - 16:55]
But I'm sure you see the info marketing

[16:52 - 16:58]
style of this, right? uh which is

[16:55 - 16:59]
get-richqu style or get productive quick

[16:58 - 17:00]
style offers and and they are

[16:59 - 17:03]
successful. So I think that's the

[17:00 - 17:06]
framework to approach it by the the last

[17:03 - 17:08]
one is cheaper and I would suggest not

[17:06 - 17:10]
competing on cheaper um just because

[17:08 - 17:13]
again that affects your margins which

[17:10 - 17:14]
means you don't have much of a business

[17:13 - 17:16]
future. You can only compete on cheaper

[17:14 - 17:17]
if you have you know other major

[17:16 - 17:19]
advantages. So, I think what this is

[17:17 - 17:24]
going to make me add is to just

[17:19 - 17:29]
highlight my offerings tend to be more

[17:24 - 17:32]
effective than others, but also require

[17:29 - 17:34]
some time and investment of effort to

[17:32 - 17:36]
get results. This isn't a straight a

[17:34 - 17:37]
straightforward like this is how I'm

[17:36 - 17:40]
better. It's sort of how I'm different,

[17:37 - 17:42]
I guess. So, right now it's important to

[17:40 - 17:44]
contrast. So right now you're talking

[17:42 - 17:47]
about what your offering is, not what

[17:44 - 17:48]
your offering could be. Right? So I

[17:47 - 17:51]
think it's important just to say this is

[17:48 - 17:53]
reality today. You can then once you

[17:51 - 17:56]
have reality documented, you can then

[17:53 - 17:58]
have aspirations documented and you can

[17:56 - 18:00]
start to think about that. You can also

[17:58 - 18:02]
add it here. As I go through this

[18:00 - 18:05]
process, I'm realizing that I need to

[18:02 - 18:08]
think about this and perhaps focus on

[18:05 - 18:09]
the differentiator being speed as an

[18:08 - 18:11]
example. Yeah, it'd be nice if I could

[18:09 - 18:13]
maintain effectiveness and then start

[18:11 - 18:15]
increasing the others. I'll leave that

[18:13 - 18:16]
as a first pass for now. Who are your

[18:15 - 18:18]
competitors and what do they offer

[18:16 - 18:20]
that's similar or different? What comes

[18:18 - 18:22]
to mind here is it depends on the

[18:20 - 18:24]
product. Like my books have very

[18:22 - 18:27]
different competitors than say our

[18:24 - 18:28]
membership. Should I like pick our most

[18:27 - 18:30]
important product for this? Yeah, in

[18:28 - 18:31]
this case, I mean you can mention it in

[18:30 - 18:33]
the master prompt about that

[18:31 - 18:35]
differentiation. I would I would say

[18:33 - 18:37]
take your highest revenue product or

[18:35 - 18:38]
service. Okay. And then I think I'll

[18:37 - 18:41]
even say that for the second brain

[18:38 - 18:44]
membership, it's kind of our main source

[18:41 - 18:48]
of revenue and flagship product. Our

[18:44 - 18:50]
competitors are other courses,

[18:48 - 18:52]
memberships,

[18:50 - 18:57]
communities accelerators

[18:52 - 19:01]
coaching programs, etc. that offer

[18:57 - 19:05]
exclusive content, training, events,

[19:01 - 19:09]
networking, etc. such as I'll think of

[19:05 - 19:11]
like Ali Abd Doll's productivity lab

[19:09 - 19:13]
writer Carol's membership. It's funny

[19:11 - 19:15]
cuz I'm like friends with all these

[19:13 - 19:19]
people also

[19:15 - 19:25]
Nick Milo's accelerator

[19:19 - 19:27]
program and Ann Lur Lump

[19:25 - 19:31]
Nest Labs community. What's interesting

[19:27 - 19:33]
here again is that because your ICP

[19:31 - 19:36]
isn't that targeted, it's fairly

[19:33 - 19:37]
difficult to answer. Um, actually a lot

[19:36 - 19:39]
of these other people also don't have

[19:37 - 19:41]
super targeted ICPS. It would be

[19:39 - 19:44]
interesting if you explored looking at

[19:41 - 19:47]
like a very segmented ICP for leadership

[19:44 - 19:48]
teams and then understanding who exists

[19:47 - 19:50]
in that sector. There's basically a

[19:48 - 19:52]
whole another pass. I could look at each

[19:50 - 19:54]
one of these questions through the lens

[19:52 - 19:56]
of like going a level deeper. Yeah. What

[19:54 - 19:57]
I would say is, yeah, you're looking at

[19:56 - 20:00]
this through the lens of a pretty broad

[19:57 - 20:03]
ICP, and these are your competitors on a

[20:00 - 20:05]
pretty broad ICP, which is low ticket,

[20:03 - 20:08]
potentially low urgency, broad range.

[20:05 - 20:10]
Yes. And not a ton of differentiation.

[20:08 - 20:11]
Yes. Right. In the offer. But if you

[20:10 - 20:12]
looked at some of these others, you

[20:11 - 20:14]
would definitely find these other

[20:12 - 20:15]
companies, they may not be in the form

[20:14 - 20:18]
of a book or a course. They may be in

[20:15 - 20:20]
the form of workshops, um, speaking

[20:18 - 20:21]
engagements, right? More high ticket.

[20:20 - 20:24]
So, we're seeing the downstream effects

[20:21 - 20:27]
of that broad ideal customer profile.

[20:24 - 20:30]
Who's currently on your team? So, I'll

[20:27 - 20:32]
just say Julia, general manager. We have

[20:30 - 20:34]
a pretty small team, so I can answer

[20:32 - 20:37]
this pretty succinctly. Rebecca, ops

[20:34 - 20:42]
manager. Nikolai,

[20:37 - 20:45]
YouTube editor and strategist. And

[20:42 - 20:48]
Alysia YouTube

[20:45 - 20:49]
project manager and strategist. I'm not

[20:48 - 20:50]
going to add salaries. That's

[20:49 - 20:52]
confidential, but is there anything else

[20:50 - 20:53]
that you would put here for a small team

[20:52 - 20:56]
like this one? Maybe if there are

[20:53 - 20:58]
important contractors involved. A

[20:56 - 21:01]
thumbnail designer is a surprisingly

[20:58 - 21:03]
important contractor. Patrick web

[21:01 - 21:06]
master. I think I want to differentiate

[21:03 - 21:08]
here like for contractors. I don't want

[21:06 - 21:11]
it to assume that these people are, you

[21:08 - 21:13]
know, around all the time. Uh Maya

[21:11 - 21:15]
designer. Okay. Okay, for each core team

[21:13 - 21:17]
member, so I'll focus on the full-time

[21:15 - 21:19]
staff. What is their most important

[21:17 - 21:21]
performance metric or success target?

[21:19 - 21:25]
What is a performance metric or success

[21:21 - 21:28]
target? Performance metric, KPI, success

[21:25 - 21:30]
metric. It's it's a very generic term

[21:28 - 21:32]
and it has a lot of different

[21:30 - 21:34]
interpretations. Let's say to ask like

[21:32 - 21:36]
what is a good KPI or what is a good

[21:34 - 21:40]
success metric would be in this example

[21:36 - 21:42]
again what is a leading indicator that

[21:40 - 21:44]
is controllable by Nikolai that is

[21:42 - 21:46]
directly tied to the outcome of the

[21:44 - 21:48]
highest level process. So leading

[21:46 - 21:50]
indicator which could you say what you

[21:48 - 21:51]
mean by leading? It would be something

[21:50 - 21:53]
that Nikolai can control. So for

[21:51 - 21:54]
example, this is hard on a YouTube video

[21:53 - 21:56]
cuz I don't know YouTube. It's more like

[21:54 - 21:59]
an activity metric. So it would probably

[21:56 - 22:02]
be something around like the actual

[21:59 - 22:04]
number of videos that he outlines would

[22:02 - 22:07]
be a leading indicator. Target versus

[22:04 - 22:10]
actual. The number of ideas that he

[22:07 - 22:11]
identifies, plans, sort of strategizes

[22:10 - 22:13]
around. Yeah. Cuz that then would tie to

[22:11 - 22:16]
the number of videos that get published

[22:13 - 22:18]
that they would then tie to the number

[22:16 - 22:19]
of views that you get. So that's leading

[22:18 - 22:21]
because it happens early in the process,

[22:19 - 22:22]
right? And it's controllable by him. So

[22:21 - 22:24]
say what you mean by controllable. Poor

[22:22 - 22:26]
metric would be something that he can't

[22:24 - 22:27]
control. It could be something like the

[22:26 - 22:29]
number of videos published. If he's not

[22:27 - 22:31]
part of that process, he can't control

[22:29 - 22:33]
that. So he could make 50 great

[22:31 - 22:35]
outlines, but the person on the

[22:33 - 22:37]
production side doesn't publish them.

[22:35 - 22:39]
And now he's punished for that. So when

[22:37 - 22:41]
you say controllable, does it have to be

[22:39 - 22:44]
completely controllable just by him?

[22:41 - 22:46]
Fully within his control. Ideally fully

[22:44 - 22:49]
within his control, but also as closely

[22:46 - 22:50]
tied to the outcome of the process above

[22:49 - 22:52]
him as possible. What do you mean by

[22:50 - 22:55]
process above him? So when we said his

[22:52 - 22:58]
process is plan a YouTube video but the

[22:55 - 23:00]
process above was organic YouTube

[22:58 - 23:01]
marketing right and so you know the

[23:00 - 23:03]
outcome of organic YouTube marketing

[23:01 - 23:05]
might be marketing qualified leads but

[23:03 - 23:06]
he needs to understand when you design

[23:05 - 23:08]
the process you need to understand what

[23:06 - 23:11]
is the outcome that's directly tied to

[23:08 - 23:13]
it leading controllable and directly

[23:11 - 23:14]
tied to the outcome. Yeah. I wonder if I

[23:13 - 23:16]
could come up with these for Julia. Oh

[23:14 - 23:17]
one other thing is that it should not be

[23:16 - 23:19]
a vanity metric. What do you mean by a

[23:17 - 23:22]
vanity metric? a vanity metric. I mean,

[23:19 - 23:23]
it's kind of similar to directly to tied

[23:22 - 23:25]
to the outcome, but a vanity metric

[23:23 - 23:27]
would be like number of subscribers,

[23:25 - 23:29]
number of views. Those are like mostly

[23:27 - 23:31]
what YouTubers count because it's

[23:29 - 23:32]
vanity, right? It's just does that

[23:31 - 23:36]
actually tie to revenue. You may have a

[23:32 - 23:38]
video that has 700,000 views and you're

[23:36 - 23:39]
all chuffed about it, but most of those

[23:38 - 23:40]
views weren't for your ideal client,

[23:39 - 23:42]
which is usually the case. It went

[23:40 - 23:44]
viral. Exactly. It didn't do anything

[23:42 - 23:47]
for the business. There's four criteria

[23:44 - 23:49]
for Julia. Since these she's the general

[23:47 - 23:52]
manager of the whole business, my first

[23:49 - 23:53]
instinct is to put profit. Can the

[23:52 - 23:56]
profitability of the whole company be a

[23:53 - 23:58]
KPI? 100%. For a GM, it's P like P&L

[23:56 - 24:00]
control. That's usually what it is.

[23:58 - 24:01]
Obviously, it's tied to per strategic

[24:00 - 24:03]
planning outcome is the financial

[24:01 - 24:05]
performance. It's profit is not a

[24:03 - 24:07]
leading indicator. In fact, it is the

[24:05 - 24:09]
ultimate lagging indicator. Interesting.

[24:07 - 24:11]
Right. There's a concept called the

[24:09 - 24:13]
balance score scorecard and basically it

[24:11 - 24:15]
takes everything to say that there kind

[24:13 - 24:16]
of four areas of leading to lagging from

[24:15 - 24:18]
bottom to top and they flow up. Actually

[24:16 - 24:20]
at the bottom you have people and you

[24:18 - 24:21]
have training and then you have

[24:20 - 24:24]
processes on the second level. On the

[24:21 - 24:25]
third level you have execution and then

[24:24 - 24:26]
finally you have finance and so

[24:25 - 24:28]
everything always flows up. So that's

[24:26 - 24:30]
leading all the way to lagging. So it

[24:28 - 24:31]
should start with people. It could if

[24:30 - 24:33]
you wanted to make it leading. So you

[24:31 - 24:35]
might give her ultimately two. One could

[24:33 - 24:40]
be the most important outcome which is

[24:35 - 24:42]
NOI NOI net operating income. Okay. Um

[24:40 - 24:45]
profit

[24:42 - 24:47]
or it might be ultimately on the

[24:45 - 24:48]
execution side or even on the process

[24:47 - 24:50]
side. It depends what your focus is.

[24:48 - 24:53]
What comes to mind for this when I think

[24:50 - 24:55]
about what is way upstream of profit? I

[24:53 - 24:56]
kind of think for us it's launches.

[24:55 - 24:58]
Almost all our revenue even for the

[24:56 - 25:01]
subscription product which is is a

[24:58 - 25:02]
recurring revenue product. How people

[25:01 - 25:04]
come into it is when we do at least a

[25:02 - 25:05]
small launch at least just like this is

[25:04 - 25:08]
a new feature that we launched or here's

[25:05 - 25:10]
a new exclusive event. Would number of

[25:08 - 25:11]
launches per month or per quarter be a

[25:10 - 25:13]
good one? That would be a great leading

[25:11 - 25:15]
indicator. Yeah. How many KPIs should

[25:13 - 25:17]
each person have? Everyone needs to have

[25:15 - 25:18]
at least one number and I would say if

[25:17 - 25:20]
everyone has more than like three

[25:18 - 25:23]
numbers, that's probably too much

[25:20 - 25:25]
dilution. So I would say one to three. I

[25:23 - 25:27]
personally like to do two cuz I find

[25:25 - 25:29]
that one tends to get you the lagging

[25:27 - 25:31]
indicator only. You could say if you did

[25:29 - 25:33]
two, you could have one lagging, one one

[25:31 - 25:35]
leading. I like that. So number of

[25:33 - 25:37]
product launches leading. For the

[25:35 - 25:39]
lagging one, would you just say is it

[25:37 - 25:42]
better to have a like a an absolute

[25:39 - 25:44]
number for profit or a percentage? So

[25:42 - 25:46]
usually it's it's goal versus actual for

[25:44 - 25:48]
all of these things. So you're the CEO

[25:46 - 25:50]
of the company, right? And so it's your

[25:48 - 25:52]
job to actually go out and create goals

[25:50 - 25:54]
for the company and communicate those

[25:52 - 25:56]
goals. Uh Julie as your GM needs to

[25:54 - 25:58]
execute on those goals. And so if you

[25:56 - 26:00]
say the goal is I want to make a million

[25:58 - 26:02]
dollars in profit this year ultimately

[26:00 - 26:03]
is she hitting the goal right she she

[26:02 - 26:05]
agrees to the goal is she hitting the

[26:03 - 26:07]
goal if you're if you say I want to do

[26:05 - 26:09]
eight launches this year how does she do

[26:07 - 26:11]
or I want to do two launches this

[26:09 - 26:13]
quarter so almost always your your KPIs

[26:11 - 26:16]
are goals versus target it's not that

[26:13 - 26:17]
just the higher the better. No no

[26:16 - 26:19]
because it needs to be realistic right

[26:17 - 26:22]
it needs to be constrained to your

[26:19 - 26:24]
actual resources and abilities target

[26:22 - 26:25]
versus actual. I don't think I'm gonna

[26:24 - 26:27]
add that for every one though, just for

[26:25 - 26:29]
the sake of simplicity. I think I'll

[26:27 - 26:31]
just say profitability. Net operating.

[26:29 - 26:33]
What' you say? Net operating income.

[26:31 - 26:34]
Yeah. And for each of these, I'll keep

[26:33 - 26:37]
in mind or I'll make a note that it's

[26:34 - 26:39]
target versus actual. For Rebecca, I'm

[26:37 - 26:41]
going to put something like this one's

[26:39 - 26:43]
harder because she has quite a range of

[26:41 - 26:45]
operational and administrative tasks

[26:43 - 26:46]
that I don't have much visibility into.

[26:45 - 26:48]
I guess I could say like what do you

[26:46 - 26:49]
call it when they have a customer

[26:48 - 26:52]
support email and they're like good with

[26:49 - 26:55]
it. Customer satisfaction. Yeah. NPS.

[26:52 - 26:57]
But that's a lagging, right? Not really.

[26:55 - 26:59]
Like if you actually think about lagging

[26:57 - 27:00]
would be a turned customer. The absolute

[26:59 - 27:02]
lead, if you're looking at like customer

[27:00 - 27:03]
satisfaction, the absolute leading would

[27:02 - 27:06]
be something around how quickly do they

[27:03 - 27:08]
deal with tickets and how well rated are

[27:06 - 27:11]
those. Somewhere in the middle might be

[27:08 - 27:13]
the actual ratings or an NPS, a net

[27:11 - 27:15]
promoter score. But typically for

[27:13 - 27:18]
operations, this is about quality. NPS

[27:15 - 27:19]
is usually used as part of customer

[27:18 - 27:21]
success. But now I'm getting into

[27:19 - 27:22]
aspirational things that we don't

[27:21 - 27:24]
actually do. So I should stick to what

[27:22 - 27:27]
we currently do. If you don't actually

[27:24 - 27:28]
report on KPIs, then you kind of have to

[27:27 - 27:30]
be aspirational. Okay, that's true.

[27:28 - 27:32]
Okay, we're being aspirational. For

[27:30 - 27:34]
Nikolai and Allesia, they live together.

[27:32 - 27:36]
They're partners, so they work as such a

[27:34 - 27:38]
integral team. I almost want to give

[27:36 - 27:39]
them the same KPIs. I guess I don't know

[27:38 - 27:42]
enough about how they divide their

[27:39 - 27:45]
responsibilities. That's fair. Number of

[27:42 - 27:49]
video concepts or like prepared video

[27:45 - 27:53]
concepts. That was an example for a

[27:49 - 27:55]
guide around preparing video concepts,

[27:53 - 27:57]
but actually they're responsible for a

[27:55 - 27:59]
higher level process which is the entire

[27:57 - 28:01]
YouTube marketing. So that would

[27:59 - 28:02]
probably be the So I'll tell you what

[28:01 - 28:05]
most people think. They would say number

[28:02 - 28:08]
of views and number of subscribers both

[28:05 - 28:10]
of which I don't think is true. I think

[28:08 - 28:12]
it's actually what are the number of

[28:10 - 28:14]
qualified leads because again we're

[28:12 - 28:16]
going marketto lead. If you publish a

[28:14 - 28:18]
YouTube video, your metric shouldn't be

[28:16 - 28:20]
how many views do I get? Your metric

[28:18 - 28:22]
should be how many emails do I get? And

[28:20 - 28:23]
are those emails from my customer, my

[28:22 - 28:26]
ICP? Because if you get a bunch of

[28:23 - 28:28]
emails, then they're from people in a

[28:26 - 28:30]
different country outside of your ICP

[28:28 - 28:31]
with a totally different demographic,

[28:30 - 28:34]
they're not that useful. But doesn't all

[28:31 - 28:36]
that fall under qualification? Yep.

[28:34 - 28:37]
That's why it qualified for leading. I

[28:36 - 28:39]
think I'll say number of videos

[28:37 - 28:42]
published,

[28:39 - 28:46]
right? Oh boy.

[28:42 - 28:49]
Okay. Okay, I'd say the flagship is the

[28:46 - 28:51]
second brain membership and I'll just

[28:49 - 28:56]
say recurring

[28:51 - 29:01]
subscription for 650 a year. BASB

[28:56 - 29:05]
foundation and pillars of productivity

[29:01 - 29:07]
courses which are $4.99

[29:05 - 29:08]
and $250

[29:07 - 29:13]
respectively.

[29:08 - 29:16]
a number of books averaging $15

[29:13 - 29:19]
and Second Brain Enterprise, which is

[29:16 - 29:20]
currently or at least was 10,000. What

[29:19 - 29:22]
new products or services are you

[29:20 - 29:25]
planning to offer in the future? Not

[29:22 - 29:27]
really any besides those.

[29:25 - 29:29]
No plans. So, I like its guidance here.

[29:27 - 29:33]
I think I'll describe them collectively

[29:29 - 29:37]
as information products that offer

[29:33 - 29:41]
instruction, training, and education

[29:37 - 29:45]
around use of technology either in the

[29:41 - 29:47]
form of a book, course, membership, or

[29:45 - 29:50]
cohort. It's basically saying that

[29:47 - 29:52]
wasn't good enough.

[29:50 - 29:55]
Please be more specific. Good job, Chat

[29:52 - 29:59]
GBT. Yeah, it's not letting me be lazy.

[29:55 - 30:01]
Dang it. is a membersonly.

[29:59 - 30:05]
See how how simple I can get away with

[30:01 - 30:10]
that offers networking and ongoing

[30:05 - 30:14]
training in PKM. The courses offer

[30:10 - 30:18]
curricula in frameworks

[30:14 - 30:23]
or personal productivity and our books

[30:18 - 30:27]
contain the core info related to PKM

[30:23 - 30:29]
productivity and related topics. So one

[30:27 - 30:32]
one comment there is those are all

[30:29 - 30:34]
features not benefits, right? And so you

[30:32 - 30:36]
could say that second brain membership

[30:34 - 30:39]
offers community and community

[30:36 - 30:41]
accountability as a benefit. Meet peers,

[30:39 - 30:42]
meet other people interested in it.

[30:41 - 30:44]
Problem it solves could be loneliness.

[30:42 - 30:46]
The problem it solves could be a lack of

[30:44 - 30:48]
access to peers in your local friend

[30:46 - 30:51]
group. And the courses probably offer

[30:48 - 30:53]
accountability and structure that the

[30:51 - 30:55]
books don't. Right? So again, those are

[30:53 - 30:56]
benefits versus the features. So would

[30:55 - 30:58]
you try to include both features and

[30:56 - 31:01]
benefits? That's what it asked for. Did

[30:58 - 31:03]
it? Oh, dang. I missed that. Okay,

[31:01 - 31:05]
Chachi BT, you're letting me get away

[31:03 - 31:07]
get away with too much. Luckily, we have

[31:05 - 31:09]
Hayden here as well. I'll save that for

[31:07 - 31:10]
a second pass later on. What the heck

[31:09 - 31:12]
are core values and how do I know what

[31:10 - 31:14]
they are? If you've ever worked in a

[31:12 - 31:16]
company or owned a company that had good

[31:14 - 31:18]
core values, it is a game changer. And

[31:16 - 31:20]
if you've worked in a company that had

[31:18 - 31:22]
bad core values, meaning they weren't

[31:20 - 31:24]
real, they weren't true, it was probably

[31:22 - 31:26]
worse that they had those values than if

[31:24 - 31:28]
they hadn't had them at all. A good

[31:26 - 31:30]
value is a fact. It's not an aspiration.

[31:28 - 31:34]
It's real. And they don't need to be

[31:30 - 31:36]
good traits. They need to be real. Your

[31:34 - 31:39]
values attract who works at your company

[31:36 - 31:40]
and who succeeds in your company. Who

[31:39 - 31:42]
gets promoted? Who gets hired? Who gets

[31:40 - 31:45]
fired is based on values and basically

[31:42 - 31:48]
showing anti- values. Ultimately, it's

[31:45 - 31:49]
what gives a company. So, it gives a

[31:48 - 31:51]
couple different things. It's a

[31:49 - 31:52]
decision-m framework for you. It gives

[31:51 - 31:54]
you speed, but it also gives you

[31:52 - 31:56]
culture. It gives you something unique

[31:54 - 31:58]
to follow. One of the interesting ways

[31:56 - 31:59]
to look at values in a small business is

[31:58 - 32:01]
you actually look at the strengths and

[31:59 - 32:04]
the weaknesses that you listed because

[32:01 - 32:06]
often the values and the DNA of the

[32:04 - 32:08]
founder spill over into the

[32:06 - 32:09]
organization. I can say like right now

[32:08 - 32:11]
based on some of the strengths and

[32:09 - 32:12]
weaknesses you showed thoughtful

[32:11 - 32:14]
thorough you had those both for for

[32:12 - 32:16]
strength like personal like learning

[32:14 - 32:18]
voracious learner and then some of the

[32:16 - 32:20]
things you said were weaknesses esoteric

[32:18 - 32:23]
not financially focused easy to boredom.

[32:20 - 32:25]
How do those express themselves as

[32:23 - 32:27]
values in the company and culture? I'm

[32:25 - 32:29]
not sure because so I'll give you an

[32:27 - 32:31]
example. I have a set of personal

[32:29 - 32:33]
principles that I think I'm pretty aware

[32:31 - 32:34]
of, but I'm not completely sure if they

[32:33 - 32:36]
translate directly to organization

[32:34 - 32:38]
values. For example, um I have a

[32:36 - 32:40]
personal principle to just always follow

[32:38 - 32:42]
where my curiosity leads. I don't know

[32:40 - 32:43]
if I want everyone in the organization

[32:42 - 32:45]
to do that. You know what I mean? Do I

[32:43 - 32:47]
need to like translate it to an

[32:45 - 32:49]
organizational context? I would say your

[32:47 - 32:51]
brand does it. If you're curious about

[32:49 - 32:54]
something, you follow that curiosity.

[32:51 - 32:57]
Your brand publishes it. Right now, you

[32:54 - 32:58]
are conflating who you are, Thiago, with

[32:57 - 33:00]
what the brand is. So, if you thought

[32:58 - 33:01]
about like removing yourself from the

[33:00 - 33:04]
company, but the company continuing to

[33:01 - 33:05]
run itself, would you make that a trait

[33:04 - 33:07]
in the brand? In which case, it probably

[33:05 - 33:09]
would become a value. It's like follow

[33:07 - 33:11]
your curiosity as a value. That's what

[33:09 - 33:13]
you talk about. That's what you do. The

[33:11 - 33:14]
expression of voracious learning and

[33:13 - 33:16]
curiosity in an organization could be

[33:14 - 33:18]
around having 20% time, right? that like

[33:16 - 33:20]
Google used to have giving people the

[33:18 - 33:22]
time to follow their curiosity and build

[33:20 - 33:24]
things. Another way especially for

[33:22 - 33:26]
slightly larger companies or companies

[33:24 - 33:29]
who been around a long time which you

[33:26 - 33:31]
have is what people have succeeded in

[33:29 - 33:33]
your company and what traits what common

[33:31 - 33:34]
traits do they have and also the anti-

[33:33 - 33:36]
values is what people have not

[33:34 - 33:38]
succeeded. They were just horrible

[33:36 - 33:40]
hires. Life was so much better after you

[33:38 - 33:42]
fired them and what traits common traits

[33:40 - 33:44]
did they have. That brings to mind uh

[33:42 - 33:46]
very high autonomy. You basically have

[33:44 - 33:48]
to be almost completely autonomous in

[33:46 - 33:50]
this in this team because no one's going

[33:48 - 33:52]
to tell you what to do next. So what

[33:50 - 33:54]
autonomy I think I think that is yeah

[33:52 - 33:56]
autonomy for the curiosity thing you

[33:54 - 33:58]
mentioned how I would separate myself

[33:56 - 33:59]
from the brand. So I'm trying to imagine

[33:58 - 34:01]
like if I were to sell the company

[33:59 - 34:03]
imagine and just and step away and exit.

[34:01 - 34:04]
But then I almost think well then in

[34:03 - 34:06]
that case I would just want them to

[34:04 - 34:08]
stick to exactly what I said. I wouldn't

[34:06 - 34:09]
want them to go follow their curiosity

[34:08 - 34:11]
to all these different things still

[34:09 - 34:13]
using my name probably. I would fear

[34:11 - 34:15]
that loss of control. So, it's almost

[34:13 - 34:17]
like that my value would flip from

[34:15 - 34:19]
open-ended curiosity to quality control

[34:17 - 34:22]
and consistency. I kind of look at it

[34:19 - 34:24]
from a customer centric perspective. Why

[34:22 - 34:26]
do people follow Forte Labs? It's a

[34:24 - 34:29]
great question. I don't know.

[34:26 - 34:31]
Anyway, I think I I would I do I would

[34:29 - 34:32]
agree that autonomy is definitely one of

[34:31 - 34:33]
your your values. Like people who've

[34:32 - 34:35]
succeeded are autonomous. People who

[34:33 - 34:37]
haven't are likely not. You could be

[34:35 - 34:39]
more specific. You could say initiative,

[34:37 - 34:41]
self-directed. You could phrase it as a

[34:39 - 34:42]
sentence. I would recommend two things

[34:41 - 34:44]
like phrasing it as a sentence also

[34:42 - 34:46]
actually turning it into an acronym

[34:44 - 34:47]
which by the way chat GP is great at.

[34:46 - 34:49]
Yeah. For someone being introduced to

[34:47 - 34:51]
this for the first time would you have

[34:49 - 34:53]
them try to identify like three just as

[34:51 - 34:55]
a first initial pass at this? Yep. I

[34:53 - 34:57]
think that's that's a good start.

[34:55 - 34:58]
Usually there's like a leading almost

[34:57 - 35:00]
always there's a leading value in the

[34:58 - 35:03]
company and that's often like the people

[35:00 - 35:05]
value. For us we have our core values

[35:03 - 35:06]
spell serve and I guess for people who

[35:05 - 35:08]
know me like the first value is

[35:06 - 35:10]
systematic excellence. I see everything

[35:08 - 35:12]
in systems. Personally, we have two

[35:10 - 35:13]
values. The the V and SE serve is

[35:12 - 35:16]
voracious learning. Those would be like

[35:13 - 35:17]
the two I'd say leading values in our

[35:16 - 35:19]
company, but we do try to obviously look

[35:17 - 35:21]
at all five. Is there like a assessment

[35:19 - 35:23]
or quiz that you recommend for people to

[35:21 - 35:24]
walk through for this the core values

[35:23 - 35:26]
specifically? Not that I know of

[35:24 - 35:27]
probably. I'm sure there is. Ask Chat

[35:26 - 35:29]
GP.

[35:27 - 35:32]
So, the three that come to mind are

[35:29 - 35:34]
autonomy, authenticity, and then to

[35:32 - 35:36]
balance authenticity's effectiveness. I

[35:34 - 35:37]
feel like what reigns in, you know, it's

[35:36 - 35:40]
like follow your heart and your

[35:37 - 35:42]
curiosity, but like we're here to serve.

[35:40 - 35:44]
We're here to be useful to people. We're

[35:42 - 35:45]
here to do things that actually make

[35:44 - 35:46]
sense. I would agree with that with

[35:45 - 35:48]
everyone I've dealt with on your team.

[35:46 - 35:50]
I'd say they've all shown that. I think

[35:48 - 35:52]
there's something innately like giving

[35:50 - 35:54]
about you and your brand. I think you

[35:52 - 35:56]
want to try to give everything away for

[35:54 - 35:58]
free. Yeah. Sort of using you as a

[35:56 - 36:00]
sounding board here. Generosity. Good

[35:58 - 36:03]
enough for a first pass. What is your

[36:00 - 36:05]
organization's mission? Oh boy. My first

[36:03 - 36:07]
instinct is just to make people more

[36:05 - 36:09]
productive so that they're more

[36:07 - 36:10]
fulfilled so that they're happier in

[36:09 - 36:12]
their lives, but that feels broad to me.

[36:10 - 36:15]
Maybe I think it's fine to be broad. I

[36:12 - 36:16]
say with their work and lives. Your

[36:15 - 36:19]
formula here, your Mad Libs version of

[36:16 - 36:22]
this, right, would be like we make

[36:19 - 36:23]
target ideal customer. Maybe there's a

[36:22 - 36:26]
better way of looking at this is we

[36:23 - 36:29]
solve X problem for target customer in

[36:26 - 36:32]
order for target outcome. Uh this goes

[36:29 - 36:34]
back to my ICP problem. like people who

[36:32 - 36:36]
are already really high functioning but

[36:34 - 36:40]
they they're so smart it's messing up

[36:36 - 36:42]
their lives. I I hate to say make high

[36:40 - 36:43]
functioning people even more effective

[36:42 - 36:45]
but there is something to that. We're

[36:43 - 36:47]
not really serving people that are at a

[36:45 - 36:49]
a low level of functioning either in

[36:47 - 36:51]
their career or in life. So how about we

[36:49 - 36:54]
help high functioning people? So what

[36:51 - 36:56]
did you phrase this before? It was um

[36:54 - 36:59]
relief. Yeah. Right. Relieve their

[36:56 - 37:01]
stress, relieve their overwhelm.

[36:59 - 37:03]
overwhelm their sense of overwhelm so

[37:01 - 37:05]
they can live then if you really want to

[37:03 - 37:07]
get into it you could say buy what is it

[37:05 - 37:09]
that you do delivering educational

[37:07 - 37:11]
experiences this is turning a little bit

[37:09 - 37:13]
more into a value proposition than a

[37:11 - 37:15]
mission though you might want to get rid

[37:13 - 37:16]
of the the buy you're going into value

[37:15 - 37:17]
prop I would just say so benefit which

[37:16 - 37:20]
you have so they can live more

[37:17 - 37:21]
productive fulfilled and happy lives

[37:20 - 37:23]
yeah this is I think this is our mission

[37:21 - 37:24]
more or less okay you should put that on

[37:23 - 37:27]
your website that is what we spend all

[37:24 - 37:28]
day every day doing

[37:27 - 37:31]
what's the biggest most audacious ious

[37:28 - 37:32]
long-term goal for Forte Labs. My first

[37:31 - 37:35]
let me tell you my first instinct is

[37:32 - 37:39]
just to it's like change the mainstream

[37:35 - 37:41]
understanding or the mainstream practice

[37:39 - 37:44]
of our topics personal productivity

[37:41 - 37:47]
note-taking PKM AI change it in which

[37:44 - 37:50]
way? Make it more realistic, more

[37:47 - 37:52]
researchbacked, more practical, more

[37:50 - 37:54]
with a higher ROI. It's like so many

[37:52 - 37:56]
different dimensions. Do I need to pick

[37:54 - 37:58]
one? What is the ultimate

[37:56 - 38:00]
transformational outcome of the world if

[37:58 - 38:02]
that happened? What isn't the

[38:00 - 38:03]
transformational outcome? Well, what's

[38:02 - 38:05]
the one that you you're seeing, right,

[38:03 - 38:07]
that excites you? It's the most

[38:05 - 38:09]
fundamental feelings that dictate

[38:07 - 38:11]
people's day-to-day experience, their

[38:09 - 38:14]
self-confidence, their agency, their

[38:11 - 38:16]
optimism and hope, their level of

[38:14 - 38:18]
ambition. All those things are raised

[38:16 - 38:21]
with your better education. Okay? So,

[38:18 - 38:23]
phrase that in an absolutely audacious

[38:21 - 38:24]
way in terms of like it makes you

[38:23 - 38:26]
uncomfortable to say it out loud. Jim

[38:24 - 38:28]
Collins calls this a bee hag, a big

[38:26 - 38:29]
hairy audacious goal. Peter Diamantis

[38:28 - 38:32]
calls it a massive transformational

[38:29 - 38:34]
purpose, an MTP. Some examples, Google's

[38:32 - 38:37]
is to organize the world's data. That

[38:34 - 38:40]
was at the time a laughably audacious

[38:37 - 38:41]
goal back in 99 or whatever. And now

[38:40 - 38:43]
it's like, oh yeah, they did that. I

[38:41 - 38:45]
feel like it's this because it's like

[38:43 - 38:46]
it's like there's a meta level in our

[38:45 - 38:48]
company. We are an education company,

[38:46 - 38:51]
but also the topics we are teaching

[38:48 - 38:52]
themselves are educa. Like productivity

[38:51 - 38:54]
is you have to be productive and

[38:52 - 38:56]
organized to learn. You also need to

[38:54 - 38:58]
take good notes. You need to leverage

[38:56 - 38:59]
AI. You need to have self-awareness. So,

[38:58 - 39:01]
it's like there's this feedback loop.

[38:59 - 39:04]
How could you phrase that in a way that

[39:01 - 39:05]
was more measurable? Gosh, you know,

[39:04 - 39:07]
it's funny. The the first one that comes

[39:05 - 39:10]
to mind is is that everyone would make

[39:07 - 39:12]
way more money.

[39:10 - 39:13]
Cuz I kind of feel like that's like one

[39:12 - 39:15]
of the real bottlenecks, life

[39:13 - 39:16]
satisfaction and fulfillment. Because

[39:15 - 39:18]
like you you need the funding. It's one

[39:16 - 39:20]
reason we focus on people's careers cuz

[39:18 - 39:21]
then you improve in your career, you

[39:20 - 39:23]
increase your income, and then you have

[39:21 - 39:25]
funding for all the other pursuits. So

[39:23 - 39:26]
here here's something I'm thinking, and

[39:25 - 39:29]
obviously this is me, so it's not you,

[39:26 - 39:31]
but the book multipliers talks about

[39:29 - 39:33]
actively measuring how productive and

[39:31 - 39:35]
engaged employees are in companies and

[39:33 - 39:37]
basically saying, hey, what on average

[39:35 - 39:39]
people are like under 50% productive?

[39:37 - 39:41]
Literally, if you could get people to

[39:39 - 39:44]
90% productive, imagine the effect on

[39:41 - 39:47]
the company. If you could get the world

[39:44 - 39:50]
to 90% effective from 40% effective,

[39:47 - 39:51]
imagine the impact on society. Yeah.

[39:50 - 39:53]
What if you were to double the

[39:51 - 39:55]
effectiveness of the world? And

[39:53 - 39:57]
productivity can be measured through

[39:55 - 40:00]
personal transformation. I Dude, that's

[39:57 - 40:03]
that's an awesome one. We double the

[40:00 - 40:05]
level of global productivity, which is

[40:03 - 40:07]
on a downward trend by the way over

[40:05 - 40:09]
decades through personal. Yeah. It's not

[40:07 - 40:10]
about oh by adopting so- and so

[40:09 - 40:12]
technology. It's all all about the

[40:10 - 40:15]
person. There was a really interesting

[40:12 - 40:18]
quote that organizational change comes

[40:15 - 40:20]
from the cumulative effect of personal

[40:18 - 40:21]
transformation. Yeah. Why does

[40:20 - 40:23]
productivity matter? Cuz then you have

[40:21 - 40:25]
the time, the resources, the money,

[40:23 - 40:27]
everything to do even more personal

[40:25 - 40:29]
transformation. I really think as AI

[40:27 - 40:31]
unleashes our bandwidth, that would be

[40:29 - 40:33]
the best use of our time, every form of

[40:31 - 40:35]
personal transformation. There's like a

[40:33 - 40:36]
feedback loop between these two

[40:35 - 40:38]
elements, global productivity, personal

[40:36 - 40:40]
transformation. That was very well put

[40:38 - 40:42]
by you.

[40:40 - 40:46]
Okay, got to share that with the team.

[40:42 - 40:47]
That was all 24 questions that it's now

[40:46 - 40:49]
put into what's called a canvas, which

[40:47 - 40:51]
is just basically a document. So, now

[40:49 - 40:53]
that we have the master prompt, I'm

[40:51 - 40:56]
going to go ahead and download this as a

[40:53 - 40:58]
PDF by clicking right here. I'll call it

[40:56 - 41:00]
Thiago's master prompt. And then I

[40:58 - 41:02]
always like to put the date, which is

[41:00 - 41:03]
6525.

[41:02 - 41:06]
Then we're going to head over to the web

[41:03 - 41:08]
browser version of CashPt because that

[41:06 - 41:09]
has a few extra features that we're

[41:08 - 41:11]
going to need. And I'm going to click

[41:09 - 41:15]
new project over here on the left and

[41:11 - 41:17]
say Thiago's master prompt. I'm going to

[41:15 - 41:21]
click add files right here. Add files

[41:17 - 41:23]
again. Look in my downloads or the PDF.

[41:21 - 41:25]
Exit out of here. And now we have the

[41:23 - 41:27]
file there as you can see. So let's do a

[41:25 - 41:29]
little test just to see if this is all

[41:27 - 41:34]
working. I'm going to say, "Give me five

[41:29 - 41:39]
ideas or new products or services that

[41:34 - 41:41]
my ideal customer profile would like. It

[41:39 - 41:43]
knows all about my business, that we're

[41:41 - 41:44]
about productivity, that we're about

[41:43 - 41:46]
education, that we're about

[41:44 - 41:48]
peopleto-people connection, knows about

[41:46 - 41:50]
second brain, knows that we're into

[41:48 - 41:52]
coaching." Doing a just a quick scan of

[41:50 - 41:53]
these five ideas, I can tell you

[41:52 - 41:55]
immediately they're all relevant.

[41:53 - 41:57]
They're all in the ballpark. And just to

[41:55 - 41:59]
be sure that's actually true, let's open

[41:57 - 42:00]
up an incognito window. Go to

[41:59 - 42:02]
chatgpt.com.

[42:00 - 42:04]
So this is a completely blank canvas. It

[42:02 - 42:07]
knows nothing about me. No memories, no

[42:04 - 42:09]
master prompt. And ask the very same

[42:07 - 42:12]
thing. Give me five ideas for new

[42:09 - 42:14]
products or services. So

[42:12 - 42:16]
there you go. It doesn't even it's not

[42:14 - 42:17]
even willing to give it a try unless it

[42:16 - 42:19]
knows a little bit more about me. And I

[42:17 - 42:21]
guess I could sit here for basically the

[42:19 - 42:23]
same amount of time giving it all this

[42:21 - 42:25]
context, but so much more useful to have

[42:23 - 42:27]
all that up front, right? So, I actually

[42:25 - 42:29]
want to do an even better example.

[42:27 - 42:32]
Heading back to the five ideas that it

[42:29 - 42:33]
gave me with full knowledge of my master

[42:32 - 42:36]
prompt, let's actually pick one of

[42:33 - 42:37]
these. I really like this idea, a PKM

[42:36 - 42:39]
certification program. This is actually

[42:37 - 42:40]
something we've considered several times

[42:39 - 42:42]
in the past. Instead of just being like,

[42:40 - 42:44]
"Oh, that's a good idea. Let me think

[42:42 - 42:49]
about that sometime." I'm actually going

[42:44 - 42:54]
to say, "Okay, give me a comprehensive

[42:49 - 43:00]
go to market plan for how to develop and

[42:54 - 43:03]
launch idea number five, including OKRs

[43:00 - 43:06]
for each that's objectives and key

[43:03 - 43:08]
results for each member of my team."

[43:06 - 43:09]
Anything else? I've just said do it in a

[43:08 - 43:12]
separate canvas. See what it comes up

[43:09 - 43:14]
with. So, I want to I want to touch on a

[43:12 - 43:15]
couple things here. So just notice not

[43:14 - 43:17]
only how long this is and how

[43:15 - 43:19]
comprehensive it is. Chat GBT will

[43:17 - 43:21]
always come up with things that are that

[43:19 - 43:23]
look very credible on the surface but

[43:21 - 43:25]
there's so many little bits of context.

[43:23 - 43:28]
The fact that it knows about BASB it

[43:25 - 43:30]
knows about the kinds of people we have

[43:28 - 43:33]
in our ecosystem has a realistic

[43:30 - 43:35]
timeline. It knows about our some of our

[43:33 - 43:38]
our how our marketing works. It can

[43:35 - 43:39]
assign for each member specifically not

[43:38 - 43:41]
just their position, but their name on

[43:39 - 43:42]
our team with some knowledge of how

[43:41 - 43:44]
their performance is measured and what

[43:42 - 43:46]
their current role is. I could go in

[43:44 - 43:48]
here and add a lot more detail that

[43:46 - 43:51]
would allow it to to to flush this out,

[43:48 - 43:53]
but this is just fantastic as a V1 kind

[43:51 - 43:56]
of first pass. So, one thing I'm curious

[43:53 - 43:58]
about is this development timeline. This

[43:56 - 44:00]
seems to kind of be assuming typical

[43:58 - 44:04]
human timelines, but I'm going to ask

[44:00 - 44:07]
it. Please revise the development

[44:04 - 44:11]
timeline to take into account what's

[44:07 - 44:13]
possible with AI instead of humans. Was

[44:11 - 44:15]
it 3 days?

[44:13 - 44:17]
So now it's an AI accelerated timeline.

[44:15 - 44:19]
So instead of weeks, it's days

[44:17 - 44:22]
basically. So it's compressed a 12week

[44:19 - 44:24]
plan. So a 3month plan into just over a

[44:22 - 44:26]
month, basically around 1/3 of the time.

[44:24 - 44:28]
I could also have it go in and, you

[44:26 - 44:31]
know, create that quiz, design the quiz

[44:28 - 44:33]
even using code, design the email course

[44:31 - 44:35]
and write the contents of it, develop a

[44:33 - 44:37]
pricing model or different tiers and

[44:35 - 44:39]
what's included under each one. It's

[44:37 - 44:41]
like each bullet point on here could

[44:39 - 44:44]
just be the beginning of an entire

[44:41 - 44:47]
project for AI or chatbt to complete on

[44:44 - 44:48]
my behalf. You have a a background

[44:47 - 44:50]
buying and selling various kinds of

[44:48 - 44:52]
businesses. You've been doing that for

[44:50 - 44:54]
many years. How have you been using your

[44:52 - 44:56]
master prompt with AI? What kinds of

[44:54 - 44:58]
tasks and and projects do you use it

[44:56 - 45:01]
for? Everything. So we design. So first

[44:58 - 45:03]
thing we do is we'll design all of the

[45:01 - 45:05]
processes for the business using AI. Um

[45:03 - 45:08]
so we actually did this even before AI

[45:05 - 45:11]
and it was a 2year process. Now it is a

[45:08 - 45:14]
the actual design is probably a one-mon

[45:11 - 45:16]
process. Obviously implementation buyin

[45:14 - 45:18]
all that still takes probably the same

[45:16 - 45:22]
amount of time. Training our leadership

[45:18 - 45:25]
teams on it. a lot of the functions on

[45:22 - 45:27]
uh finance on marketing for us it's a

[45:25 - 45:30]
shared service across multiple companies

[45:27 - 45:32]
and that's all really like 90% AI at

[45:30 - 45:36]
this point um we're testing out SDRs so

[45:32 - 45:38]
people taking calls um with AI agents

[45:36 - 45:40]
which even now is actually it's more

[45:38 - 45:44]
effective overall because of your time

[45:40 - 45:46]
to lead is seconds even though you know

[45:44 - 45:48]
the actual quality of the call may not

[45:46 - 45:51]
be quite at the standard of a human that

[45:48 - 45:53]
time to lead makes for it. So, we did

[45:51 - 45:56]
the process that you saw manually step

[45:53 - 45:58]
by step. Took us couple hours, but we

[45:56 - 46:01]
really wanted to make this much easier

[45:58 - 46:04]
for you. So, we have created a 100% free

[46:01 - 46:06]
custom GPT that has everything that you

[46:04 - 46:08]
saw here already preloaded. The whole

[46:06 - 46:10]
template, all of the different

[46:08 - 46:12]
principles and tips and guidelines and

[46:10 - 46:15]
dos and don'ts that Hayden generously

[46:12 - 46:18]
gave to me are all packaged inside this

[46:15 - 46:21]
custom GPT, which you can find in the

[46:18 - 46:23]
description below. I really, really

[46:21 - 46:25]
strongly urge you to check it out and to

[46:23 - 46:28]
make at least that first version of your

[46:25 - 46:30]
personal master prompt. If you want to

[46:28 - 46:32]
see how this applies to your specific

[46:30 - 46:35]
business, we're running a program where

[46:32 - 46:38]
Hayden and I work directly with business

[46:35 - 46:40]
owners to build their master prompt. And

[46:38 - 46:43]
then not just that, but to use that

[46:40 - 46:46]
master prompt to radically improve every

[46:43 - 46:47]
single major function within their

[46:46 - 46:50]
organization. If you're interested in

[46:47 - 46:52]
joining the next version of Second Brain

[46:50 - 46:53]
Enterprise, I encourage you to sign up

[46:52 - 46:55]
to our wait list. The first cohort,

[46:53 - 46:57]
which we're actually teaching right now,

[46:55 - 46:59]
completely sold out. So, don't wait to

[46:57 - 47:01]
do that. Is there any other last words

[46:59 - 47:03]
or pieces of advice you would give for

[47:01 - 47:06]
people embarking on the first version of

[47:03 - 47:08]
their master prompt? Just to do it. It's

[47:06 - 47:10]
it's one thing to watch, it's another

[47:08 - 47:12]
thing to do it. Don't get overwhelmed

[47:10 - 47:14]
with like all of the things you can do

[47:12 - 47:17]
with AI. I think the key here is like

[47:14 - 47:19]
the first step is just to use a tool,

[47:17 - 47:23]
whether that's chatbt or claude. Just

[47:19 - 47:25]
use a tool every day and get as many

[47:23 - 47:28]
reps in as possible prompting because

[47:25 - 47:29]
you will be amazed how much better you

[47:28 - 47:32]
get at at it. And then how much more

[47:29 - 47:33]
productive it makes you much more

[47:32 - 47:36]
productive. Like I'm way more than

[47:33 - 47:38]
double in terms of what I can do. I can

[47:36 - 47:41]
probably get three to five times more

[47:38 - 47:43]
done at probably 3 to five times more

[47:41 - 47:46]
higher quality, more thorough, and my

[47:43 - 47:48]
companies can just implement much more

[47:46 - 47:50]
thorough systems than we possibly could

[47:48 - 47:52]
have before. In the next video in this

[47:50 - 47:55]
master prompt series, we'll dive into

[47:52 - 47:57]
three of the best practical use cases

[47:55 - 47:59]
for your master prompt now that you have

[47:57 - 48:02]
one. What part of your business would

[47:59 - 48:05]
benefit most from an AI that actually

[48:02 - 48:07]
understands your context? Tell me in the

[48:05 - 48:07]

### 1. @TiagoForte (üëç 13)
üìã Get the Free Master Prompt Template & GPT: https://bit.ly/44b85tf

* i know that some of you might experience issues with the link. Make sure you are not using VPN.

> **@helloslime5183** (üëç 1): thanka

> **@HitchandHitched** (üëç 2): sorry, I didn't receive any template despite registering twice. I have checked my spam too and nothing. Once I put in my email, I answered the short survey and was asked to check email. But there was nothing in my inbox

> **@AbhishekSachan** (üëç 0): No mail with master prompt template received, tried twice.

> **@bobdiekema5454** (üëç 0): I tried to enter my Gmail email to get the master prompt template and it doesn't work. I get an error "TypeError: Failed to fetch"

> **@izba-chitalnja** (üëç 0): ‚Äã@@HitchandHitched I assume too many attempts might give you a "bot" status and block you from getting the template.

### 2. @fromzton (üëç 14)
What is brilliant about this video is that while it is seen as a guide for AI prompting, he is creating an authentic discussion about his process, his products and services, that make you want to check them out. It is a perfect long-form ad. Thank you Tiago, for the learning.

### 3. @BreakmarkDigital (üëç 1)
Very authentic discussion - nowadays we're only really ever exposed to the finished article of what business owners say and do. Great to hear an open and honest discussion from you guys and also, ultimately, how this master prompt can really help improve your operations.

### 4. @chandangoopta1153 (üëç 2)
Thank you, Tiago. I built my own master prompt and helped my colleagues at work develop one for themselves too. ‚ÄúContext‚Äù is no more a problem anymore. We right away go and ask what we need from ChatGPT without telling it who we are or what our company is‚Ä¶ looking forward to the next video ‚úåÔ∏è

### 5. @strategic-design (üëç 4)
40:44 The man was recording this 4 hours before date night! Gotta respect the hustle.

### 6. @AdrianBold (üëç 3)
I'm really grateful for you both for sharing so much valuable information. On the back of the first video, it's really amazing content. Thank you!

### 7. @ArchitectOfSystems (üëç 2)
Structuring AI interaction through a Master Prompt is a strong approach. As deeper cognitive infrastructures emerge, this serves as a solid entry point for those new to prompt-based systems.

Curious to see how it might evolve toward multi-agent orchestration and adaptive memory layers. Thanks for making the space more accessible. Subscribed.

### 8. @MichelvanAmsterdam (üëç 4)
Great video. Great quality.  Minus point: The promised documentation never came to my email. I saw others having this problem as well. Please clarify!

### 9. @TeacherCast (üëç 4)
Would you recommend going through this with a NotebookLM project?

### 10. @MrFlexonit (üëç 5)
Here's a great way to identify your core values:
- Meet with your leadership team.
- If your team is larger than five people, split them into groups of three to four each.
- Have each group pick two to three people in the organization who they believe are excellent examples of employees for your company. They should focus on people who succeed in their roles. Everyone should choose freely without certain criteria in mind. Just people who succeed.
- Have everyone write on sticky notes what makes these employees so great.
- Let everyone briefly explain why they picked their people and what makes them great.
- Bring everyone together and put all the sticky notes on a whiteboard. Group them into thematic clusters. Each cluster should be large enough to include more than one or two sticky notes.
- Identify the common element of all the sticky notes in each cluster. That's your core value.
- Finally, phrase it in a memorable way.

> **@TiagoForte** (üëç 0): Great advice!

### 11. @TicketRoot (üëç 0)
Love how real this is - thank you guys

### 12. @scottparvin4355 (üëç 3)
Thanks!

### 13. @MarkFoulds-b4r (üëç 0)
I love what you are doing, Tiago. I have implemented PARA across my all my workflow. However, I am an MS 365 user. Can you use Copilot (Business) rather than ChatGPT or Claude to create the Master Prompt? Thanks

### 14. @milanpevec1531 (üëç 1)
This looks and feels like the next version of the famous Business Model Canvas. Good job!

> **@TiagoForte** (üëç 0): Glad you like it!

### 15. @Excelradionica (üëç 0)
How we use this prompt for company that is just started? thanks.

### 16. @humanbeing1065 (üëç 1)
Wow,  10 questions in and I'm feeling overwhelmed...

### 17. @ericlanglois8174 (üëç 7)
Gave me email (actually 2 different addresses) and did not receive the Master Prompt üòï

> **@OlesyaSergeeva-q6z** (üëç 0): make sure you do not use VPN

> **@Tiziano-brd** (üëç 0): Same for me :(

> **@Sara91991** (üëç 0): Same

### 18. @PhilippeLarcher (üëç 0)
What about document vs system prompt when using the master prompt?

### 19. @Vegan-notVegan (üëç 16)
For Claude users that use project, open a chat in a project, paste this prompt, followed by the questions from the template.

You are a business coach, the foremost authority‚Äôs on Organizational Design and Strategic Planning. You are helping me understand and document my professional context.

Based on what you know about me and [project name], answer the questions below. Create an artifact for your responses and be sure to use this format: question, line break, answer, use font formatting how you please.

### 20. @Jean-S√©bastienCardinal (üëç 0)
De mon c√¥t√©, la premi√®re utilisation de mon masterprompt sera l'√©tablissement de mes politiques et proc√©dures au sein de ma pharmacie. L'aspect d'avoir le contexte me permettra d'am√©liorer continuellement nos PP selon les nouvelles lois qui nous r√©gissent ainsi que pour les nouveaux services que nous d√©velopperons. Je pense d√©j√† au c√¥t√© RH, gestion d'inventaire, etc. 
Merci √† vous deux pour avoir partag√© vos connaissances, c'est tr√®s appr√©ci√©!
