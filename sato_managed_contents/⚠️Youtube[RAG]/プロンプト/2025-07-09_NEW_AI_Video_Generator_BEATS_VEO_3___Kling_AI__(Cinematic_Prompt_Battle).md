[00:00 - 00:04]
Google 303 and Clink have officially

[00:02 - 00:06]
been dethroned at the top of the AI

[00:04 - 00:09]
video leaderboards. The new number one

[00:06 - 00:11]
is called Seance and it's from Bite

[00:09 - 00:13]
Dance, the company behind Tik Tok. And

[00:11 - 00:15]
get this, it's not just more powerful

[00:13 - 00:17]
it's one of the least censored models we

[00:15 - 00:19]
have ever seen. Due to YouTube

[00:17 - 00:21]
guidelines, I can't show everything

[00:19 - 00:23]
here, but model is pretty chill when it

[00:21 - 00:26]
comes to censorship. Its secret weapon

[00:23 - 00:28]
is multi-shot generation, letting you

[00:26 - 00:30]
create consistent characters across

[00:28 - 00:32]
multiple camera cuts, making real

[00:30 - 00:36]
cinematic scenes finally possible. So

[00:32 - 00:38]
today we are doing the ultimate mid2025

[00:36 - 00:40]
prompt battle. We are putting sea dance

[00:38 - 00:43]
head-to-head with all top AI video

[00:40 - 00:45]
generators to crown the true king of AI

[00:43 - 00:47]
video. Let's get started. The next

[00:45 - 00:50]
challenge is cinematic prompt battle.

[00:47 - 00:52]
Here I made the same pop fiction

[00:50 - 00:55]
inspired mini cinematic AI video in

[00:52 - 00:57]
every AI video generator. I run exact

[00:55 - 00:59]
same prompts for every single one of

[00:57 - 01:01]
them and I use runway references for

[00:59 - 01:03]
consistent character creation. Starting

[01:01 - 01:05]
with C dance, this supposed to be a

[01:03 - 01:07]
twist dance. Of course, it doesn't look

[01:05 - 01:10]
like that. The thing with sea dance is

[01:07 - 01:13]
the characters and motion looks quite

[01:10 - 01:15]
coherent. You don't see anatomical

[01:13 - 01:18]
errors or problems with face details

[01:15 - 01:21]
changing. One slight issue for sea dance

[01:18 - 01:23]
is we can say it's slightly less dynamic

[01:21 - 01:25]
in comparison to some of the other AI

[01:23 - 01:28]
video generators you will see in this

[01:25 - 01:30]
challenge. Next one is clink and from

[01:28 - 01:33]
the first sequence the coherence

[01:30 - 01:35]
problems of clink is really distracting.

[01:33 - 01:37]
It destroys the whole realism of the

[01:35 - 01:40]
scene. Faces change, the clothing change

[01:37 - 01:42]
and body parts frankly disappear and

[01:40 - 01:46]
reappear. It makes it difficult to use

[01:42 - 01:48]
it for this kind of dynamic scenes. some

[01:46 - 01:51]
motion looks completely off. Next one is

[01:48 - 01:53]
midjourney video. Midjourney video

[01:51 - 01:55]
sometimes surprises me because it makes

[01:53 - 01:57]
some aesthetic decisions that other AI

[01:55 - 01:59]
video generators don't do. So, I like

[01:57 - 02:02]
this quality of midjourney video. The

[01:59 - 02:05]
dance moves and rendering of joy and

[02:02 - 02:07]
emotion is super cool. Of course, it's

[02:05 - 02:10]
little behind of the other AI video

[02:07 - 02:12]
generators and sometimes it just doesn't

[02:10 - 02:14]
follow the prompt at all, but it's a

[02:12 - 02:16]
promising model. I also would like to

[02:14 - 02:19]
add that for mid journey video you have

[02:16 - 02:21]
two possible settings that you can use

[02:19 - 02:23]
motion high and motion low and I

[02:21 - 02:25]
experimented with both but for this

[02:23 - 02:29]
particular dance scenes I use motion

[02:25 - 02:32]
high to not limit model's capabilities

[02:29 - 02:34]
new model version two is one of the best

[02:32 - 02:36]
models when it comes to rendering some

[02:34 - 02:39]
physical activities like sports

[02:36 - 02:41]
activities and dance there's a fantastic

[02:39 - 02:43]
dynamic motion in these scenes and look

[02:41 - 02:46]
at the coherence throughout out the

[02:43 - 02:48]
shot. Their faces stay same. There's

[02:46 - 02:50]
absolutely minimum morphing both in the

[02:48 - 02:52]
faces and also in the clothes and we

[02:50 - 02:55]
lose coherence only when intensity of

[02:52 - 02:57]
action gets super fast and high. Then of

[02:55 - 03:00]
course you will spot some issues. But

[02:57 - 03:02]
this is a fantastic model and you can do

[03:00 - 03:04]
amazing cinematic work with Halo. For

[03:02 - 03:07]
this challenge, I have two winners. I

[03:04 - 03:09]
think both Cance and Hio did the best

[03:07 - 03:12]
job and this brings me to today's

[03:09 - 03:14]
sponsor. Finding the right soundtrack is

[03:12 - 03:16]
key to telling a compelling story

[03:14 - 03:19]
especially in my cinematic AI videos.

[03:16 - 03:21]
That's why I don't just use a service. I

[03:19 - 03:24]
have the best soundtracking partner. It

[03:21 - 03:26]
exists, Epidemic Sound. Their library is

[03:24 - 03:29]
massive. We are talking about 50,000

[03:26 - 03:31]
premium tracks and more than 200,000

[03:29 - 03:33]
sound effects. My absolute favorite

[03:31 - 03:36]
feature is create versions you can find

[03:33 - 03:38]
right here. With this, I can take any

[03:36 - 03:40]
song and easily trim it to the exact

[03:38 - 03:42]
length I need for a scene, which is

[03:40 - 03:45]
something I genuinely use all the time

[03:42 - 03:47]
in my final edits. You can simply choose

[03:45 - 03:50]
part of the track that you want to use.

[03:47 - 03:52]
You can choose your preferred length, 15

[03:50 - 03:54]
seconds, 45 seconds, and then it will

[03:52 - 03:57]
create perfect versions for this scene.

[03:54 - 03:59]
Also, you can upload an example video

[03:57 - 04:01]
and Epidemic Sant will analyze it and

[03:59 - 04:03]
find the suitable music for the scene.

[04:01 - 04:05]
I'm going to upload this shot with the

[04:03 - 04:07]
mermaid to Epidemic Sound and let's see

[04:05 - 04:09]
which recommendations it will make for

[04:07 - 04:11]
us. I hit get recommendations. Let's

[04:09 - 04:15]
listen to this one.

[04:11 - 04:15]
[Music]

[04:23 - 04:26]
Best of all, once you safelist your

[04:25 - 04:28]
channels, you will never have to worry

[04:26 - 04:30]
about copyright claims or monetization

[04:28 - 04:33]
issues. And because they are my partner

[04:48 - 04:52]
offer expires on August 10th, so don't

[04:50 - 04:55]
miss out. Starting with the first

[04:52 - 04:57]
challenge, our prompt is camera tilts

[04:55 - 05:00]
down to ankle level. A quick snap push

[04:57 - 05:03]
shows her boot kicks dust once in slow

[05:00 - 05:06]
motion. Starting with sea dance, the

[05:03 - 05:08]
initial tilt and push is actually here

[05:06 - 05:10]
but it's not actually a rapid fast push

[05:08 - 05:13]
that I would expect. And dust

[05:10 - 05:16]
interaction with the boat doesn't really

[05:13 - 05:18]
look realistic. Jumping into clink

[05:16 - 05:20]
camera tilt down is again here. And

[05:18 - 05:23]
again, we are struggling to see a snap

[05:20 - 05:26]
push here. However, dust interaction

[05:23 - 05:28]
with the boot looks much more realistic.

[05:26 - 05:30]
I really like the kick and how dust

[05:28 - 05:33]
spreads in the air. Looks much better

[05:30 - 05:35]
than sea dance. Jumping into midjourney

[05:33 - 05:37]
it looks quite cinematic with the camera

[05:35 - 05:40]
tilt down. And we have also camera

[05:37 - 05:42]
pushing in. It's not really rapid, but

[05:40 - 05:45]
there is definitely a camera push.

[05:42 - 05:47]
However, dust interaction is again very

[05:45 - 05:49]
subtle, very light. We don't really see

[05:47 - 05:52]
this kick. It's more like she's just

[05:49 - 05:54]
walking. On Halio's side, camera

[05:52 - 05:57]
dynamics are superb. So we have initial

[05:54 - 06:00]
tilt and pushing fast as requested.

[05:57 - 06:02]
However, the kick and dust interaction

[06:00 - 06:04]
looks a little bit funny. This is not

[06:02 - 06:07]
actually what we asked for. I actually

[06:04 - 06:09]
wanted a kick and a slow motion of dust

[06:07 - 06:13]
in the air. And we don't have output for

[06:09 - 06:15]
V3 because due to moderation, it was not

[06:13 - 06:18]
able to generate any output. So among

[06:15 - 06:20]
these four options, I think I like the

[06:18 - 06:22]
clink option the best. For me, it comes

[06:20 - 06:25]
closer to what I was imagining. That's

[06:22 - 06:28]
why clink is top. Next challenge. Camera

[06:25 - 06:30]
begins on a medium shot, then a rapid

[06:28 - 06:33]
smash zoom that lands on their lips just

[06:30 - 06:35]
as they kiss, then instantly shifts to

[06:33 - 06:37]
slow motion to linger on the delicate

[06:35 - 06:40]
motion of their lips. The sea dance

[06:37 - 06:42]
output gave us zoom, but it's not really

[06:40 - 06:45]
a quick and precise zoom as we ask in

[06:42 - 06:47]
the keywords of smash zoom. In the end

[06:45 - 06:49]
of the shot, there's this tongue action

[06:47 - 06:51]
which we definitely didn't ask for. So

[06:49 - 06:54]
that looks a little bit off. jumping

[06:51 - 06:57]
into Clink. Clink zoom was much quick

[06:54 - 06:58]
and precise. However, even though we

[06:57 - 07:01]
didn't ask for it, they just stopped

[06:58 - 07:03]
kissing. We supposed to see the kissing

[07:01 - 07:05]
throughout the shot and also the slow

[07:03 - 07:08]
motion. We specifically asked slow

[07:05 - 07:10]
motion segment to be staying in the

[07:08 - 07:14]
kissing action. So that's why clink

[07:10 - 07:17]
output was off. M3 output didn't give me

[07:14 - 07:18]
a quick and precise zoom. It actually

[07:17 - 07:21]
cut the scene and jumped into the

[07:18 - 07:23]
close-up which wasn't what I asked for.

[07:21 - 07:26]
Instead, what I needed was much more of

[07:23 - 07:28]
a continuous shot where I have just a

[07:26 - 07:30]
regular zoom in. But besides scene cut

[07:28 - 07:33]
it looks actually good. The lips action

[07:30 - 07:35]
kissing is clear and detailed during the

[07:33 - 07:38]
slow motion statement. Hydro shot

[07:35 - 07:40]
started with a very strong rapid quick

[07:38 - 07:43]
zoom landing on the lips and then it

[07:40 - 07:45]
perfectly switched to slow motion

[07:43 - 07:47]
exactly as we asked for where we linger

[07:45 - 07:50]
on the action of the kissing. It's a

[07:47 - 07:52]
very good shot and for me Hio is the

[07:50 - 07:54]
clear winner here and midjourney

[07:52 - 07:56]
moderation unfortunately didn't allow me

[07:54 - 07:59]
to generate this shot on midjourney

[07:56 - 08:01]
side. In the next shot, we have humans

[07:59 - 08:04]
shoot their arrows at the mammut and

[08:01 - 08:06]
then mammut strikes back with its tusks

[08:04 - 08:09]
while the camera circles around 270

[08:06 - 08:11]
degrees in the scene. Jumping into sea

[08:09 - 08:14]
dance, we see some problems with AI

[08:11 - 08:17]
logically staging the action. Instead of

[08:14 - 08:19]
arrows flying, we see this flamethrower

[08:17 - 08:22]
kind of thing coming from the spare.

[08:19 - 08:24]
Definitely not what we want. So, we have

[08:22 - 08:26]
some logical problems in the scene.

[08:24 - 08:29]
Besides that, circular motion is smooth.

[08:26 - 08:32]
I would say it covers a correct arc.

[08:29 - 08:34]
Maybe it's not precise 270°, but it's

[08:32 - 08:37]
acceptable. So, you will realize that

[08:34 - 08:39]
Mammoth's task goes through the human

[08:37 - 08:42]
which looks strange. The task just

[08:39 - 08:44]
penetrates through her. So, not the best

[08:42 - 08:46]
animation from my perspective. On the

[08:44 - 08:49]
cling side, we have some scene coherence

[08:46 - 08:52]
problems. We see that balls and arrows

[08:49 - 08:54]
disappearing. Humans are disappearing

[08:52 - 08:56]
and coming back again. The coherence is

[08:54 - 08:58]
completely off here. We definitely have

[08:56 - 09:01]
a circular motion, but rest of the shot

[08:58 - 09:04]
is not really usable. On V3 sides, we

[09:01 - 09:06]
see similar logical staging problems

[09:04 - 09:08]
throughout the shot. Humans are not

[09:06 - 09:10]
really shooting the arrows. This whole

[09:08 - 09:12]
thing doesn't really look like a fight

[09:10 - 09:14]
scene, but it looks much more like just

[09:12 - 09:17]
pausing in front of a mammoth with bows

[09:14 - 09:20]
and arrows. The midjourney gave us a

[09:17 - 09:22]
nice circular motion. The camera circles

[09:20 - 09:24]
the moment nicely. And humans again not

[09:22 - 09:26]
shooting the arrows. They are just

[09:24 - 09:28]
holding them. So this is not actually

[09:26 - 09:31]
what, we, asked, for., But, at least, camera

[09:28 - 09:33]
motion is here. And higher shot doesn't

[09:31 - 09:35]
really gave us the complex circular

[09:33 - 09:37]
motion. It looks more like a tracking

[09:35 - 09:39]
shot for me. And these balls and arrows

[09:37 - 09:42]
just looks like they are shooting like a

[09:39 - 09:44]
rifle from logical perspective. Totally

[09:42 - 09:46]
off. I think all the AI video generators

[09:44 - 09:48]
struggled with this particular

[09:46 - 09:51]
challenge. I think among all midjourney

[09:48 - 09:53]
video was the most usable one. Not the

[09:51 - 09:55]
perfect one but let's say most usable.

[09:53 - 09:56]
That's why midjourney video is the

[09:55 - 09:59]
winner here. In the next challenge

[09:56 - 10:01]
camera focused at three men and then

[09:59 - 10:04]
focus shifts to horizon and mountains

[10:01 - 10:06]
while sun is rising slowly. Here the key

[10:04 - 10:08]
challenge is the focus shift also known

[10:06 - 10:11]
as rack focus in cinematography. On

[10:08 - 10:13]
seance output video starts with the

[10:11 - 10:16]
three men in sharp focus which is cool.

[10:13 - 10:19]
After that we have a smooth transition.

[10:16 - 10:21]
Focus seamlessly change from man to

[10:19 - 10:23]
distant mountains which is exactly what

[10:21 - 10:26]
we asked for. Additionally it gave us

[10:23 - 10:28]
slow rising sun effect which looks

[10:26 - 10:31]
convincing and it creates the right

[10:28 - 10:33]
mood. So great job for sea dance here.

[10:31 - 10:36]
So clink gave us three man in focus at

[10:33 - 10:38]
the beginning and focus shift looked

[10:36 - 10:41]
much more dynamic in comparison to sea

[10:38 - 10:43]
dance. A camera tilt wasn't exactly what

[10:41 - 10:46]
I was imagining, but it's acceptable.

[10:43 - 10:48]
So, we can see the transition definitely

[10:46 - 10:51]
and slow rising sun effect is also here.

[10:48 - 10:53]
Jumping into view three side. Again, the

[10:51 - 10:56]
focus shift looks much more like a

[10:53 - 10:58]
camera push in or a dolly in shot. It's

[10:56 - 11:00]
not really a fixed camera transition.

[10:58 - 11:03]
Midjourney video output is similar to

[11:00 - 11:06]
V3. Again, we have a dynamic camera push

[11:03 - 11:08]
in. The transition is much more dynamic.

[11:06 - 11:11]
It's not really a rack focus as we

[11:08 - 11:13]
describe in cinematography because focus

[11:11 - 11:16]
shift and rack focus is much more subtle

[11:13 - 11:18]
and most of the time camera is static

[11:16 - 11:21]
and stable. The halio output is similar

[11:18 - 11:23]
to other options. We have a dynamic

[11:21 - 11:27]
transition of the focus from tree man to

[11:23 - 11:29]
the horizon and mountain and slow rising

[11:27 - 11:31]
sun effect is for me is a little bit

[11:29 - 11:34]
less convincing on Halio sides. It looks

[11:31 - 11:36]
a little bit more bold in comparison to

[11:34 - 11:39]
others. For this challenge, winner for

[11:36 - 11:41]
me is C dance because sea dance gave me

[11:39 - 11:44]
exactly what I was imagining with this

[11:41 - 11:46]
focus shift is much more subtle and

[11:44 - 11:48]
camera actually doesn't move but focus

[11:46 - 11:51]
changes which is exactly what I was

[11:48 - 11:53]
imagining. Our next prompt is fixed

[11:51 - 11:55]
camera and the mermaid starts swimming

[11:53 - 11:57]
towards the camera fast. Key challenge

[11:55 - 12:00]
here is of course the character

[11:57 - 12:02]
consistency and fluid motion in the

[12:00 - 12:03]
water environment. Starting with sea

[12:02 - 12:06]
dance, mermaid didn't really start

[12:03 - 12:08]
swimming towards the camera. It's more

[12:06 - 12:10]
like mermaid swims over the surface of

[12:08 - 12:13]
the water. This is not what we asked

[12:10 - 12:16]
for. The water physics splashes wakes

[12:13 - 12:18]
rendered perfectly. But since first part

[12:16 - 12:21]
of our prompt is not here, the shot is

[12:18 - 12:23]
not usable. Clink gave us exactly what

[12:21 - 12:25]
we asked for. We have the mermaid start

[12:23 - 12:27]
swimming towards the camera. Her

[12:25 - 12:29]
swimming motion is believable and

[12:27 - 12:31]
graceful. You can realize some

[12:29 - 12:33]
consistency problems with the face of

[12:31 - 12:36]
our mermaid. A slight morphing at the

[12:33 - 12:38]
beginning of the shot, but rest of it

[12:36 - 12:40]
it looks very good. Your tree completely

[12:38 - 12:43]
failed with character consistency here.

[12:40 - 12:46]
She's morphed and the whole body morphed

[12:43 - 12:48]
and changed. So, this shot is definitely

[12:46 - 12:51]
not usable. And Journey video decided to

[12:48 - 12:53]
turn our mermaid to a fish. The shot is

[12:51 - 12:55]
definitely not usable. We completely

[12:53 - 12:58]
lost consistency of our character. The

[12:55 - 13:02]
Hilio side gave us exactly what we asked

[12:58 - 13:04]
for. We have a mermaid maintaining

[13:02 - 13:06]
consistent appearance. She starts

[13:04 - 13:08]
swimming towards the camera. Motion is

[13:06 - 13:10]
believable and water physics rendered

[13:08 - 13:13]
perfectly. Here I'm definitely between

[13:10 - 13:15]
Clinky and Hio and I think they both

[13:13 - 13:18]
deserve to be a winners here. So this is

[13:15 - 13:19]
a tie. Both platforms did a great job

[13:18 - 13:21]
with this challenge. In the next

[13:19 - 13:24]
challenge, we have man and creature are

[13:21 - 13:27]
walking. Then camera smash zooms out

[13:24 - 13:29]
revealing the entire snowy scene in one

[13:27 - 13:32]
kinetic pull. Switching to wide shot.

[13:29 - 13:34]
Key challenge here is the dramatic smash

[13:32 - 13:37]
zoom out to a wide shot. Starting with

[13:34 - 13:40]
sea dance, it gave us what we asked for.

[13:37 - 13:42]
The pull out feels fast. Not the fastest

[13:40 - 13:45]
among all the results, but I think it

[13:42 - 13:47]
did a good job. The final shot present a

[13:45 - 13:49]
detailed and coherent snowy landscape.

[13:47 - 13:51]
So, I'm happy with that. And man and

[13:49 - 13:53]
creature retain their form during the

[13:51 - 13:55]
rapid zoom which is important. Only

[13:53 - 13:57]
problem here I can see that mana and

[13:55 - 13:59]
creature are not really walking

[13:57 - 14:02]
dynamically. It's a little bit more

[13:59 - 14:05]
static. The clink output definitely

[14:02 - 14:07]
feels a smash zoom out. It's definitely

[14:05 - 14:10]
extremely fast and it feels kinetic. The

[14:07 - 14:12]
final light shot presents some logical

[14:10 - 14:14]
errors like you can spot a car on the

[14:12 - 14:17]
left side which is weird. Even though

[14:14 - 14:19]
I'm happy with the camera motion, I have

[14:17 - 14:22]
problem with this logical error. Vio

[14:19 - 14:24]
three side gave us a nice dynamic

[14:22 - 14:27]
walking of man and the creature and then

[14:24 - 14:29]
decided to just jump cut to this wide

[14:27 - 14:32]
shot. Unfortunately, we don't have the

[14:29 - 14:34]
zoom out the kinetic extremely fast zoom

[14:32 - 14:36]
out that we asked for. That's why from

[14:34 - 14:39]
prompt adherence perspective we are tree

[14:36 - 14:41]
struggled. Midjourney video output is

[14:39 - 14:43]
really cool. The man and creature are

[14:41 - 14:45]
walking really naturally. I like that

[14:43 - 14:47]
the camera's zoom out feels less kinetic

[14:45 - 14:50]
than some of the other results, but I

[14:47 - 14:52]
think it's acceptable. I'm happy with

[14:50 - 14:55]
the midjourney video result did a good

[14:52 - 14:57]
job. But Halio output for me is the best

[14:55 - 15:00]
with this kinetic zoom out. It looks

[14:57 - 15:02]
very dramatic and extremely fast. The

[15:00 - 15:04]
final shot represents a very coherent

[15:02 - 15:06]
landscape. And in the most of the shot

[15:04 - 15:09]
men and creature retain their form.

[15:06 - 15:11]
Because of this job, Hio for me is the

[15:09 - 15:13]
winner for this challenge. I ask for a

[15:11 - 15:15]

[15:18 - 15:23]
In the next challenge, a flying goddess

[15:20 - 15:25]
attacks the man with a burning sword and

[15:23 - 15:27]
the man parries to defend himself. We

[15:25 - 15:29]
have an action choreography here and we

[15:27 - 15:32]
are looking for a believable interaction

[15:29 - 15:34]
between two characters. Looking at sea

[15:32 - 15:37]
dance, attack and defense sequence feel

[15:34 - 15:39]
dynamic. So, pacing is here. Vance Perry

[15:37 - 15:42]
convinces me when there's a contact with

[15:39 - 15:44]
the burning sword, it looks definitely

[15:42 - 15:47]
realistic in terms of materials clashing

[15:44 - 15:49]
between each other and burning effect on

[15:47 - 15:52]
the sword looks very realistic and

[15:49 - 15:54]
convincing. I like this output from

[15:52 - 15:56]
Cance. The clink output is an absolute

[15:54 - 15:59]
chaos. There is a massive coherence

[15:56 - 16:01]
problems for both of the characters and

[15:59 - 16:04]
this whole shot is absolutely unusable

[16:01 - 16:07]
from my perspective. V3 pacing of action

[16:04 - 16:09]
is off. So it decided to switch to slow

[16:07 - 16:11]
motion. And actually the flying goddess

[16:09 - 16:13]
is supposed to attack, not the man on

[16:11 - 16:15]
the ground, which is totally off from

[16:13 - 16:17]
prompt understanding perspective. With

[16:15 - 16:19]
midjourney video output, we see some

[16:17 - 16:21]
coherence problems, particularly around

[16:19 - 16:24]
the flying goddesses character. You can

[16:21 - 16:26]
also spot that hair of our character on

[16:24 - 16:28]
the ground, the knight's hair, looks

[16:26 - 16:30]
also very static, and the attack doesn't

[16:28 - 16:32]
really look convincing and realistic. It

[16:30 - 16:35]
looks more like she's just circling

[16:32 - 16:37]
around herself and highly output is just

[16:35 - 16:39]
because of some reason she decided to

[16:37 - 16:42]
leave the combat and just left it which

[16:39 - 16:45]
looks super funny and prompt adherence

[16:42 - 16:47]
is completely off and after she left in

[16:45 - 16:51]
a funny way he's just attacking to like

[16:47 - 16:54]
no one among all the outputs C dance did

[16:51 - 16:56]
the best job here and by far in the next

[16:54 - 16:59]
challenge we have a handheld shot and

[16:56 - 17:01]
she begins to spin and her voluminous

[16:59 - 17:03]
red cape below moving outwards and

[17:01 - 17:06]
camera follows her movement. Here it's

[17:03 - 17:07]
important to simulate the handheld shot

[17:06 - 17:09]
and we are really looking for a

[17:07 - 17:12]
realistic clothing physics. The sea

[17:09 - 17:14]
dance gave us a subtle and organic shake

[17:12 - 17:16]
to the camera mimicking the handheld

[17:14 - 17:19]
recording. We cannot really see red cape

[17:16 - 17:22]
below and flow realistically with the

[17:19 - 17:24]
spin. But there is no glitchy fabric or

[17:22 - 17:26]
things like that which is really nice.

[17:24 - 17:28]
And my character's face looks really

[17:26 - 17:31]
coherent. It's so good that you can see

[17:28 - 17:33]
this two dusty mark on her face remains

[17:31 - 17:35]
throughout the shot and it doesn't

[17:33 - 17:36]
change at all which is really

[17:35 - 17:39]
impressive. The clink output again

[17:36 - 17:41]
struggled with preserving the coherence

[17:39 - 17:44]
of our character. We lost coherence in

[17:41 - 17:47]
multiple zones particularly around face

[17:44 - 17:49]
and body. I like that red cape flow

[17:47 - 17:52]
realistically. Even though coherence

[17:49 - 17:54]
problems are here, it flows nicely with

[17:52 - 17:57]
the spin. Instead of handheld shot

[17:54 - 17:59]
though, we got a camera pullback which

[17:57 - 18:01]
was not what we asked for. V3 spin

[17:59 - 18:03]
doesn't really look realistic and

[18:01 - 18:06]
dynamic. It looks more like two parts

[18:03 - 18:08]
back and forth. I think handheld cameras

[18:06 - 18:11]
subtle and organic shake is here which

[18:08 - 18:13]
is good mimicking. But this strange spin

[18:11 - 18:16]
made things really complicated for me

[18:13 - 18:18]
with the V3. I like the midjourney video

[18:16 - 18:21]
output because it gave us exactly what

[18:18 - 18:23]
we asked for. A really nice voluminous

[18:21 - 18:25]
red cape. It flows realistically with

[18:23 - 18:27]
the spin which is cool. Only problem is

[18:25 - 18:30]
in the end of the shot you will realize

[18:27 - 18:32]
that cape becomes the part of her dress

[18:30 - 18:34]
which creates some coherence problems

[18:32 - 18:37]
but overall I think it's a cool shot and

[18:34 - 18:40]
Hio's shot the cape is a little bit too

[18:37 - 18:42]
much for me and it looks glitchy and not

[18:40 - 18:44]
really coherent. The color of original

[18:42 - 18:47]
cape is not really coherent with the

[18:44 - 18:49]
rest of the shot. For me among all sea

[18:47 - 18:51]
dance and midjourney shots are the most

[18:49 - 18:54]
usable and it comes closer to the prompt

[18:51 - 18:57]
I asked for. So they are both winners

[18:54 - 19:00]
here. Next prompt is she comes closer to

[18:57 - 19:03]
the dragon and touches him gently then

[19:00 - 19:05]
rapid smash zoom focuses on dragon's

[19:03 - 19:07]
eye. Key challenge here is a gentle

[19:05 - 19:09]
interaction followed by a rapid smash

[19:07 - 19:11]
zoom. Looking at the sea dance, there's

[19:09 - 19:13]
definitely a sense of gentleness in the

[19:11 - 19:16]
touch before the zoom. And then camera

[19:13 - 19:19]
slowly focus on dragon's eye, which is a

[19:16 - 19:21]
check mark. It's not a rapid zoom, but

[19:19 - 19:24]
something more soft. And dragon's

[19:21 - 19:26]
detailed expressive face looks just

[19:24 - 19:28]
fantastic. So, thumbs up for C dance

[19:26 - 19:30]
here. From prompt understanding

[19:28 - 19:33]
perspective, clink gave us everything as

[19:30 - 19:35]
well. Again, the clink zoom is also a

[19:33 - 19:37]
little bit more softer. It's not really

[19:35 - 19:40]
rapid. V3 gave us everything. we asked

[19:37 - 19:43]
for. We have a nice gentle touch and

[19:40 - 19:45]
it's followed by a rapid smash zoom.

[19:43 - 19:48]
Exactly what we asked for. Great output

[19:45 - 19:50]
from V3 on the highly output smash zoom

[19:48 - 19:52]
in is much more clear and this is

[19:50 - 19:55]
actually exact definition of smash zoom.

[19:52 - 19:57]
I think in terms of zoom precision and

[19:55 - 20:00]
how quickly and accurately does the

[19:57 - 20:02]
camera focus on dragon's eye, Hilio did

[20:00 - 20:05]
the best job. I was here between V3 and

[20:02 - 20:07]
Hio outputs and picked both of them as

[20:05 - 20:09]
winners for this challenge. In the next

[20:07 - 20:12]
challenge we have the gymnast takes two

[20:09 - 20:14]
quick preparatory steps along the beam

[20:12 - 20:16]
then launches into a dramatic split

[20:14 - 20:18]
leap. Her body hangs in the air for a

[20:16 - 20:22]
moment at the peak of the ark. Legs

[20:18 - 20:24]
extended in perfect 180° split. This is

[20:22 - 20:26]
a long prompt and is critical for

[20:24 - 20:28]
executing a precise and technical

[20:26 - 20:30]
sequence of a human motion. On the sea

[20:28 - 20:33]
dance output, we cannot really see the

[20:30 - 20:35]
consecutive actions, two steps, leap

[20:33 - 20:38]
peak, pause, and controlled landing. We

[20:35 - 20:40]
definitely can't see 180 degrees split.

[20:38 - 20:42]
At least, we, didn't, lose, coherence, in

[20:40 - 20:45]
this shot. And even though landing also

[20:42 - 20:47]
doesn't, look, so, stable,, at least, we, have

[20:45 - 20:51]
some anatomical realism. So this shot is

[20:47 - 20:52]
acceptable, but definitely not perfect.

[20:51 - 20:55]
So cling shot could have been really

[20:52 - 20:58]
cool even though two steps leap and peak

[20:55 - 21:02]
pose are not here. If coherence would

[20:58 - 21:04]
stay stable, this would be a nice shot.

[21:02 - 21:05]
But you can realize that at some point

[21:04 - 21:08]
she has like three legs and

[21:05 - 21:10]
unfortunately this shot is not usable.

[21:08 - 21:14]
Your tree output is absolute chaos.

[21:10 - 21:16]
Coherence is so bad and there is no

[21:14 - 21:18]
sequence accuracy, no anatomical

[21:16 - 21:21]
realism. The balance and control looks

[21:18 - 21:23]
off. The mid journey video output looks

[21:21 - 21:25]
really poetic. And actually just from

[21:23 - 21:28]
sequence accuracy perspective we have

[21:25 - 21:30]
two steps leap and peak pause only

[21:28 - 21:32]
problem is it looks like she's flying

[21:30 - 21:35]
and completely violating gravity and

[21:32 - 21:37]
physical rules and highly output is

[21:35 - 21:39]
again having lot of problems from

[21:37 - 21:42]
coherence perspective looking at all

[21:39 - 21:44]
seance and midjourney video did the best

[21:42 - 21:47]
but to be specific seance shot looks

[21:44 - 21:50]
much more realistic but me journey shot

[21:47 - 21:52]
looks accurate from sequence following

[21:50 - 21:54]
perspective I would choose both C dance

[21:52 - 21:56]
and midjourney video as winners. Next

[21:54 - 21:59]
challenge, we have a tiger mascot riding

[21:56 - 22:01]
a BMX bike at the Olympics and performs

[21:59 - 22:04]
a back flip while the camera circles

[22:01 - 22:07]
around him from the C dance output.

[22:04 - 22:09]
Tiger mascot riding a BMX looks very

[22:07 - 22:11]
successful and concept is here. So we

[22:09 - 22:14]
don't have backflip in this animation

[22:11 - 22:16]
which is a problem and camera motion is

[22:14 - 22:18]
also being ignored. It looks more like a

[22:16 - 22:21]
tracking shot. So C dance didn't do the

[22:18 - 22:24]
best job here. Clink output completely

[22:21 - 22:26]
went off with coherence again. In these

[22:24 - 22:28]
challenges, I run very often to the same

[22:26 - 22:31]
problem with clink. You're completely

[22:28 - 22:33]
losing your character's material look

[22:31 - 22:35]
and we can't find anything we ask for in

[22:33 - 22:38]
this shot. Camera work, action

[22:35 - 22:41]
animation, everything is off. V3 starts

[22:38 - 22:43]
the shot with flip or let's say multiple

[22:41 - 22:47]
flips to be exact. I think there are

[22:43 - 22:49]
like four or five back flips here. At

[22:47 - 22:51]
some point, Tiger and BMX bike morph

[22:49 - 22:54]
into each other and I would actually be

[22:51 - 22:57]
curious that how far this flipping would

[22:54 - 22:59]
go. Among all Mjourney video surprise me

[22:57 - 23:03]
the most because the whole shot looks

[22:59 - 23:05]
very accurate. At least this subtle 180°

[23:03 - 23:07]
flip looks believable and accurate. Even

[23:05 - 23:10]
though it's not a big flip, still

[23:07 - 23:13]
acceptable result considering other

[23:10 - 23:15]
results are quite bad. Frankly, that

[23:13 - 23:17]
camera work is not here. Again the high

[23:15 - 23:19]
started whole shot with the back flip

[23:17 - 23:21]
which is interesting. In the half of the

[23:19 - 23:23]
back flip we lost coherence but in the

[23:21 - 23:26]
end we found it. Again the camera work

[23:23 - 23:29]
is here. So there is like a subtle

[23:26 - 23:31]
circling action while keeping the tiger

[23:29 - 23:33]
centered which is important. I'm in

[23:31 - 23:35]
between midjourney output and hide your

[23:33 - 23:38]
output here. But because of elevated

[23:35 - 23:39]
coherence midjourney video is the winner

[23:38 - 23:42]
here. In the next prompt, we have a

[23:39 - 23:44]
scene instantly snapped into a dramatic

[23:42 - 23:46]
bullet time as a ceramic teacup

[23:44 - 23:48]
explodes. We have individual pieces of

[23:46 - 23:50]
the cup hang suspended, rotating

[23:48 - 23:52]
gracefully in the silent super slow

[23:50 - 23:54]
motion air. After a moment, action

[23:52 - 23:57]
crashes back to real time and the

[23:54 - 23:59]
fragments violently clatter and shatter

[23:57 - 24:01]
on the floor. Key challenge here is the

[23:59 - 24:03]
extreme sudden shift between real time

[24:01 - 24:06]
and super slow motion. Starting with sea

[24:03 - 24:07]
dance, the shot started with instant

[24:06 - 24:10]
bullet time. I was happy with the

[24:07 - 24:13]
individual pieces rotating around the

[24:10 - 24:15]
shot. And final crash back to real time.

[24:13 - 24:17]
It's quite violent, but because of

[24:15 - 24:19]
coherence problem, it's not really

[24:17 - 24:21]
convincing. If we wouldn't lose the

[24:19 - 24:24]
coherence in the end, it could have been

[24:21 - 24:26]
a good one. And then clink check mark

[24:24 - 24:28]
everything on our prompt except it

[24:26 - 24:30]
doesn't really look natural as I was

[24:28 - 24:32]
imagining. On the clink output

[24:30 - 24:35]
transitioning from slow motion to real

[24:32 - 24:37]
time is here. It's not so subtle, but

[24:35 - 24:40]
it's here. Of course, here. And there

[24:37 - 24:42]
you will spot some physics problems, but

[24:40 - 24:44]
overall it's an acceptable shot. On your

[24:42 - 24:46]
tree side, something strange happen. In

[24:44 - 24:49]
the middle of the shot, you will realize

[24:46 - 24:51]
that halfbroken cup becomes a full cup

[24:49 - 24:53]
again and then gets shattered again.

[24:51 - 24:55]
Typical coherence problems where you

[24:53 - 24:57]
observe with AI video tools. That wasn't

[24:55 - 25:00]
really a transition between slow motion

[24:57 - 25:02]
and real time. The whole shot feels like

[25:00 - 25:04]
super slow motion. Honestly, the

[25:02 - 25:06]
midjourney output started with instant

[25:04 - 25:10]
bullet time. Then in the end of the shot

[25:06 - 25:12]
it accelerated exactly as we asked for.

[25:10 - 25:14]
Looks so amazing and cinematic. Very

[25:12 - 25:17]
happy with this result. Hioite is

[25:14 - 25:19]
similar in most of the shot. It's stuck

[25:17 - 25:22]
in the super slow motion. And in the

[25:19 - 25:24]
very end in the last second we got the

[25:22 - 25:26]
realtime switch. There's a slight

[25:24 - 25:28]
coherence problem with the holder of the

[25:26 - 25:29]
cup that you can realize if you look

[25:28 - 25:32]
carefully. I think midjourney video is

[25:29 - 25:35]
the clear winner with great coherence

[25:32 - 25:37]
amazing temporal shift and physics of

[25:35 - 25:39]
shattering. Everything looks accurate

[25:37 - 25:42]
and great. And after evaluating all

[25:39 - 25:44]
outputs, final scoreboard looks like

[25:42 - 25:46]
this. But do you agree? Do you disagree

[25:44 - 25:48]
with some of my evaluations? Let me know

[25:46 - 25:51]
in the comment section and tell me which

[25:48 - 25:53]
one is your favorite AI video generator.

[25:51 - 25:54]

Great breakdown! Thank you. I mostly use Kling,  but may have to give Seedance a shot

Idk this to be 100% true, I just image each of these models have their own preferred way of prompting vs using the same prompt for each.

### 4. @leonardosahuburua (👍 2)
It is great, thanks. I believe that the algorithms require us to input the details as rigid as it should be so that it does not misinterpret what we meant. Anyway, thank you so much for bringing this up. Keep up the good works.

I used this EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY – DAY

A car cruises along the open stretch of sunbaked road. Dust kicks up behind the tires.

Up ahead: a large sandstone sign carved into the rock. Weather-worn, but proud.

> WELCOME TO VEIL
Pop. 150,000



The car slows. Window down. Clara leans her arm on the sill, sunglasses on, eyes taking in the familiar skyline in the distance.

Seedance flagged it more than once

The best is to use all of them with the best results they give and mix all their best result depending on the shot needed and to create the whole video.

### 7. @rudyflorestheswitchblade4462 (👍 2)
Midjourney with the 'Mermaid's Approach' turning her into a fish nearly gave me an asthma attack. Couldn't stop laughing. But I like this video, very informative.

### 8. @usmankhan-vm2wj (👍 4)
Great content ❤! Could you please create a video comparing the lip sync features of different platforms like KLING, Draeamina, and others? It would be really helpful if you could assign them different tasks like singing, playing guitar, or speaking, to see how well each platform performs in various scenarios.

### 9. @djmsr (👍 2)
Absolutely Seadance 💯 amazing. Done an amazing video using it lately purely recommended especially when it comes to human micro expressions

### 10. @GibranLahud (👍 1)
Nice video, man! We gotta check which one performs better and eliminate that saturated plasticized skin effect

### 11. @RamonRodgers (👍 7)
The moment Seedance and Hailuo 2.0 does good lip-sync, I'll switch.

> **@futurefuelcafe** (👍 2): Seedance already does good lip synching

> **@MrMagicmars** (👍 0): The best is Hedra for lips sync

### 12. @PolyWorkshop (👍 0)
Great video to compare these IA, thanks for the hard work! Do you use a specific software to load these IA and work with them locally?

### 13. @RobertsTechToolbox (👍 5)
I've been playing with Seedance 1.0 using Dreamina for access — crazy how smooth the camera work feels compared to VEO 3. It handled my Spider-Man in Tokyo prompt way better than expected. Excited to see where this goes in the next updates.

> **@Desi-AI-Beauty** (👍 0): But for me.... It feels seedance is quite lacking... I used Veo2 (not Veo3) and felt it to be better for image to video than seedance.

### 14. @anagnorisis2024 (👍 1)
You may want to add 'emotional facial expression on characters scene' in your future tests. This is probably one of the biggest drawbacks in consistent character + dramatic storytelling that most AI generators still struggle with.

### 15. @gastaoneto4236 (👍 2)
Dude, what a great video you made, it's great to see the differences between the AIs, congratulations. Thanks.

### 16. @nephewslim (👍 0)
Nothing can even be in the conversation for being the best AI program if it’s not producing sound. VEO 3 holds that crown for now.

### 17. @crash6871 (👍 1)
I got Hailuo for fun on a whim. Its been great. We are making all sorts of videos from our personal pictures. Lots of laughs.

I would love to try veo3 for the sound and i would love to compare Seedance to the one i already got. 

Cool stuff and sometimes scary real looking.

### 18. @illumediastudiofficial (👍 0)
nice video. Kling must improve the 2.1, since Hailuo rise the level right now. Just a quick consideration : if the shot is wrong, the output is going to be wrong. Don't forget to make the first frame perfect to have a chance to make a great video. The gymnasti,c for example, is a wrong first frame.

### 19. @bobaiese9891 (👍 0)
In my opinion, just as different actors would not deliver the same scene if they are reading the same script I tend to think that AI platforms would interpete the same prompts differently. Hence, if you prompted differently for each platform for each scene I would imagine the results would be different. It usually is the director (in this case - you)  that determines how an actor is doing and will prompt the actor to alter their results. It almost feels like it was luck that determined how your prompt would be interpreted not necessarily skill.

### 20. @wizards-themagicalconcert5048 (👍 0)
My first video of yours here but please tell me,how did u make all those different angles and cuts in Midjourney and keep the Characters the same ???Is that all done in Runway References ? I tried so many things in MJ and nothing works or looks like the way ur video does it ! Please make a tutorial if u haven't already !  Thanks and subbed !
