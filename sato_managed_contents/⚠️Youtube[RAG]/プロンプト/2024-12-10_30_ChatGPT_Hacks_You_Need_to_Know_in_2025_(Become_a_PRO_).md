[00:00 - 00:04]
in this video I'm going to share with

[00:01 - 00:07]
you 30 tips to make your experience with

[00:04 - 00:09]
Chad gbt better even if you've used Chad

[00:07 - 00:11]
gbt for some time you might not know

[00:09 - 00:14]
everything so fire up your Chad gbt and

[00:11 - 00:16]
follow along let's get right to it tip

[00:14 - 00:19]
number one break down your complex proms

[00:16 - 00:21]
into smaller chunks a lot of people

[00:19 - 00:24]
think hey I will just throw everything

[00:21 - 00:26]
at chadt and one go bad move when you

[00:24 - 00:27]
pack too much into one prompt you

[00:26 - 00:30]
usually end up with results that are

[00:27 - 00:32]
well all over the place chbc is good but

[00:30 - 00:35]
it's not a mind reader can get tangled

[00:32 - 00:37]
up in a Long messy prompt with too many

[00:35 - 00:39]
instructions at once so go step by step

[00:37 - 00:42]
start with one question or instruction

[00:39 - 00:43]
get a response make any tweaks you need

[00:42 - 00:46]
and then move on to the next step

[00:43 - 00:48]
building off what you just got yeah it

[00:46 - 00:50]
takes a bit more time but trust me the

[00:48 - 00:52]
results are so much better instead of

[00:50 - 00:54]
micromanaging every little mistake

[00:52 - 00:57]
you're getting smooth logical responses

[00:54 - 00:59]
that build naturally divide and conquer

[00:57 - 01:01]
all right number two coming in hot this

[00:59 - 01:04]
trick is like giving Chad gbt a job

[01:01 - 01:07]
title and a personality at the same time

[01:04 - 01:09]
just tell it to act like or imagine it's

[01:07 - 01:11]
someone specific and boom it shifts into

[01:09 - 01:14]
that role so let's say you need a

[01:11 - 01:16]
breakdown on ionic bonds instead of just

[01:14 - 01:19]
asking a generic question tell Chad gbt

[01:16 - 01:22]
imagine your chemistry teacher who was

[01:19 - 01:24]
nominated for a Nobel Prize and I'm your

[01:22 - 01:26]
student trying to understand ionic bonds

[01:24 - 01:29]
and now you're getting the next level

[01:26 - 01:31]
nerdy teacher vibe in the response this

[01:29 - 01:33]
work works for pretty much anything one

[01:31 - 01:36]
Chad gbt the thing like a marketing Pro

[01:33 - 01:39]
or maybe an event planner just ask it to

[01:36 - 01:42]
step into the raw and responses get way

[01:39 - 01:44]
more focused relevant and professional

[01:42 - 01:47]
you've got a mini Army of experts ready

[01:44 - 01:50]
to go so use it tip number three here we

[01:47 - 01:52]
go be sure to rename your chats for

[01:50 - 01:54]
better organization if you're using chat

[01:52 - 01:56]
gbt regularly your chat history probably

[01:54 - 01:59]
looks like a hot mess we've all been

[01:56 - 02:01]
there renaming keeps things organized so

[01:59 - 02:04]
you know which hats are golden and which

[02:01 - 02:06]
ones were just quick throwaways click on

[02:04 - 02:08]
that little rename button type in

[02:06 - 02:10]
something that actually describes the

[02:08 - 02:13]
combo and you're set and hey don't be

[02:10 - 02:15]
afraid to delete the all chats keep

[02:13 - 02:17]
things tidy and honestly you will find

[02:15 - 02:21]
what you need a lot faster let's move on

[02:17 - 02:23]
to tip number four use natural language

[02:21 - 02:26]
gone are the days when you had to talk

[02:23 - 02:28]
to Chad gbt like you are programming a

[02:26 - 02:31]
robot these days just typee like you're

[02:28 - 02:34]
talking to a person no more funky prom

[02:31 - 02:36]
structures or keywords just say what you

[02:34 - 02:38]
need like you're asking a friend one

[02:36 - 02:40]
Chad to write a summary or explain

[02:38 - 02:42]
something just say it how you would

[02:40 - 02:45]
normally and it will pick up on your

[02:42 - 02:47]
Vibe one thing to remember though be

[02:45 - 02:49]
descriptive the more detail you give the

[02:47 - 02:51]
better the response if you've good

[02:49 - 02:53]
specific requirements don't hold back

[02:51 - 02:56]
and if chat's answer needs a bit of

[02:53 - 02:59]
tweaking just say directly hey can you

[02:56 - 03:00]
make this simpler or add more examples

[02:59 - 03:03]
super straight forward when we first

[03:00 - 03:05]
started using Chad gbt in my YouTube

[03:03 - 03:08]
agency was a bit of a pain we had a

[03:05 - 03:10]
whole system of prompts with tons of

[03:08 - 03:13]
variations wasn't pretty let me tell you

[03:10 - 03:15]
but now we istill it all to just 10 15

[03:13 - 03:18]
prompts that cover all our needs and all

[03:15 - 03:20]
those new prompts are written in natural

[03:18 - 03:22]
language and for number five use

[03:20 - 03:25]
temporary chats click here and enable

[03:22 - 03:27]
temporary chat think of this like

[03:25 - 03:29]
incognito mode for Chad gbt when you

[03:27 - 03:32]
start a temporary chat anything you say

[03:29 - 03:34]
in there isn't safe to chat gbt's memory

[03:32 - 03:36]
and it won't affect future responses

[03:34 - 03:38]
it's ideal for when you are handling

[03:36 - 03:40]
sensitive info where just don't want the

[03:38 - 03:42]
chat sticking around but this isn't for

[03:40 - 03:45]
anything sketchy it's more for say

[03:42 - 03:47]
brainstorming ideas or confidential

[03:45 - 03:49]
project or discussing personal matters

[03:47 - 03:51]
and when you're done just close it out

[03:49 - 03:53]
and you're back to normal easy and

[03:51 - 03:55]
private all right halfway to 10 tip

[03:53 - 03:58]
number six turn on custom instructions

[03:55 - 04:00]
click here settings personalization

[03:58 - 04:02]
click on custom instruction and now

[04:00 - 04:04]
you've got two fields to fill out the

[04:02 - 04:06]
first is all about you this is where you

[04:04 - 04:09]
can add context about your background

[04:06 - 04:12]
preferences or specific needs it's like

[04:09 - 04:14]
said in the stage so chbc knows exactly

[04:12 - 04:16]
what you are about right off the bed

[04:14 - 04:18]
just remember no sensitive info like

[04:16 - 04:21]
credit card numbers keep it relevant

[04:18 - 04:22]
like your writing style or what kind of

[04:21 - 04:25]
help you're looking for and then there's

[04:22 - 04:27]
the second field actual instructions for

[04:25 - 04:29]
how Chad gbt should behave so here you

[04:27 - 04:32]
can specify anything how you want

[04:29 - 04:34]
responses structured particular tone

[04:32 - 04:36]
even how Chad gbt should handle certain

[04:34 - 04:38]
types of questions if you need a deep

[04:36 - 04:40]
dive into custom instructions check out

[04:38 - 04:42]
our fall guide 30 minutes of everything

[04:40 - 04:45]
you need to know number seven is a good

[04:42 - 04:48]
one clear Chad gbt's memory if Chad gbt

[04:45 - 04:50]
responses are getting a bit weird or off

[04:48 - 04:52]
track it might be because there is too

[04:50 - 04:54]
much clutter in its memory over time

[04:52 - 04:56]
Chad gbt can start collecting

[04:54 - 04:59]
conflicting info which messes with its

[04:56 - 05:01]
ability to respond accurately so from

[04:59 - 05:03]
time to time you should go into settings

[05:01 - 05:05]
personalization click on clear chat

[05:03 - 05:07]
gbt's memory then this once a month

[05:05 - 05:10]
keeps responses consistent and avoids

[05:07 - 05:12]
any memory overload weirdness you often

[05:10 - 05:14]
ask me where are all the TOs you talk

[05:12 - 05:17]
about look I have a website where we

[05:14 - 05:19]
post our reviews of most TOS we test all

[05:17 - 05:22]
TOS are handpicked and hand tested so

[05:19 - 05:24]
all reviews are on point I will leave a

[05:22 - 05:26]
link in the description for you tip

[05:24 - 05:29]
number eight pick a voice that you like

[05:26 - 05:31]
Chad gbt can actually respond verbally

[05:29 - 05:33]
and narrate responses but not everyone

[05:31 - 05:35]
wants to use the default voice to make

[05:33 - 05:38]
your experience a bit more personal go

[05:35 - 05:40]
to speech and settings and pick another

[05:38 - 05:42]
voice there's a range of voices each

[05:40 - 05:44]
with a different tone and style so you

[05:42 - 05:47]
can find one that feels a bit more like

[05:44 - 05:49]
your Chad gbt it's a small change that

[05:47 - 05:51]
can make a big difference if you're

[05:49 - 05:53]
using it a lot coming in at number nine

[05:51 - 05:54]
if you work with sensitive or

[05:53 - 05:57]
confidential data all the time but want

[05:54 - 05:59]
your chats to remain active turn off

[05:57 - 06:01]
improve for everyone in settings head

[05:59 - 06:03]
over to to data controls improve the

[06:01 - 06:05]
model for everyone switching this off

[06:03 - 06:07]
keeps your chat store locally in your

[06:05 - 06:09]
account so you can pick up right where

[06:07 - 06:11]
you left off the key here is that your

[06:09 - 06:14]
info stays private nothing gets shared

[06:11 - 06:15]
back to open AIS model training perfect

[06:14 - 06:17]
if you're working on confidential

[06:15 - 06:19]
projects but still want all the

[06:17 - 06:22]
convenience of safe chats let's hit

[06:19 - 06:24]
double digits with tip 10 connect your

[06:22 - 06:27]
Google drive or one drive so had gbt can

[06:24 - 06:29]
pull directly from your files just go to

[06:27 - 06:31]
settings then connected apps and log

[06:29 - 06:32]
into your account when prompted here's a

[06:31 - 06:35]
quick tip to keep things smooth give

[06:32 - 06:37]
your files clear descriptive names and

[06:35 - 06:40]
organize them in folders with labels

[06:37 - 06:42]
that make sense that way when Chad gbt

[06:40 - 06:44]
pulls a file it knows exactly what it's

[06:42 - 06:46]
working with the workflow in my YouTube

[06:44 - 06:49]
agency set up in such a way that the

[06:46 - 06:50]
only app we've connected is Google Drive

[06:49 - 06:53]
where all our scripts and video files

[06:50 - 06:55]
are this way while writing scripts or

[06:53 - 06:57]
just brainstorming we don't have to

[06:55 - 06:59]
check stuff manually Chad gbt does it

[06:57 - 07:03]
for us in a second saves us a ton of

[06:59 - 07:05]
time 11 turn on all capabilities chbt

[07:03 - 07:07]
can do lots of things so to take full

[07:05 - 07:09]
advantage of its capabilities be sure to

[07:07 - 07:12]
turn on all of its features click on

[07:09 - 07:13]
customize Chad gbt and Below custom

[07:12 - 07:16]
instructions you should see a few

[07:13 - 07:18]
toggles turn on browsing to give Chad

[07:16 - 07:21]
gbt internet access Dolly to be able to

[07:18 - 07:23]
generate images and code to make it a

[07:21 - 07:25]
programmer without these you're really

[07:23 - 07:27]
only tapping into the right in assistant

[07:25 - 07:29]
side which is cool but way less powerful

[07:27 - 07:30]
than what Chad gbt can do oh and don't

[07:29 - 07:32]
for don't forget to leave enable for new

[07:30 - 07:35]
chats turned on so you don't have to

[07:32 - 07:38]
redo settings every single time number

[07:35 - 07:40]
12 be sure to set up formatting rules

[07:38 - 07:42]
Chad gbt can format responses in all

[07:40 - 07:44]
sorts of ways but sometimes it just

[07:42 - 07:46]
doesn't quite hit the mark so here's the

[07:44 - 07:48]
move each time you prompt specify

[07:46 - 07:51]
exactly how you want it formatted need a

[07:48 - 07:54]
stepbystep guide ask for it want an

[07:51 - 07:57]
essay or a bullet list spell it out you

[07:54 - 07:59]
can go as detailed as you want lists

[07:57 - 08:01]
tables paragraphs whatever suits the the

[07:59 - 08:03]
task this little tweak saves you from

[08:01 - 08:06]
getting responses that feel off track or

[08:03 - 08:08]
mismatched with what you need lucky

[08:06 - 08:10]
number 13 coming up ask Chad gbt to

[08:08 - 08:12]
explain something to 10year Old this

[08:10 - 08:15]
one's a personal favorite because keeps

[08:12 - 08:17]
stay simple clear and to the point if

[08:15 - 08:19]
you're struggling with a complex topic

[08:17 - 08:23]
just tell chbt to explain it to a

[08:19 - 08:24]
10-year-old works for everything from

[08:23 - 08:26]
understanding tricky theories to

[08:24 - 08:29]
breaking down data analysis and if you

[08:26 - 08:31]
really wanted simplified switch 10 year

[08:29 - 08:34]
old 5-year-old and enjoy the ultimate

[08:31 - 08:36]
crash course in Simplicity perfect for

[08:34 - 08:38]

[08:36 - 08:40]
without the fluff tip 14 customize the

[08:38 - 08:42]
appearance everyone's chat gbt setup

[08:40 - 08:44]
looks the same by default you've got a

[08:42 - 08:48]
few customization options head over to

[08:44 - 08:50]
settings then General and pick your Vibe

[08:48 - 08:52]
light or dark mode dark mode can be

[08:50 - 08:54]
easier on the ice especially if you are

[08:52 - 08:56]
a night l or coder set it to automatic

[08:54 - 08:59]
if you wanted to syn with your system

[08:56 - 09:02]
settings halfway there with number 15

[08:59 - 09:04]
provide Chad gbt with context Chad gbt

[09:02 - 09:07]
doesn't know anything about you your

[09:04 - 09:08]
project or your needs unless you tell it

[09:07 - 09:10]
so give it some background the more

[09:08 - 09:12]
relevant info the better if you're say a

[09:10 - 09:14]
college student with a specific

[09:12 - 09:17]
assignment just add those details up

[09:14 - 09:20]
front like um I am a college senior with

[09:17 - 09:22]
a 3.5 GBA and I need an essay outline in

[09:20 - 09:25]
the French revolutions impact and boom

[09:22 - 09:28]
chadt has the context it needs to tailor

[09:25 - 09:30]
response that actually fits don't worry

[09:28 - 09:32]
this won't mess with formatting or style

[09:30 - 09:35]
it just makes the response more relevant

[09:32 - 09:37]
rolling in with tip 16 for those of you

[09:35 - 09:40]

[11:47 - 11:51]
get a subscription most people stick

[11:49 - 11:53]
with a free version of Chad gbt but

[11:51 - 11:55]
there are some big limitations there for

[11:53 - 11:57]
solds the free plan only gives you

[11:55 - 12:00]
limited access to gbt 4L and after a few

[11:57 - 12:02]
proms can drop you down to the 40 mini

[12:00 - 12:04]
and believe me the difference is massive

[12:02 - 12:06]
GPT 40 is like the big leagues while 40

[12:04 - 12:08]
mini is more like little league it's

[12:06 - 12:10]
less precise repeats itself more and

[12:08 - 12:13]
just doesn't have that same punch in

[12:10 - 12:15]
responses plus the free version caps you

[12:13 - 12:17]
at two images per day and limits the

[12:15 - 12:19]
number you can upload for analysis but

[12:17 - 12:22]
for $20 a month you unlock the full

[12:19 - 12:25]
power of gbt 4L get unlimited image

[12:22 - 12:27]
generation analysis and a whole lot more

to really maximize Chad gbt the

[12:27 - 12:31]
subscription is where it's at moving on

[12:29 - 12:33]
to to 18 use the correct model many

[12:31 - 12:35]
people look at the list of models and

[12:33 - 12:38]
think the 40 is some sort of a

[12:35 - 12:39]
downgraded version of the gbg4 so they

[12:38 - 12:42]
switch to it and eventually get

[12:39 - 12:45]
frustrated with the results the GBC 4 is

[12:42 - 12:47]
undoubtedly very capable but 40 is

[12:45 - 12:50]
better in any way it's more efficient

[12:47 - 12:52]
uses fewer tokens and gives faster more

[12:50 - 12:55]
accurate answers it's just better so

[12:52 - 12:57]
please don't even think about switching

[12:55 - 13:00]
to gbt 4 stick with the four row if you

[12:57 - 13:02]
want to explore Aon and try something

there to help troublesho need your code

[15:13 - 15:18]

[15:18 - 15:24]
and lcks throughout the code making

[15:20 - 15:26]
organized and readable number 20 use gb1

[15:24 - 15:29]
for advanced reasoning this model is

[15:26 - 15:31]

trip up the standard 40 anything

[15:31 - 15:38]
educational that you can do with gbt 40

level providing stepbystep breakdowns

[15:49 - 15:53]
pseudo code for programming Solutions

[15:51 - 15:56]
and even referencing the resources used

to arrive at an answer the 01 model is a

[15:56 - 16:01]

offering in-depth explanations and

[16:03 - 16:07]
mathematical proofs with clear reasoning

for each step it takes it's also

[16:07 - 16:12]
fantastic at handling multi-layered

organized and on topic so it's a dream

[16:14 - 16:18]
for students and professionals who need

[16:16 - 16:21]
deep insights the only catch is that

[16:18 - 16:24]
it's a little slower taking more time to

[16:21 - 16:27]
process due to the depth of analysis so

[16:24 - 16:29]
for everyday tasks gbt 40 is still the

[16:27 - 16:32]
way to go but when you're working on

[16:29 - 16:35]
complex detailed challenges gb1 is the

[16:32 - 16:37]
model you want trick 21 is a very simple

[16:35 - 16:39]
one create a document with all

successful prompts you've probably built

[16:39 - 16:42]
up a solid collection of effective

[16:40 - 16:44]
prompts by now but let's face it trying

[16:42 - 16:47]
to remember them all every time as a

[16:44 - 16:49]
pain solutions so start a document

[16:47 - 16:51]
whether in Google Docs notion or even a

[16:49 - 16:53]
simple notes app and copy over any prom

[16:51 - 16:56]
that works well this way you've got them

[16:53 - 16:58]
saved and ready to go no tweaking or

[16:56 - 17:00]
guessing required it's a huge timesaver

[16:58 - 17:03]
and you will get top results every time

[17:00 - 17:05]
tip number 22 you're ready ask Chad gbt

[17:03 - 17:08]
to do things step by step when you ask

[17:05 - 17:11]
Chad gbt to work through task step by

[17:08 - 17:13]
step the results often turn out clearer

[17:11 - 17:16]
and more logical this method encourages

[17:13 - 17:18]
Chad gbt to rely on reasoning instead of

[17:16 - 17:21]
just pulling from memory most of the

[17:18 - 17:23]
time Chad gbt will format responses step

[17:21 - 17:25]
by step if it makes sense but adding

[17:23 - 17:27]
this instruction directly doesn't hurt

[17:25 - 17:29]
and if you're asking for a guide like

[17:27 - 17:32]
recipe throw in all the details you want

[17:29 - 17:34]

has specific example to follow without

[17:46 - 17:51]
guidance responses can feel generic or

[17:49 - 17:54]
AI like so if you have a structure or

[17:51 - 17:56]
style in mind just include an example in

[17:54 - 17:59]
your prompt say you need 10 email

[17:56 - 18:01]

You can also adds emojis while naming your chats. Much easier to find the one you need if you like visuals.

1st tip is very useful. i used to write a big paragraph telling gpt what i want but it didnt give proper result, then i told gpt small stuff and made changes to it later, works much better now.

> **@AnnaMcCleery** (👍 2): Wow, that  sounds pretty crappy. I can throw a whole novel at Claude and he will not neglect even a  comma. ChatGPT sounds like he's in the remedial class perhaps?

About ChatGPT Memory: I would suggest using the Manage option to review memories and select which to delete or keep. Some are useful, even if others not so much, so best not to just clear them all.

> **@rasserfrasser** (👍 6): thank you, I was about to comment on this as well. It took me half the night to train GPT how to layout graphs clean and simple the same way every time (and to stop putting them in scrollable windows!) there's no way I'm deleting that set of definitions.

> **@Radiance230** (👍 1): Thank you! I didn’t know this

> **@itorres008** (👍 2): Additionally... Sometimes GPT will show message Saving Memory (or Memory Saved), some other times it will ask "Save Memory?".
I infer that the memory area is full and GPT is asking because it will erase something to make room. So, at that point before saying Yes. it would be good to Manage Memory and make room by deleting what you feel is less important. Also, one could copy all memory content and save it somewhere just in case.

> **@michellekoch5245** (👍 9): I recently had ChatGPT tell me what it remembered, and then asked it to clean it up and streamline to remove duplications and contradictions. It made a suggested list, I made a couple of tweaks and then asked it to delete memory and replace it with the new list. Super helpful.

#8 changing the voice, you can ask ChatGPT to change their voice with prompts, such as I’d like you to be a Somalian assistant that a English speaker can understand, it’ll try its best and you can tweak whatever parameters you can think of and it will actually change the tone or whatever. I made mine actually sound like a British person that cusses when he’s fed up with me 😂

love the video, great help! i have a question tho, why the constant "looking away"? its like youre talking to someone else and not the viewer

### 8. @K4t4ck (👍 4)
After watching this I noticed I’m using most of them! Thanks for the video!

### 9. @62_stratocaster (👍 4)
Please make a video on AI uses (and which site (ChatGPT, Magic Quill, etc.) to use) for a regular guy that's not interested in coding, business, etc. More home user stuff like the better sites or apps for photo editing, audio manipulation (removing voice from a song, etc.), simple video editing, file manipulation (encrypting, etc. - naturally this would have to be done locally.), and many other "home uses." Thank you.

Thank you for this video. So informative. Really love GPT but also hope it can be a little bit cheaper, lol.

use this prompt repeatedly to have gen AI teach you prompt engineering. you're welcome. 

"Create a 5-minute advanced tutorial in prompt engineering tailored for someone with extensive experience in the field. The tutorial should: 1. Introduce a specific, lesser-known advanced technique or principle in prompt engineering. 2. Provide practical examples of the technique in action, explaining how to refine or debug prompts for maximum effectiveness. 3. Highlight strategies for iterating prompts to generate nuanced, innovative, and contextually aware results. 4. Include an actionable exercise or challenge the learner can immediately try to internalize the lesson, with tips on how to evaluate their outputs. 5. Conclude with a reflection on how the technique can elevate their prompt engineering skills to a world-class level. 6. End with a pro-tip based on this lesson. Ensure the tutorial is engaging, with a focus on exploring the finer points of prompt crafting, and avoid repeating the same content when this prompt is run multiple times. Vary the topics, examples, and exercises with each iteration while maintaining the advanced nature of the lesson. Use clear, concise, and professional language aimed at an expert audience."

Namaste:

Query on point No. 1 (Break Down complex prompts)

I observe that if we break ChatGPT into multiple prompts , it tends to become more centralized towards the last query while still incorporating previous prompts.

> **@verbalventure** (👍 0): I notice that too.
