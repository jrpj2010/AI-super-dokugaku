## Â≠óÂπï

[00:00 - 00:02]
So, from last few times, I have seen that people are

[00:02 - 00:04]
talking about Prompt Engineering.

[00:04 - 00:06]
In the month of May, we had launched a course on Prompt

[00:06 - 00:07]
Engineering.

[00:07 - 00:09]
People liked it a lot.

[00:09 - 00:11]
Now, I feel that the world has moved ahead of Prompt

[00:11 - 00:12]
Engineering.

[00:12 - 00:14]
The world is moving towards GPT.

[00:14 - 00:17]
So, I feel that Prompt Engineering is a basic skill which

[00:17 - 00:19]
everyone should have.

[00:19 - 00:22]
So, we are completely freeing that course for you all.

[00:22 - 00:25]
So, if you want to pay fees, you can pay fees through the

[00:25 - 00:26]
link given below.

[00:26 - 00:27]
Rest, there is no need.

[00:27 - 00:29]
If you don't have money, then there is no need.

[00:29 - 00:31]
Enjoy it.

[00:31 - 00:34]
And those who had purchased our course on Prompt

[00:34 - 00:35]
Engineering, don't worry.

[00:35 - 00:38]
There will be more videos for you.

[00:38 - 00:42]
I am practicing on making GPT and monetizing GPT.

[00:42 - 00:45]
As time goes by, you will get access to it.

[00:45 - 00:48]
So, if you haven't purchased the course, you can purchase

[00:48 - 00:49]
it.

[00:49 - 00:50]
The link is given in the description below.

[00:50 - 00:53]
Let's assume that we have freed 80% of the course on

[00:53 - 00:54]
YouTube.

[00:54 - 00:55]
Hi, guys. My name is Sahil Khanna.

[00:55 - 00:58]
I run a digital marketing company named Lapaas.

[00:58 - 01:01]
For the last 12-13 years, and for the last 5-6 years,

[01:01 - 01:03]
I have been doing prompting.

[01:03 - 01:06]
We use prompting in our work.

[01:06 - 01:10]
To create digital marketing ads, to create landing pages.

[01:10 - 01:13]
So, in this course, I am going to teach you how you can

[01:13 - 01:15]
become a prompting expert.

[01:15 - 01:17]
I have covered many frameworks.

[01:17 - 01:22]
I have told you the way how you can ask questions from any

[01:22 - 01:24]
board and get answers from it.

[01:24 - 01:27]
So, first of all, let's understand what is a large language

[01:27 - 01:27]
model?

[01:27 - 01:31]
Large language model means we have given a lot of knowledge

[01:31 - 01:33]
to the computer.

[01:33 - 01:34]
This thing is this.

[01:34 - 01:35]
This thing is this.

[01:35 - 01:36]
This thing is this.

[01:36 - 01:38]
Now, the computer has got so much knowledge, so you can ask

[01:38 - 01:41]
anything from the computer and get the answer.

[01:41 - 01:43]
You can understand it as a kind of Google.

[01:43 - 01:44]
Google knows a lot.

[01:44 - 01:46]
You search on Google, you get a lot of results.

[01:47 - 01:49]
But if we talk about Google, it shows you the results of

[01:49 - 01:50]
the website.

[01:50 - 01:53]
But the cool thing about the large language model is that

[01:53 - 01:56]
it gives you the answer directly to your question. Just

[01:56 - 01:59]
like how there's an art to searching on Google, there's

[01:59 - 02:02]
also an art to getting the most out of the large language

[02:02 - 02:03]
model.

[02:03 - 02:06]
Now, if we want to get an answer from any large language

[02:06 - 02:08]
model, we have to ask the right question.

[02:08 - 02:11]
If our question is from here to there, it knows a lot.

[02:11 - 02:13]
It can give the answer to anything.

[02:13 - 02:16]
So, prompting makes these things easy so that you can get

[02:16 - 02:19]
the best results from the large language model.

[02:19 - 02:21]
Now, I have been saying large language model for a long

[02:21 - 02:22]
time.

[02:22 - 02:23]
Now, I will say chat GPT directly.

[02:23 - 02:27]
So, if we talk about chat GPT specifically, then chat GPT

[02:27 - 02:28]
is made by OpenAI.

[02:28 - 02:31]
And somewhere, Microsoft owns it.

[02:31 - 02:35]
Microsoft is integrating this chat GPT in its tools over

[02:35 - 02:36]
the period of time.

[02:36 - 02:40]
But at the present time, there is a very big limitation of

[02:40 - 02:43]
any large language model. That is, it has been given

[02:43 - 02:45]
short-term memory.

[02:45 - 02:48]
At this time, many people are afraid that AI may not be so

[02:48 - 02:50]
strong that it replaces humankind.

[02:50 - 02:53]
So, in this regard, the chat GPT that is being made, all

[02:53 - 02:56]
the large language models that are being made, they are

[02:56 - 02:57]
given a temporary memory.

[02:57 - 02:59]
Now, what does temporary memory mean?

[02:59 - 03:00]
This is the Ghajini scene.

[03:00 - 03:01]
Now, someone will meet you.

[03:01 - 03:02]
You know him.

[03:02 - 03:03]
You are talking to him.

[03:03 - 03:06]
Suddenly, after a while, when he will meet you again, you

[03:06 - 03:07]
don't know who he was.

[03:07 - 03:11]
Now, this short-term memory makes prompting the most tricky.

[03:11 - 03:15]
Because of this, prompting becomes a little advanced.

[03:15 - 03:16]
But don't worry.

[03:16 - 03:20]
I have taught you many frameworks on how to build prompts.

[03:20 - 03:22]
So, let's go to the next chapter.

[03:22 - 03:24]
What are the frameworks of prompts?

[03:24 - 03:26]
How is a prompt built?

[03:26 - 03:28]
First of all, let's know how to create an account on chat

[03:28 - 03:29]
GPT.

[03:29 - 03:32]
And how does basic chat GPT work?

[03:32 - 03:33]
We have to search on Google.

[03:33 - 03:34]
Login to chat GPT.

[03:34 - 03:36]
Click on the topmost site.

[03:36 - 03:39]
Now, it is saying that if you have an open AI account, you

[03:39 - 03:40]
can log in from it.

[03:40 - 03:43]
So, I am assuming that you don't have an open AI account.

[03:43 - 03:45]
So, I will sign up.

[03:45 - 03:46]
We will enter the email id here.

[03:46 - 03:47]
We will continue.

[03:47 - 03:48]
We will keep the password.

[03:48 - 03:48]
Continue.

[03:48 - 03:50]
Now, let's go to our email id and verify it.

[03:51 - 03:52]
Let's click on verify.

[03:52 - 03:53]
Let's refresh it.

[03:53 - 03:54]
It is asking for the name.

[04:06 - 04:07]
It is asking for the number.

[04:07 - 04:08]
Let's enter the number.

[04:08 - 04:11]
It is asking if your number is on WhatsApp or not.

[04:11 - 04:12]
So, I am saying no for now.

[04:13 - 04:15]
If I had said yes, the OTP would have come on WhatsApp.

[04:15 - 04:16]
Continue.

[04:16 - 04:16]
The OTP is coming.

[04:16 - 04:18]
Let's enter the OTP.

[04:18 - 04:20]
Once the OTP is entered, the chat GPT logs in. Now, let's

[04:20 - 04:23]
try to figure out what this interface is all about.

[04:23 - 04:25]
You can write any message here.

[04:25 - 04:26]
For example,

[04:34 - 04:36]
I will write anything.

[04:36 - 04:36]
I will enter it.

[04:36 - 04:38]
It will give me ideas.

[04:41 - 04:44]
Whenever I start a chat, there is a chat on the left-hand

[04:44 - 04:44]
side.

[04:44 - 04:46]
You have the option to edit it.

[04:46 - 04:48]
You can call it testing.

[04:48 - 04:51]
Basically, if you name it properly, your chat GPT will

[04:51 - 04:52]
remain organized.

[04:52 - 04:55]
It will be useful for you in the long term.

[04:55 - 04:59]
For example, if I say that it has been a long time and we

[04:59 - 05:01]
have used it on many different things.

[05:01 - 05:02]
I have the entire history.

[05:02 - 05:05]
If I have to find it, what was there and what was not

[05:05 - 05:07]
there, if I have not organized it,

[05:07 - 05:08]
I will not be able to find it.

[05:08 - 05:09]
If I click on new chat,

[05:09 - 05:12]
I can create a new chat here.

[05:12 - 05:13]
The option of upgrade is coming down.

[05:13 - 05:15]
I can take it on premium.

[05:15 - 05:17]
It is priced at $20 at the moment.

[05:17 - 05:20]
I will recommend that there is no need.

[05:20 - 05:22]
I have been using it for a long time for free.

[05:22 - 05:24]
Everything works for free right now.

[05:24 - 05:26]
Sometimes, there is a delay.

[05:26 - 05:28]
Sometimes, it takes some time to get the answer.

[05:28 - 05:32]
But I have experienced this very rarely.

[05:32 - 05:35]
So go and create an account on your chat GPT because the

[05:35 - 05:38]
videos that are going to come will be on the entire chat

[05:38 - 05:38]
GPT.

[05:39 - 05:42]
And I believe that as we move forward in the course, keep

[05:42 - 05:43]
practicing together.

[05:43 - 05:45]
Open videos on one tab.

[05:45 - 05:49]
Open chat GPT on one tab and keep doing it there.

[05:53 - 05:55]
The first way is prompting.

[05:55 - 05:57]
Ask a question and get the answer.

[05:57 - 06:01]
Like we search on Google that what is the age of Sahil

[06:01 - 06:01]
Khanna?

[06:01 - 06:03]
And Google gives us the answer.

[06:03 - 06:06]
So this is a single question and answer type of prompt.

[06:06 - 06:10]
In the same way, we can ask any question from chat GPT and

[06:10 - 06:12]
it can give us the answer.

[06:12 - 06:15]
For example, I wrote write a product description for a pair

[06:15 - 06:16]
of shoes.

[06:16 - 06:17]
I entered it.

[06:17 - 06:19]
Now it has given us the product description.

[06:19 - 06:23]
So this prompt is a single question and answer type of

[06:23 - 06:24]
prompt.

[06:24 - 06:28]
If I want, I can write anything like sit at home and tell

[06:28 - 06:30]
me how I can earn money.

[06:30 - 06:32]
I can write this type of prompt and it can give me this

[06:32 - 06:33]
type of answer.

[06:33 - 06:35]
So, when we want to create a blog or anything else, the

[06:35 - 06:38]
first step is to come up with a catchy headline. As we

[06:38 - 06:40]
progress through the course, we will learn about different

[06:40 - 06:41]
use cases in detail.

[06:41 - 06:43]
Don't worry, I am just telling you the frameworks.

[06:43 - 06:47]
The next type of prompt is progressive prompting.

[06:47 - 06:48]
What is progressive prompting?

[06:48 - 06:50]
It is not asking a straight question.

[06:50 - 06:51]
First, I am asking a question.

[06:51 - 06:53]
It is giving the answer.

[06:53 - 06:55]
Then regarding that, I am asking another question.

[06:55 - 06:56]
Then it is giving the answer.

[06:56 - 06:58]
Then regarding that, I am asking another question.

[06:58 - 06:59]
Then it is giving another answer.

[06:59 - 07:01]
So basically, we are trying to get a lot of data by

[07:01 - 07:03]
answering questions in this prompt.

[07:03 - 07:05]
For example, look at this example.

[07:05 - 07:08]
I have written a prompt as a marketing consultant.

[07:08 - 07:11]
If you want, you can use this whole framework as it is.

[07:11 - 07:14]
You can write anything here as a marketing consultant.

[07:14 - 07:18]
What are the factors considered when developing a marketing

[07:18 - 07:20]
strategy for a new health and wellness startup?

[07:20 - 07:23]
This developing is our action.

[07:23 - 07:25]
So basically, I am adding a keyword here.

[07:25 - 07:28]
I am telling that if a marketing consultant makes a

[07:28 - 07:32]
marketing strategy for a health and wellness startup, what

[07:32 - 07:33]
will it be?

[07:33 - 07:35]
What factors will he consider?

[07:35 - 07:36]
So I have entered it.

[07:36 - 07:38]
It is telling me a lot of ways.

[07:38 - 07:40]
You have to understand target audience, you have to

[07:40 - 07:41]
understand this, you have to understand that, you have to

[07:41 - 07:42]
understand that.

[07:42 - 07:44]
For example, let's take target audience.

[07:44 - 07:46]
Now, let's make a prompt on target audience.

[07:46 - 07:50]
Given the factor mentioned, how can the startup effectively

[07:50 - 07:52]
segment and target its audience?

[07:52 - 07:53]
Okay.

[07:53 - 07:57]
So I have made a prompt on audience and entered it.

[07:57 - 07:58]
So it is telling me something.

[07:58 - 08:01]
Similarly, I can do the same with all the things.

[08:01 - 08:05]
When it got to know about the audience, then I want to make

[08:05 - 08:07]
targeted messages from it.

[08:07 - 08:08]
Let's assume.

[08:08 - 08:09]
I want a message.

[08:09 - 08:10]
So I have written a prompt for it.

[08:10 - 08:11]
So here, if you see,

[08:11 - 08:13]
I have made a formula for a prompt.

[08:13 - 08:15]
I can write anything here.

[08:15 - 08:16]
Then it has generated it for me.

[08:16 - 08:19]
Now, I have picked a topic from it and asked another

[08:19 - 08:19]
question.

[08:19 - 08:22]
Then I have picked a topic from it and asked another

[08:22 - 08:22]
question.

[08:22 - 08:23]
Now, what I have done is

[08:23 - 08:24]
I have put another prompt in front of it.

[08:24 - 08:27]
Here, I have asked it to make a marketing campaign for me.

[08:27 - 08:27]
I have entered it.

[08:27 - 08:29]
So it is making a campaign for me.

[08:29 - 08:31]
So it has explained some things to me.

[08:31 - 08:32]
Now, I will write something else further.

[08:32 - 08:36]
So, I asked it to use the insights gathered and create a

[08:36 - 08:39]
marketing campaign as a consultant, providing a

[08:39 - 08:40]
comprehensive strategy for me.

[08:40 - 08:42]
And whatever output you are giving me, give it in an

[08:42 - 08:43]
organized way.

[08:43 - 08:44]
Don't give it like this.

[08:44 - 08:46]
You can see, it is making a campaign for me.

[08:46 - 08:49]
So this is the advanced level of prompting.

[08:49 - 08:50]
What are we doing here?

[08:50 - 08:51]
We are giving a sequence here.

[08:51 - 08:52]
First, I asked a question.

[08:52 - 08:54]
Then, it got an answer.

[08:54 - 08:55]
Then, I asked a question.

[08:55 - 08:56]
Then, it got an answer.

[08:56 - 08:57]
And what I did is

[08:57 - 08:59]
I took it to a pro level.

[08:59 - 09:01]
So what I did is first, I asked a question to it.

[09:01 - 09:02]
Then, I let it answer.

[09:02 - 09:03]
I asked a question to it.

[09:03 - 09:04]
Then, I let it answer.

[09:04 - 09:06]
Now, I know some things.

[09:06 - 09:07]
If I talk about myself,

[09:07 - 09:10]
I have been doing marketing work for some time.

[09:10 - 09:11]
So, I know about marketing.

[09:11 - 09:13]
So, I asked a question to it.

[09:13 - 09:14]
It gave me an input.

[09:14 - 09:15]
The most relevant thing for me,

[09:15 - 09:17]
I asked another question regarding that.

[09:17 - 09:19]
Then, it got an input.

[09:19 - 09:20]
Then, I felt that it is wandering.

[09:20 - 09:22]
So, I asked another question.

[09:22 - 09:24]
Then, I asked another question.

[09:24 - 09:26]
Now, it has got a lot of data.

[09:26 - 09:27]
We talked.

[09:27 - 09:30]
All the models have short term memory.

[09:30 - 09:33]
Plus, they have infinite knowledge.

[09:33 - 09:37]
If I directly tell it to make a marketing campaign for me,

[09:37 - 09:39]
for this brand, then it would have made it.

[09:39 - 09:42]
If I am following this method, then I can ask for exact

[09:42 - 09:43]
results.

[09:43 - 09:45]
So, see, what level it has made me.

[09:45 - 09:46]
It has made a whole strategy.

[09:46 - 09:48]
It has told me about target audience.

[09:48 - 09:50]
It has told me about messaging guidelines.

[09:50 - 09:51]
What should I pay attention to?

[09:51 - 09:53]
What should I pay attention to while making a campaign?

[09:53 - 09:56]
What measurements and metrics should I have?

[09:56 - 09:57]
So, I have got all this data.

[09:57 - 10:00]
If I want to know more about each specific aspect, I can

[10:00 - 10:02]
ask for more details. This technique of prompting is

[10:02 - 10:04]
referred to as progressive prompting.

[10:04 - 10:06]
If I talk on my personal level, I like progressive

[10:06 - 10:08]
prompting the most.

[10:08 - 10:10]
And I use it many times.

[10:10 - 10:13]
And here I feel that to use progressive prompting, you

[10:13 - 10:15]
should have the knowledge of that industry.

[10:15 - 10:18]
You should know what you want to do with it.

[10:18 - 10:19]
You should not shoot arrows in the air.

[10:19 - 10:22]
You can shoot arrows in the air too if you ask it that tell

[10:22 - 10:24]
me what all things I can do for it.

[10:25 - 10:26]
It will tell you.

[10:26 - 10:28]
And you can ask it all those things.

[10:28 - 10:31]
But my experience says that if you have some knowledge

[10:31 - 10:35]
about that industry, like in this prompt, I had knowledge

[10:35 - 10:37]
about marketing, then I could make a good prompt.

[10:38 - 10:40]
Now let's come to the next method, that is persona.

[10:40 - 10:43]
Now for example, you do not know marketing.

[10:43 - 10:46]
And you want to learn about marketing from it.

[10:46 - 10:48]
And you want to do things by asking it.

[10:48 - 10:51]
Here I am assuming that you do not know what questions you

[10:51 - 10:53]
are being asked for progressive prompting.

[10:53 - 10:56]
Or you do not know what I have to do.

[10:56 - 10:58]
So you can use these prompts.

[10:58 - 11:02]
And what you can do is that you can tell chat GPT that you

[11:02 - 11:04]
act like this person.

[11:04 - 11:07]
You act like this and tell me how this thing will be.

[11:07 - 11:10]
And for example, what I did here is that you are a talented

[11:10 - 11:13]
analyst at a top tier market research firm.

[11:13 - 11:16]
So I do not know anything about market research.

[11:16 - 11:18]
And I told him that you are educated from Harvard Business

[11:18 - 11:19]
School.

[11:19 - 11:22]
Means you have a lot of knowledge about this industry.

[11:22 - 11:26]
Then I told him that tell me which content should I make

[11:26 - 11:28]
that connects with top executives.

[11:28 - 11:31]
I could have taken any other role instead of top executives.

[11:31 - 11:33]
I have written the company's name after that.

[11:33 - 11:37]
Then I asked him to tell me what questions I should ask.

[11:37 - 11:41]
And prioritize with uncommon and expert advice.

[11:41 - 11:43]
I hit enter.

[11:44 - 11:47]
Now you can see that he has given me a lot of questions.

[11:47 - 11:49]
I did not understand anything about this industry.

[11:49 - 11:51]
I did not know anything about it.

[11:51 - 11:54]
I can get results from it too.

[11:54 - 11:56]
So if you want to get something out of marketing,

[11:56 - 11:59]
You can say, act as a marketing consultant and help me

[11:59 - 12:03]
crafting a strategy for this, this, this, this, this, etc.

[12:03 - 12:05]
And I would like to give a very good tip.

[12:05 - 12:07]
Many people think that we should know English very well.

[12:07 - 12:10]
Only then we will be able to do these things.

[12:10 - 12:12]
If your English is bad, don't worry.

[12:12 - 12:13]
Chat GPT understands.

[12:13 - 12:16]
Yes, but your English should make sense.

[12:16 - 12:18]
If you want to say something and you are writing something

[12:18 - 12:18]
else,

[12:18 - 12:20]
Then chat GPT will understand something else.

[12:20 - 12:21]
Remember this.

[12:21 - 12:23]
So here you see, he has told me everything.

[12:23 - 12:25]
What questions can be asked.

[12:25 - 12:26]
What can happen.

[12:26 - 12:27]
See what a great thing.

[12:27 - 12:29]
Now let's come to the next method.

[12:29 - 12:32]
The next method I use many times to generate the titles of

[12:32 - 12:33]
my YouTube videos.

[12:33 - 12:35]
So what do we do in this?

[12:35 - 12:36]
We give examples in this.

[12:36 - 12:38]
So what is the example method?

[12:38 - 12:41]
In the example method, now we tell chat GPT that I want

[12:41 - 12:42]
this thing.

[12:42 - 12:44]
For example, this type.

[12:44 - 12:46]
Like I give you an example here.

[12:46 - 12:48]
Give me YouTube ideas similar to these topics.

[12:48 - 12:51]
Here I have to write the topic of 5 videos.

[12:51 - 12:52]
So what do I have to do?

[12:52 - 12:53]
I have to press shift and hit enter.

[12:53 - 12:56]
And here I have to write 5 topics related to which I want.

[12:56 - 12:57]
So what do I do?

[12:57 - 12:58]
I go to my YouTube channel.

[12:58 - 13:01]
Or I go to my competitor's YouTube channel.

[13:01 - 13:03]
I like Vivek Bindra.

[13:03 - 13:05]
So I have to make some content like him.

[13:05 - 13:07]
Let's see what he is doing.

[13:07 - 13:09]
I will go to videos.

[13:09 - 13:12]
I will put his most popular videos in the videos.

[13:12 - 13:16]
And I will see which of these are relevant to my needs.

[13:16 - 13:17]
Okay.

[13:17 - 13:18]
So I like this one.

[13:18 - 13:19]
I copied it.

[13:19 - 13:20]
I pasted it.

[13:20 - 13:22]
Chat GPT is a multi-language model.

[13:22 - 13:24]
I would like to tell you one more thing.

[13:24 - 13:26]
If you are writing Hindi or English, everything will work.

[13:26 - 13:27]
Do not worry.

[13:27 - 13:29]
I am pressing shift and hitting enter to change the line.

[13:29 - 13:34]
So what did I do by mistake? I entered by writing 3.

[13:34 - 13:36]
So let's see how it is doing on 3.

[13:36 - 13:37]
Okay, I copied it.

[13:37 - 13:38]
I went ahead and entered.

[13:38 - 13:42]
It is telling that I can make it from Steve Jobs.

[13:42 - 13:44]
I can make it on Jeff Bezos.

[13:44 - 13:45]
I can tell Mahatma Gandhi.

[13:45 - 13:46]
I can make it on Oprah.

[13:46 - 13:48]
I can make it on Warren Buffett.

[13:48 - 13:50]
It gave me ideas.

[13:50 - 13:52]
And this is a very good thing if you see.

[13:52 - 13:53]
I do not understand my topic.

[13:53 - 13:55]
I have to make a video on YouTube.

[13:55 - 13:58]
Or you make carousel posts on Instagram.

[13:58 - 13:59]
You make reels.

[13:59 - 14:00]
You make stories.

[14:00 - 14:01]
You do not understand.

[14:01 - 14:02]
You ask him.

[14:02 - 14:05]
Or you do not understand anything in the world.

[14:05 - 14:06]
I do not understand.

[14:06 - 14:07]
How do I do this thing?

[14:07 - 14:08]
I give some examples.

[14:08 - 14:09]
He will do it.

[14:09 - 14:12]
The next way of prompting is to give context.

[14:12 - 14:13]
Giving context means

[14:13 - 14:18]
I told him to tell me the title of 5 trending ideas on

[14:18 - 14:18]
YouTube.

[14:18 - 14:19]
So he will tell me anything.

[14:19 - 14:24]
If I tell him that my YouTube channel is on business

[14:24 - 14:25]
entrepreneurship.

[14:25 - 14:26]
Now help me.

[14:26 - 14:28]
So what did I do here? I put context.

[14:28 - 14:31]
I told him what I wanted.

[14:31 - 14:36]
So I always believe that if you want to do prompting, then

[14:36 - 14:37]
you must use context.

[14:37 - 14:38]
I mean, let's assume chat GPT.

[14:38 - 14:40]
He has so much knowledge.

[14:40 - 14:41]
He does not know.

[14:41 - 14:42]
What answer do you have to give him?

[14:42 - 14:43]
Until you tell him,

[14:43 - 14:45]
I need something about this thing.

[14:45 - 14:46]
He will not tell you by then.

[14:46 - 14:49]
Like what am I doing here? I am telling him that my channel

[14:49 - 14:49]
is about this.

[14:49 - 14:51]
Give me all the videos ideas.

[14:51 - 14:55]
Prioritize ideas that are uncommon and novel.

[14:55 - 14:56]
I hit enter.

[14:57 - 14:59]
So he gave me some ideas.

[14:59 - 15:02]
So I can get more ideas from him in the same way.

[15:02 - 15:06]
In my opinion, you should also consider the importance of

[15:06 - 15:09]
context if you want to do Prompt Engineering, my friend.

[15:09 - 15:11]
Let me give you another example in this.

[15:11 - 15:14]
I said that for me, comprehensive business plan link is my

[15:14 - 15:15]
digital market agency.

[15:15 - 15:16]
And do include this thing.

[15:16 - 15:19]
Company's product, service, target market, financial

[15:19 - 15:21]
projections, what is going to happen?

[15:21 - 15:22]
I have written digital marketing agency.

[15:22 - 15:25]
Because he must know what is digital marketing agency.

[15:25 - 15:28]
Now if you write D2C, then he will not know what D2C does.

[15:28 - 15:30]
You will have to tell him here.

[15:30 - 15:33]
I sell this dash dash dash dash soap.

[15:33 - 15:34]
Now tell me this thing.

[15:34 - 15:38]
If you tell him that my e-commerce site is there, make a

[15:38 - 15:39]
marketing plan for me.

[15:39 - 15:40]
He will not give.

[15:40 - 15:41]
You have to tell this.

[15:41 - 15:44]
My e-commerce website is about this thing.

[15:44 - 15:47]
These are my top selling products.

[15:47 - 15:49]
Now tell me this thing.

[15:49 - 15:50]
This is a context.

[15:50 - 15:51]
Okay.

[15:51 - 15:55]
I gave him the whole issue that what do I want from you,

[15:55 - 15:55]
brother.

[15:55 - 15:58]
So here you can see that he has made a full presentation

[15:58 - 15:58]
for me.

[15:58 - 16:00]
What can I do?

[16:00 - 16:01]
The next thing is training model.

[16:01 - 16:05]
And I think this is one of the best things.

[16:05 - 16:07]
I misuse it a lot.

[16:07 - 16:09]
Now what is the training model?

[16:09 - 16:12]
Many times what happens is you are not able to explain what

[16:12 - 16:13]
you want to tell him.

[16:13 - 16:14]
Let's assume.

[16:14 - 16:17]
Or you are able to explain, but he does not have the

[16:17 - 16:18]
knowledge of that thing.

[16:18 - 16:23]
So now how can I train him about my things?

[16:23 - 16:24]
So this is a big hack.

[16:24 - 16:26]
What do you have to do? You have to put the URL.

[16:26 - 16:29]
And ask him any question regarding that URL.

[16:29 - 16:30]
He will tell you.

[16:30 - 16:31]
I will give an example and tell you.

[16:31 - 16:32]
This is my website.

[16:32 - 16:34]
I have told him the URL of my website.

[16:34 - 16:36]
My target audience is business owners.

[16:36 - 16:44]
Press shift and then enter and go to another line.

[16:44 - 16:46]
Now I am asking him a question.

[16:46 - 16:49]
What do I have to ask? I have also kept the context here.

[16:49 - 16:50]
If you see,

[16:50 - 16:52]
I have told him that this is my website.

[16:52 - 16:53]
This is my target audience.

[16:53 - 16:56]
And again, if we talk here,

[16:56 - 16:58]
I understand digital marketing.

[16:58 - 17:00]
That's why I am able to keep this context.

[17:00 - 17:03]
If you understand that thing, then you will be able to keep

[17:03 - 17:04]
its context.

[17:04 - 17:07]
But if you're still not getting it, I can show you another

[17:07 - 17:10]
way to understand it through role play.

[17:10 - 17:15]
So, what I did was ask my target audience to help me create

[17:15 - 17:20]
a few lead magnets for this page. I requested him to make

[17:20 - 17:21]
one.

[17:21 - 17:22]
What is this lead magnet?

[17:22 - 17:24]
You must have seen forms in many websites.

[17:24 - 17:25]
They are giving something free.

[17:25 - 17:27]
In return, I am asking him to give his email id, give his

[17:27 - 17:28]
number.

[17:28 - 17:30]
So let's enter and see what he is doing.

[17:30 - 17:32]
I can make a marketing checklist.

[17:32 - 17:34]
I can make a social media guide.

[17:34 - 17:36]
I can give a marketing audit checklist.

[17:36 - 17:39]
I can give an e-book on marketing strategy.

[17:39 - 17:41]
I can offer free marketing.

[17:41 - 17:43]
So you understand what all things he can give.

[17:43 - 17:44]
Now he has given 4.

[17:44 - 17:45]
If I want,

[17:45 - 17:47]
I will use progressive prompt here.

[17:47 - 17:49]
And I will ask him further.

[17:49 - 17:55]
Give me 10 more ideas that are unique.

[17:55 - 17:59]
Now he will give me more ideas.

[17:59 - 18:00]
So if I want here,

[18:00 - 18:02]
I can also put restrictions in it.

[18:02 - 18:06]
That are unique and like this and like this.

[18:06 - 18:07]
If I want,

[18:07 - 18:08]
I can also do it in English.

[18:08 - 18:13]
Like translate this in English.

[18:13 - 18:15]
Here you can see the short memory issue.

[18:15 - 18:17]
He didn't understand what I am talking about.

[18:17 - 18:18]
I can do two options.

[18:18 - 18:26]
Translate the above lead magnet ideas in English.

[18:26 - 18:28]
So what have I done here? I have told him one thing.

[18:28 - 18:31]
I am talking about lead magnet ideas.

[18:31 - 18:32]
Which you have talked above.

[18:32 - 18:35]
So translate that to me.

[18:35 - 18:37]
Now the lead magnet that I am talking about.

[18:37 - 18:39]
This is anchoring.

[18:39 - 18:41]
This is called anchoring.

[18:41 - 18:44]
Whenever you have a short memory issue.

[18:44 - 18:45]
You are asking him.

[18:45 - 18:46]
He is not understanding.

[18:46 - 18:47]
So I had one way.

[18:47 - 18:49]
I will copy the whole content.

[18:49 - 18:51]
I will ask him to translate it.

[18:51 - 18:53]
But I don't want to do this.

[18:53 - 18:54]
So what I did?

[18:54 - 18:55]
I used anchor.

[18:55 - 18:56]
I saw above.

[18:56 - 18:57]
And I saw what he gave in it.

[18:57 - 18:59]
Unique lead magnet ideas.

[18:59 - 19:01]
I used lead magnet as an anchor.

[19:01 - 19:02]
And wrote here.

[19:02 - 19:03]
Because till now,

[19:03 - 19:04]
Till now,

[19:04 - 19:05]
Wherever we have talked about lead magnet.

[19:05 - 19:06]
We have never talked about it.

[19:06 - 19:08]
If I had used something else.

[19:08 - 19:09]
I could have used it as an anchor.

[19:09 - 19:10]
If we go further,

[19:10 - 19:12]
I will explain you in detail.

[19:12 - 19:13]
When to use anchoring.

[19:13 - 19:15]
Now he has made it in Hindi.

[19:15 - 19:16]
If we want,

[19:16 - 19:18]
We can write multiple prompts.

[19:18 - 19:19]
And can transfer it to English.

[19:19 - 19:21]
Because he didn't understand.

[19:21 - 19:22]
He understood English as Hindi.

[19:22 - 19:24]
Now let's go to the next method.

[19:24 - 19:26]
I use the next method many times.

[19:26 - 19:29]
This is used to make many of my work easier.

[19:29 - 19:31]
This is basically a method.

[19:31 - 19:32]
Template method.

[19:32 - 19:34]
What is template method?

[19:34 - 19:36]
We create a template.

[19:36 - 19:39]
And then we get the output.

[19:39 - 19:41]
For example,

[19:41 - 19:43]
I told him that

[19:43 - 19:45]

[24:15 - 24:28]
Anchoring means that whatever we want the bot to remember,

[24:28 - 24:40]
we use a specific word. For example, I told it that my

[24:40 - 24:51]
company is Lapaas, whose target audience is this and

[24:51 - 25:04]
provides these services. Basically, I trained it about

[25:04 - 25:16]
Lapaas. If I forget, I can use the anchoring technique.

[25:16 - 25:34]

[27:45 - 27:48]
content

[27:51 - 27:58]
characteristics For example, I speak informally, I joke

[27:58 - 28:01]
around, I like to have fun.

[28:01 - 28:06]
This is my personality. Similarly, you will have your

[28:06 - 28:11]
personality. Now you have to tell them that you write like

[28:11 - 28:11]
this.

[28:11 - 28:15]
But the story is that I don't know what my personality is.

[28:15 - 28:18]
How can I understand my personality? I understand formal,

[28:18 - 28:19]
informal humorous.

[28:19 - 28:20]
I understand these things.

[28:20 - 28:24]
But how can I explain other things? Let's talk about

[28:24 - 28:28]
personality. To understand your personality, we have

[28:28 - 28:29]
divided it into 5 parts.

[28:29 - 28:34]
The first thing is tone. What is the tone of my speech? I

[28:34 - 28:36]
am not saying that I speak very surreal.

[28:36 - 28:42]
Tone means I am friendly, humorous, playful, I speak in fun.

[28:42 - 28:44]
What do I say?

[28:44 - 28:47]
So there are many styles of tone. I will show you on the

[28:47 - 28:48]
screen what are the styles of tone.

[28:48 - 28:53]
You have to see what is the style of your tone. And you

[28:53 - 28:55]
have to write it down for future cases.

[28:55 - 29:00]
For example, you are seeing two names. Friendly and

[29:00 - 29:03]
assertive. Friendly is a positive tone.

[29:03 - 29:07]
Assertive means non-positive tone. But this is not bad. You

[29:07 - 29:08]
are as you are.

[29:08 - 29:13]
Don't write to make your personality good. Whatever your

[29:13 - 29:14]
personality is, do that.

[29:14 - 29:19]
Or whatever tone you want to write. You speak in anger but

[29:19 - 29:23]
you want your content to be playful. You can do that.

[29:23 - 29:28]
So basically according to me, tone works in 6 factors. You

[29:28 - 29:30]
see what you are in these 6 factors.

[29:30 - 29:33]
And highlight all of them and write.

[29:33 - 29:38]
Next is register. What is register? Register means how the

[29:38 - 29:40]
other person registers you in their mind.

[29:40 - 29:45]
Here we are not talking about fun loving. We are talking

[29:45 - 29:47]
about formal, informal, professional.

[29:47 - 29:50]
What is it basically? We are talking about this personality.

[29:50 - 29:53]
So basically there are 3 types of personality. There are 2

[29:53 - 29:53]
sides to it.

[29:53 - 29:58]
Again see what is your personality. Or whatever content you

[29:58 - 29:59]
want to write.

Now the story is not over here Most of the people will

[40:16 - 40:16]
think that the story is over here But I believe that the

[40:16 - 40:16]
story has just started here You have taught it first and

[40:16 - 40:16]
then you have taken the

[40:16 - 40:17]
output from it But this output has to be done on your tone

[40:17 - 40:19]
Which we talked about personality

[40:19 - 40:21]
It has to be done on that too

[40:21 - 40:23]
So I told you that you have to write your style

[40:24 - 40:27]

[40:29 - 40:32]
I have told you all the styles, components and everything

[40:32 - 40:34]
So first of all, let's make this content in our tone

[40:35 - 40:41]
Write this in a friendly tone Level 1 is done, it is

[40:41 - 40:44]
writing the content in our tone

[40:44 - 40:45]
Level 2

[40:45 - 40:47]
What we are going to do in level 2

[40:47 - 40:51]
We are going to tell our style We can use registrar but now

[40:51 - 40:52]
I am taking it to the next level

[40:52 - 40:55]
Make it persuasive Let's enter

[40:55 - 40:59]
I have taken this persuasive from the same sheet

[40:59 - 41:01]
I have used it from the style sheet

[41:01 - 41:03]
I can use multiple too

[41:03 - 41:07]
Persuasive playful dash comma comma comma comma

[41:07 - 41:08]
Whatever I want to write

[41:08 - 41:11]
But ideally, don't give more than 1-2 characteristics

[41:11 - 41:14]
Otherwise, it will get confused that on whom to focus more

[41:14 - 41:16]
Now I have told it my style

[41:16 - 41:19]
Now next I have to tell it my attitude

[41:19 - 41:21]
Again I have told you the attitude

[41:22 - 41:25]
Let's select an attitude which matches our personality

[41:25 - 41:30]
Make it more conversational

[41:30 - 41:36]
Now it has made it conversational Basically, what we are

[41:36 - 41:37]
doing here

[41:37 - 41:41]
We are mapping all the content on our personality

[41:41 - 41:45]
And it is giving us the content according to our personality

[41:45 - 41:47]
Now if you want, you can also put registrar

[41:47 - 41:51]
That you want to keep it formal, informal or not

[41:51 - 41:52]
It is your wish

[41:52 - 41:55]
Now I feel that the level at which our content has been made

[41:55 - 41:56]
I am happy with it

[41:56 - 41:57]
Next step

[41:57 - 41:59]
What is the next step?

[41:59 - 42:01]
Next step, let us tell about our product and service

[42:01 - 42:05]
Till now we have only talked about generic This generic is

[42:05 - 42:08]
being told to us We are also being told this in generic

[42:08 - 42:11]
So now chat, GPT, prompting course, it understands

[42:11 - 42:13]
But let's assume that I sell a soap

[42:13 - 42:16]
Soap has generic content

[42:16 - 42:18]
So if I am getting it written, you are getting it written

[42:18 - 42:19]
Someone else is getting it written

[42:19 - 42:20]
So the content of the soap is going to be right

[42:20 - 42:23]
But there must be some speciality in my soap

[42:23 - 42:26]
I must have some USP

[42:26 - 42:28]
So I have to identify that USP

[42:28 - 42:31]
So here you have to use your brain a little

[42:31 - 42:34]
Or you can cheat here too

[42:34 - 42:36]
You can write one more prompt

[42:36 - 42:39]
Tell me what is the USP of this product

[42:39 - 42:41]
But this is not the right method

[42:41 - 42:43]
I will not recommend it at all

[42:43 - 42:47]
I believe that if you are marketing a product

[42:47 - 42:49]
If you are marketing a product

[42:49 - 42:52]
If it is yours and you don't know the USP

[42:52 - 42:54]
Then please don't work on that product

[42:54 - 42:57]
If you are marketing a product of a customer

[42:57 - 42:59]
Or you are doing its copywriting

[42:59 - 43:01]
Then it will always know the USP

[43:01 - 43:03]
What is the mode of our product

[43:03 - 43:06]
What is it that makes our product different

[43:06 - 43:08]
So let's assume here

[43:08 - 43:12]
My mode is my teaching style

[43:12 - 43:14]
And my experience

[43:14 - 43:17]
So let's put more emphasis on teaching style

[43:17 - 43:21]
And experience of the trainer

[43:21 - 43:26]
Let's hit enter

[43:26 - 43:29]
Now it is rewriting the content for us again

[43:29 - 43:32]
By highlighting our USPs

[43:32 - 43:35]
Are the steps over here

[43:35 - 43:38]
Actually the steps are not over here

[43:38 - 43:40]
At this time we have made the landing page content

[43:40 - 43:43]
Now let's assume that you are making headings for your

[43:43 - 43:43]
website

[43:44 - 43:47]
So let's assume that we are making headings for our website

[43:48 - 43:50]
So let's test it first

[43:50 - 43:53]
Does it remember who we are and what is our audience

[43:54 - 43:57]
I believe that if you don't create a chat

[43:57 - 43:58]
Then it will forget

[43:58 - 44:01]
If you talk about only one topic in that chat

[44:01 - 44:04]
Then it will remember it 99%

[44:04 - 44:05]
So what I do is

[44:05 - 44:08]
Create 10 landing page headings for this page

[44:08 - 44:13]
So it has given the headings

[44:13 - 44:16]
So let's assume that it has done everything according to

[44:16 - 44:17]
our theme

[44:17 - 44:19]
But the story is

[44:19 - 44:21]
When we are using the headings

[44:21 - 44:24]
I want my website's headings to be in 5-6 words

[44:24 - 44:25]
Not so long

[44:25 - 44:28]
As I can see that it is making it very long

[44:28 - 44:33]
So I will make it in 4-5 words

[44:33 - 44:36]
So normally when we run Google ads We have a limit of

[44:36 - 44:37]
characters

[44:37 - 44:39]
Because of the limit of characters

[44:39 - 44:41]
We need to keep our content concise. This can help you

[44:41 - 44:44]
achieve that. However, I must warn you that it may not be

[44:44 - 44:46]
completely accurate.

[44:46 - 44:49]
That you made it in 5-6 words It will never make it in 5-6

[44:49 - 44:50]
words

[44:50 - 44:51]
Sometimes it will come back

[44:51 - 44:53]
If I ask for more options

[44:53 - 44:55]
Then I get the right options

[44:55 - 44:56]
So see what it has done here

[44:56 - 44:59]
Beat writer's blog today etc.

[44:59 - 45:01]
So if you see here

[45:01 - 45:05]
It has made it in 4-5 words And it has made it very well If

[45:05 - 45:10]
we ask a professional copywriter to write content

[45:10 - 45:12]
Write content for website

[45:12 - 45:13]
Write content for website

[45:13 - 45:14]
Write mail

[45:14 - 45:17]
Like we have a brand on board Now we have to make a landing

[45:17 - 45:19]
page for that brand

[45:19 - 45:21]
We have to make the heading of the landing page

[45:21 - 45:23]
We have to make the content After making the content

[45:23 - 45:25]
What will be posted on the social media

[45:25 - 45:27]
The header of the social media

[45:27 - 45:31]
After the header of the social media The emails will be made

[45:31 - 45:32]
Which email will go

[45:32 - 45:34]
You can also do dripping

[45:34 - 45:35]
What is dripping

[45:35 - 45:38]
In the email, you must have seen You get the first email

[45:38 - 45:39]
Then after some time you get the second email

[45:39 - 45:41]
Then after some time you get the third email

[45:41 - 45:42]
First day one came

[45:42 - 45:43]
Then the second day one more came

[45:43 - 45:44]
Then the fifth day one more came

[45:44 - 45:45]
Then the sixth day one more came

[45:45 - 45:49]
This is dripping So we can also create dripping with this

[45:49 - 45:51]
With the same method

[45:51 - 45:54]
So the framework I am telling you on copywriting

[45:54 - 45:56]
You can do this for anything

[45:56 - 45:59]
First of all, you have to train it for your audience

[45:59 - 46:01]
After that whatever you ask for it It will be given

[46:01 - 46:03]
according to your audience

[46:03 - 46:06]
So now when we are going to move forward in the course

[46:06 - 46:08]
So I am not going to iterate this whole method again and

[46:08 - 46:09]
again

[46:09 - 46:13]
I will directly show you the action prompts That I will ask

[46:13 - 46:15]
him to create this for me

[46:15 - 46:16]
Create this for me

[46:16 - 46:17]
Create this for me

[46:17 - 46:19]
When we have trained it in the starting

[46:19 - 46:20]
Who is our audience

[46:20 - 46:22]
What are our pain points

[46:22 - 46:25]
Or later we have converted that content in our style

[46:25 - 46:27]
I am not going to repeat it again and again

[46:27 - 46:31]
I will show you the prompts directly So that your mind opens

[46:31 - 46:32]
You understand

[46:32 - 46:34]
That we can create action prompts like this

[46:34 - 46:38]
We can create these prompts for this So my idea is that you

[46:38 - 46:40]
can make prompts yourself

[46:40 - 46:44]
And apart from prompts, whatever results you want

[46:44 - 46:46]
You can get the results

[46:46 - 46:47]
So by repeating things again and again

[46:47 - 46:49]
I don't want to increase the duration of the course

[46:49 - 46:51]
And I don't want to waste your time

[46:51 - 46:53]
My belief is that it is the value of your time

[46:53 - 46:55]
So in your time value

[46:55 - 46:57]
I want to cover more things in less time

[46:57 - 47:00]
If you want, you can also create reviews from here

[47:00 - 47:02]
You can review our course

[47:02 - 47:03]
I have seen it personally

[47:03 - 47:07]
Many students do not review because they like the course

[47:07 - 47:09]
But many students don't leave reviews because they're not

[47:09 - 47:12]
sure what to write. Should I just ask for a positive review

[47:12 - 47:15]
or give them more guidance on what to include?

[47:15 - 47:18]
If you want to write a review Then chat gpt can also help

[47:18 - 47:22]
you You can get a review in your style from chat gpt

[47:22 - 47:24]
So if you are enjoying the course Then please go to the

[47:24 - 47:25]
review section

[47:25 - 47:27]
Give this course a review

[47:27 - 47:28]
If you give more reviews

[47:28 - 47:33]
Then the new people who will come Then you will get to know

[47:33 - 47:37]
What level of detail we are going into in the course

[47:37 - 47:41]
In this video, let's talk about how you can use chat gpt

[47:41 - 47:43]
You can do SEO

[47:43 - 47:47]
You can't rely on it properly for SEO

[47:47 - 47:50]
You will have to take the help of other tools

[47:50 - 47:52]
But I want to tell you a story

[47:52 - 47:57]
We did an experiment a few years ago At the time when these

[47:57 - 47:58]
tech tools came out

[47:58 - 48:00]
So what did we do?

[48:00 - 48:01]
I said this is a very good thing

[48:01 - 48:02]
You write a question

[48:02 - 48:06]
I was making content on it Why not make a blog on it So we

[48:06 - 48:07]
made a whole website

[48:07 - 48:11]
Where we put about 1200 pieces of content

[48:11 - 48:12]
Put blogs

[48:12 - 48:14]
And if I talk about it in the starting

[48:14 - 48:16]
There was a lot of traffic on that website

[48:16 - 48:18]
That website was running well

[48:18 - 48:23]
We had also put adsense on that website And it was also

[48:23 - 48:28]
giving good revenue Suddenly at the start of this year That

[48:28 - 48:29]
website went dead

[48:29 - 48:33]
If I talk about that website now, it only gets around

[48:33 - 48:37]
1500-2000 visitors per month, but it used to get close to a

[48:37 - 48:39]
million visitors at one point.

[48:39 - 48:42]
So what is the reason for this? The reason for this is

[48:42 - 48:43]
When these things came in the starting

[48:43 - 48:45]
People were doing less

[48:45 - 48:46]
Now people started doing more

[48:46 - 48:48]
And Google has understood this

[48:48 - 48:53]
So Google does not rank content created by large language

[48:53 - 48:56]
models This is what my experience says

[48:56 - 49:01]
And there is a way out for this How can you solve this?

[49:01 - 49:03]
Ideally I will not recommend

[49:03 - 49:06]
You make blogs from this

[49:06 - 49:10]
Yes, blogs can be optimized from this Blog research can be

[49:10 - 49:15]
done from this Blog ideas can be taken from this What can I

[49:15 - 49:15]
do?

[49:15 - 49:17]
But I believe that

[49:17 - 49:19]
If you write content yourself

[49:19 - 49:23]
Then there will be higher chances of ranking And there is a

[49:23 - 49:25]
small hack too Which you can use

[49:25 - 49:29]
We have experimented it on a small level It is working

[49:29 - 49:30]
little by little

[49:30 - 49:34]
Till now there are no extremely good results But no bad

[49:34 - 49:34]
results

[49:34 - 49:36]
It is working fine

[49:36 - 49:40]
So first of all let's understand about SEO Here I am not

[49:40 - 49:41]
going to teach you SEO

[49:41 - 49:43]
What are the factors of SEO?

[49:43 - 49:45]
How is SEO done?

[49:45 - 49:46]
How is indexing done?

[49:46 - 49:48]
But here I am going to explain to you

[49:48 - 49:50]
If you understand SEO

[49:50 - 49:53]
Then what all things you can do from chat gpt

[49:53 - 49:58]
First of all I can research keyword On chat gpt What I have

[49:58 - 49:58]
to do?

[49:58 - 50:02]
I have to write, generate 10 long tail keywords for website

[50:02 - 50:03]
about EA

[50:03 - 50:06]
So he will make content for me

[50:06 - 50:07]
What all we can put

[50:07 - 50:09]
Best digital marketing strategy for small business etc etc

[50:09 - 50:10]
etc

[50:10 - 50:12]
So he has made long tail keywords for us

[50:13 - 50:15]
So first of all, I will explain some keywords

[50:16 - 50:19]
Many people don't know in depth about SEO

[50:19 - 50:21]
So what are keywords basically?

[50:21 - 50:23]
Keywords are those things

[50:23 - 50:24]
Like if you search on Google

[50:25 - 50:26]
You searched on Google

[50:26 - 50:28]
Google is showing you a lot of results

[50:28 - 50:30]
So what does Google do?

[50:30 - 50:34]
Google tries to understand your search and the website you

[50:34 - 50:35]
have made

[50:35 - 50:38]
The search you have made is called query

[50:38 - 50:40]
So according to your query

[50:40 - 50:41]
Google shows you the best website

[50:42 - 50:44]
And Google uploads it

[50:44 - 50:47]
Now according to query, the website shown

[50:47 - 50:50]
That website has those keywords

[50:50 - 50:51]
Means it talks about those things

[50:52 - 50:55]
That's why Google thinks this website is relevant

[50:55 - 50:56]
Here I won't go into detail

[50:57 - 50:59]
What are keywords and what are not

[50:59 - 51:01]
But for those who understand

[51:01 - 51:02]
I will give some more understanding

[51:03 - 51:06]
On what level is chatgpt's keyword research right?

[51:06 - 51:08]
See, simple thing

[51:08 - 51:09]
If we talk about keyword research

[51:10 - 51:12]
There are many tools in the market

[51:12 - 51:14]
Which are paid and some are free

[51:14 - 51:17]
Which tell us that these keywords are good

[51:17 - 51:18]
This keyword's volume is this much

[51:19 - 51:21]
This is searched by so many people

[51:21 - 51:24]
So here we asked for long tail keywords from chatgpt

[51:24 - 51:26]
So what chatgpt is doing

[51:26 - 51:28]
Such long tail keywords

[51:28 - 51:30]
Such big keyword clusters

[51:30 - 51:32]
It is finding and finding for us

[51:32 - 51:33]
Which is relevant according to it

[51:34 - 51:36]
And people search for it

[51:36 - 51:38]
If we check its volume

[51:38 - 51:39]
Then we will get an idea

[51:40 - 51:41]
Which of these are actually relevant

[51:42 - 51:44]
Which are not relevant

[51:44 - 51:46]
These results we have got

[51:46 - 51:48]
These are just results

[51:48 - 51:50]
We have to do keyword research on one level

[51:51 - 51:53]
Whether its volume is there or not

[51:53 - 51:54]
If we want, we can also create keyword clusters

[51:55 - 51:56]
And those who don't know SEO

[51:57 - 51:59]
Don't worry

[51:59 - 52:01]
Right now I am just explaining you

[52:01 - 52:03]
What is keyword and what is keyword cluster

[52:03 - 52:04]
Then I will use all these to teach you how to make a blog

[52:05 - 52:06]
And how to make that blog

[52:07 - 52:08]
In such a way that Google can't catch it

[52:09 - 52:10]
I will teach you that too

[52:11 - 52:13]
Don't worry

[52:13 - 52:14]
But again my recommendation will be

[52:15 - 52:17]
You should learn SEO properly

[52:17 - 52:18]
Then only you will be able to do these things properly

[52:19 - 52:21]
So I hit enter

[52:21 - 52:23]
Keyword cluster

[52:23 - 52:24]
It is creating a keyword cluster

[52:25 - 52:26]
It is saying what can be a keyword cluster

[52:27 - 52:29]
One is SEO

[52:29 - 52:31]
In SEO, this comes

[52:31 - 52:33]
In content marketing, this comes

[52:33 - 52:34]
This comes, this comes, this comes

[52:35 - 52:37]
So I have also got this cluster

[52:37 - 52:39]
Now what I will do

[52:39 - 52:41]
After getting the cluster

[52:41 - 52:43]
I will say

[52:43 - 52:45]
Give me some blog ideas

[52:45 - 52:47]
With the above keyword cluster

[52:47 - 52:49]
So basically what I did

[52:49 - 52:51]
I asked for some keywords from here

[52:51 - 52:53]
I got the keywords

[52:53 - 52:55]
I researched them

[52:55 - 52:56]
Now I have to use one keyword from these

[52:57 - 52:59]
And I have to find its clusters

[52:59 - 53:01]
After finding those clusters

[53:01 - 53:02]
I will ask for blog ideas

[53:03 - 53:08]
Now it is giving me a lot of ideas

[53:08 - 53:10]
So for now to explain you

[53:10 - 53:12]
I have used very broad, digital marketing etc

[53:12 - 53:14]
Ideally we have to go in niche

[53:14 - 53:16]
Healthcare marketing

[53:16 - 53:18]
If I talk about digital marketing

[53:18 - 53:20]
So healthcare marketing has become a little small

[53:20 - 53:22]
So I will find clusters around healthcare marketing

[53:22 - 53:24]
Around that cluster

[53:24 - 53:26]
I will find blog ideas

[53:26 - 53:28]
I don't want to go technical

[53:28 - 53:30]
You should know digital marketing

[53:30 - 53:32]
My goal has always been

[53:32 - 53:34]
You should understand things

[53:34 - 53:36]
Here it has given us a lot of ideas

[53:36 - 53:38]
Like I like this idea

[53:38 - 53:40]
For example, I have this

[53:40 - 53:42]
So let's say this is my topic

[53:42 - 53:44]
On which I want to write content

[53:44 - 53:46]
I have selected my topic from this process

[53:46 - 53:48]
Then what we will do

[53:48 - 53:50]
I have entered

[53:50 - 54:00]
Now we have this result

[54:00 - 54:02]
Now what we will do

[54:02 - 54:04]
Let's select a topic from this

[54:04 - 54:06]
Whichever we like

[54:06 - 54:08]
So I will assume

[54:08 - 54:10]
This is the ultimate guide to Google Ads

[54:10 - 54:12]
Getting started with PPC advertising

[54:12 - 54:14]
So what I did is I copied it

[54:14 - 54:16]
And I will start a new chat for this

[54:16 - 54:18]
Because if I will do it from the old chat

[54:18 - 54:20]
It can get confused

[54:20 - 54:22]
So it is better to paste it first

[54:22 - 54:24]
So now what we have to do

[54:24 - 54:26]
I will directly say write a blog on this topic

[54:26 - 54:28]
But according to me

[54:28 - 54:30]
This is not the right way

[54:30 - 54:32]
If you want to write a blog

[54:32 - 54:34]
Blog should be descriptive

[54:34 - 54:36]
It should be explanatory

[54:36 - 54:38]
So what I will do

[54:38 - 54:40]
Create outline for a blog

[54:40 - 54:44]
On Inverted commas

[54:44 - 54:46]
Create outline for a blog

[54:46 - 54:48]
For this topic

[54:48 - 54:54]
I will enter

[54:54 - 54:56]
So it has told me what headings I can put

[54:56 - 54:58]
First of all

[54:58 - 55:02]
Introduction Explanation of Google Ads

[55:02 - 55:04]
Importance of Google Ads

[55:04 - 55:08]
Dash So now what we have to do

[55:08 - 55:10]
Now I will take this content

[55:10 - 55:12]
On the same copywriting framework

[55:12 - 55:14]
And I will individually

[55:14 - 55:16]
Make pieces for each content

[55:16 - 55:18]
Like in starting

[55:18 - 55:20]
Explanation of Google Ads

[55:20 - 55:22]
But if we see overall

[55:22 - 55:24]
We have to write introduction

[55:24 - 55:26]
Introduction of this blog

[55:26 - 55:30]
In Now I will write my style

[55:30 - 55:32]
In conversational

[55:32 - 55:34]
And friendly tone

[55:34 - 55:44]
So it has written

[55:44 - 55:48]
Now I have to open google docs Copy paste

[55:48 - 55:50]
Our heading is ready

[55:50 - 55:57]
Enter So it has given us an outline

[55:57 - 56:02]
Copy paste

[56:02 - 56:04]
Now what we have to do

[56:04 - 56:14]
Explanation of Google Ads

[56:14 - 56:16]
Google Ads

[56:16 - 56:31]
Importance of Google Ads Now in this way

[56:31 - 56:33]
We can write each topic

[56:33 - 56:37]
Individually I don't want to waste your time

[56:37 - 56:39]
Because my goal is

[56:39 - 56:41]
To explain you things in minimum time

[56:41 - 56:43]
So what we have to do

[56:43 - 56:49]
Copy paste

[56:49 - 56:51]
So we have content

[56:51 - 56:53]
Let's say we will make

[56:53 - 56:55]
Whole piece of content

[56:55 - 56:57]
To save time

[56:57 - 56:59]
I am not wasting your time

[56:59 - 57:01]
Now what you have to do

[57:01 - 57:03]
You have to

[57:03 - 57:07]
Paraphrase And after paraphrasing

[57:07 - 57:09]
You have to put it in your website

[57:09 - 57:11]
Now I am telling you

[57:11 - 57:13]
One very important thing

[57:13 - 57:15]
You have to paraphrase this content

[57:15 - 57:17]
If not today

[57:17 - 57:19]
Google will catch it

[57:19 - 57:21]
And it will give hindrance in your SEO process

[57:21 - 57:23]
Ideally what I think

[57:23 - 57:25]
This is my step

[57:25 - 57:27]
First make content

[57:27 - 57:29]
After that understand this content and write it

[57:29 - 57:31]
This is the best way

[57:31 - 57:33]
I have seen many ways

[57:33 - 57:35]
People say write prompt

[57:35 - 57:37]
Write like human

[57:37 - 57:39]
Use i and u

[57:39 - 57:41]
Use this and that

[57:41 - 57:43]
I think you should not do this

[57:43 - 57:45]
You are doing it now

[57:45 - 57:47]
You will face problem later

[57:47 - 57:49]
If you want to write content in real

[57:49 - 57:51]
Then write content

[57:51 - 57:53]
In today's time

[57:53 - 57:55]
AI tools

[57:55 - 57:57]
Yes it has made it easy

[57:57 - 57:59]
But it has not replaced it

[57:59 - 58:01]
I will not recommend

[58:01 - 58:03]
To go from this process

[58:03 - 58:05]
But this process

[58:05 - 58:07]
You can make your own content

[58:07 - 58:09]
If you want

[58:09 - 58:11]
You can paraphrase

[58:11 - 58:13]
And publish it

[58:13 - 58:15]
I am giving you a warning

[58:15 - 58:17]
There are high chances that it will not work

[58:17 - 58:19]
Yes you can't write blog

[58:19 - 58:21]
But you can do other things

[58:21 - 58:23]
There is no issue

[58:23 - 58:25]
We have made one type of blog

[58:25 - 58:27]
You can make different types of blog

[58:27 - 58:29]
We have made informator

[58:29 - 58:31]
You can make it listical blog

[58:31 - 58:33]
How to blog

[58:33 - 58:35]
Let's ask listical blog

[58:35 - 58:37]
Give me ideas

[58:37 - 58:39]
For listical

[58:39 - 58:43]
Blog On ppc

[58:43 - 58:49]
Advertising What are listical blogs

[58:49 - 58:55]
Those who don't know 7 common ppc mistakes 7 essential

[58:55 - 58:57]
Give me ideas

[58:57 - 58:59]
For how to blog on ppc advertising

[58:59 - 59:01]
Now there is one way

[59:01 - 59:03]
I will tell you

[59:03 - 59:05]
What they are doing

[59:05 - 59:07]
They make blogs from youtube videos

[59:07 - 59:09]
What they do

[59:09 - 59:11]
They take scripts from youtube videos

[59:11 - 59:13]
And make blog from it

[59:13 - 59:15]
And say wow we have earned money from it

[59:15 - 59:17]
But i will tell you

[59:17 - 59:19]
A better way

[59:19 - 59:21]
I have opened my youtube channel

[59:21 - 59:23]
Sahil Khanna

[59:23 - 59:25]
I have selected the video

[59:25 - 59:27]
Which has subtitles

[59:27 - 59:29]
Like this

[59:29 - 59:31]
I have to open it

[59:31 - 59:33]
Go to show transcription

[59:33 - 59:35]
It will give me full content

[59:35 - 59:37]
I will click on it

[59:37 - 59:39]
I will copy it

[59:39 - 59:41]
I will go to chat gpt

[59:41 - 59:43]
I will create a new chat

[59:43 - 59:45]
Turn this youtube video script

[59:45 - 59:47]
Into a blog

[59:47 - 59:49]
And paste it

[59:49 - 59:51]
It has made a blog

[59:51 - 59:53]
Now see

[59:53 - 59:55]
There are two steps

[59:55 - 59:57]
One is to copy paste it

[59:57 - 59:59]
Second is

[59:59 - 01:00:02]
Copy paste it go to any tool of any rewriter and rewrite it

[01:00:02 - 01:00:03]
and put it.

[01:00:03 - 01:00:06]
The third way is that you take an idea from here and create

[01:00:06 - 01:00:07]
your content.

[01:00:07 - 01:00:10]
Okay, I am leaving all three choices with you.

[01:00:10 - 01:00:14]
Like if I talk about myself, then if I take any interviews,

[01:00:14 - 01:00:19]
I want to publish a blog around that interview, then I can

[01:00:19 - 01:00:20]
publish that blog.

[01:00:20 - 01:00:23]
Here it does not make any difference to me that Google

[01:00:23 - 01:00:24]
thinks that it is AI or not.

[01:00:24 - 01:00:26]
Google thinks that there is no problem.

[01:00:26 - 01:00:27]
The traffic that is going to come to me is going to come

[01:00:27 - 01:00:28]
from social media.

[01:00:29 - 01:00:31]
I do not need the traffic of search.

[01:00:31 - 01:00:33]
Okay, this is out of the game of SEO.

[01:00:33 - 01:00:35]
But I can also use it.

[01:00:35 - 01:00:39]
I can also generate social media posts from this in the

[01:00:39 - 01:00:40]
same way.

[01:00:40 - 01:00:46]
Give me a 7 slide Instagram carousel idea on this blog.

[01:00:46 - 01:00:50]
Give me all slide content and headings.

[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]
So what do we have to do in slide 1?

[01:00:53 - 01:00:54]
What to write on slide 2?

[01:00:55 - 01:00:56]
What to write on slide 3?

[01:00:56 - 01:00:59]
He made content from my entire video.

[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]
For this, I had to hire a person.

[01:01:02 - 01:01:04]
He used to do research.

[01:01:04 - 01:01:05]
He used to watch blogs.

[01:01:05 - 01:01:06]
He used to do this.

[01:01:06 - 01:01:07]
There is no tension.

[01:01:07 - 01:01:09]
Anyone's video is being published now.

[01:01:09 - 01:01:10]
You do not feel like reading it.

[01:01:10 - 01:01:12]
Its transcription has been done.

[01:01:12 - 01:01:13]
Pick up the transcription.

[01:01:13 - 01:01:15]
Put the chat in GPT.

[01:01:15 - 01:01:17]
Tell him to make notes for me.

[01:01:17 - 01:01:18]
He will make notes for you.

[01:01:18 - 01:01:21]
If you want to make a blog from the same chat, you can make

[01:01:21 - 01:01:21]
a blog.

[01:01:22 - 01:01:26]
If you want to make a video idea from the same topic, you

[01:01:26 - 01:01:28]
can do that.

[01:01:28 - 01:01:30]
If you want to make a podcast from the same topic, you can

[01:01:30 - 01:01:31]
do that.

[01:01:31 - 01:01:32]
From the same process.

[01:01:32 - 01:01:34]
Now what else can we do in SEO?

[01:01:34 - 01:01:38]
We can get Alt text description from chat GPT.

[01:01:38 - 01:01:44]
Write Alt text description for a image for chat GPT

[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]
prompting course.

[01:01:47 - 01:01:48]
Enter it.

[01:01:53 - 01:01:56]
He gave me the description of the image and also gave me

[01:01:56 - 01:01:56]
the Alt text.

[01:01:56 - 01:02:00]
What image can you use and what Alt text can you use?

[01:02:00 - 01:02:05]
Basically, what image should you put on what topic? You do

[01:02:05 - 01:02:08]
not have that idea in the blog.

[01:02:08 - 01:02:10]
It will also help you on that.

[01:02:10 - 01:02:11]
Let's do one more thing.

[01:02:11 - 01:02:16]
Give me internal links, ideas for the blog.

[01:02:16 - 01:02:19]
Now I think he will not be able to remember the blog.

[01:02:19 - 01:02:21]
So I am doing anchoring for this.

[01:02:21 - 01:02:22]
I am writing the same above.

[01:02:23 - 01:02:28]
So he is giving me the idea of Alt text.

[01:02:28 - 01:02:30]
Where can I put Alt text?

[01:02:30 - 01:02:32]
I have seen many times when they are doing SEO.

[01:02:32 - 01:02:36]
He recommends them to use Alt text.

[01:02:36 - 01:02:39]
But they do not understand where to use and why to use.

[01:02:39 - 01:02:40]
So they do it on anyone.

[01:02:40 - 01:02:43]
Again, these things can help you today.

[01:02:43 - 01:02:46]
Now I am going to take this level to Ultra Pro Max level.

[01:02:46 - 01:02:47]
Now what are we going to do?

[01:02:47 - 01:02:50]
Now we are going to use the learning mechanism.

[01:02:50 - 01:02:53]
We will pick up the existing site on the internet.

[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]
We will analyze it and make content around it.

[01:02:55 - 01:02:58]
For example, I will go to my site.

[01:02:58 - 01:03:02]
Let's pick it up.

[01:03:02 - 01:03:04]
So I have picked up a blog randomly.

[01:03:04 - 01:03:08]
What you have to do is, You have to pick up the top pages

[01:03:08 - 01:03:10]
of your competitors.

[01:03:10 - 01:03:12]
Those pages which are ranking at the top.

[01:03:12 - 01:03:15]
So let's say this is the top page of my website.

[01:03:15 - 01:03:17]
For example, I have to copy it.

[01:03:17 - 01:03:21]
Help me with the long tail or medium tail keyword for this

[01:03:21 - 01:03:22]
blog.

[01:03:22 - 01:03:23]
Let's hit enter.

[01:03:23 - 01:03:29]
Now it has given me the keywords.

[01:03:29 - 01:03:30]
Now I have got the keywords.

[01:03:30 - 01:03:32]
Now we can follow the same process.

[01:03:32 - 01:03:37]
Let's make a piece of content by combining these keywords.

[01:03:37 - 01:03:47]
Give me a blog idea covering all these keywords.

[01:03:47 - 01:03:48]
Now it has forgotten.

[01:03:48 - 01:03:49]
So what do we do?

[01:03:49 - 01:03:50]
Let's go here.

[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]
Give me an idea for all these keywords.

[01:03:51 - 01:03:52]
Let's copy it.

[01:03:52 - 01:03:57]
Let's paste it.

[01:03:57 - 01:03:59]
It has given me the idea of what I can do.

[01:04:00 - 01:04:03]
It has given me the idea of what I can do.

[01:04:03 - 01:04:07]
So I have picked up the top page of my competitor.

[01:04:07 - 01:04:09]
I have reverse engineered it.

[01:04:09 - 01:04:10]
I don't have to do it by myself.

[01:04:10 - 01:04:17]
It has given me the idea of what I can do.

[01:04:17 - 01:04:20]
If I want, I can get the content written on the same idea.

[01:04:20 - 01:04:22]
After that, I can publish the same content.

[01:04:22 - 01:04:24]
Again, I am not recommending it.

[01:04:24 - 01:04:27]
But I can revamp the same content and publish it on my

[01:04:27 - 01:04:28]
website.

[01:04:28 - 01:04:33]
I hope you have understood how you can do SEO using chat.

[01:04:33 - 01:04:36]
If you don't know how to do SEO, don't worry.

[01:04:36 - 01:04:40]
My logic was to make you a prompting expert.

[01:04:40 - 01:04:43]
You have understood the techniques and what all we can do

[01:04:43 - 01:04:43]
with it.

[01:04:43 - 01:04:45]
And your mind should open up.

[01:04:45 - 01:04:47]
We are going to take multiple examples in this course.

[01:04:47 - 01:04:50]
Consider those examples as a method.

[01:04:50 - 01:04:52]
I am teaching you that method.

[01:04:52 - 01:04:55]
So that you can practice things and understand how to

[01:04:55 - 01:04:56]
become a prompt.

[01:04:57 - 01:04:58]
How to work as a prompt.

[01:04:58 - 01:05:04]
What are the problems and how to resolve them.

[01:05:04 - 01:05:06]
Now let's talk about email marketing.

[01:05:06 - 01:05:12]
How can we become an email marketing expert using chat GPT.

[01:05:12 - 01:05:15]
If you do email marketing in chat GPT, you don't have to

[01:05:15 - 01:05:16]
worry about SEO.

[01:05:16 - 01:05:18]
That Google will catch you.

[01:05:18 - 01:05:20]
If you steal, you will be caught.

[01:05:20 - 01:05:23]
Chat GPT is like copywriting.

[01:05:23 - 01:05:26]
And you have to do copywriting in email marketing.

[01:05:27 - 01:05:29]
Let's generate some ideas.

[01:05:29 - 01:05:31]
How can we generate ideas.

[01:05:31 - 01:05:36]
You can follow my copywriting methodology.

[01:05:36 - 01:05:42]
If you follow it, you will know your style and tone.

[01:05:42 - 01:05:46]
But for now, I will show you the prompts.

[01:05:46 - 01:05:49]
And I will show you what all we can do in chat GPT.

[01:05:49 - 01:05:54]
Generate an email subject line for newsletter promoting

[01:05:54 - 01:05:56]
digital marketing.

[01:05:56 - 01:05:58]
It gave me some ideas.

[01:05:58 - 01:06:01]
The prompt is a little vague.

[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]
Let's explain it to the audience.

[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]
And try to make it better.

[01:06:05 - 01:06:12]
Generate 5 email campaign ideas for digital marketing

[01:06:12 - 01:06:16]
agency targeting grocery shop owners.

[01:06:16 - 01:06:17]
This is good.

[01:06:17 - 01:06:20]
Now we have told our audience.

[01:06:20 - 01:06:23]
We have kept the context while prompting.

[01:06:23 - 01:06:24]
Now we have written the heading.

[01:06:24 - 01:06:27]
Let's write the content.

[01:06:28 - 01:06:31]
Generate an email template for a welcome email.

[01:06:31 - 01:06:42]
Including personalized message, social links, and special

[01:06:42 - 01:06:43]
offer.

[01:06:43 - 01:06:46]
You can see that he has made a personalized email.

[01:06:46 - 01:06:48]
He didn't mention the industry niche.

[01:06:48 - 01:06:54]
If we want, we can add a layer of description.

[01:06:54 - 01:06:56]
We have just told him to make it.

[01:06:56 - 01:06:58]
We didn't keep the context.

[01:06:58 - 01:06:59]
What is our business?

[01:06:59 - 01:07:00]
What do we do?

[01:07:00 - 01:07:05]
Generate a personalized email for a customer who recently

[01:07:05 - 01:07:07]
purchased my graphic designing course.

[01:07:07 - 01:07:10]
Selling prompt engineer course with a special offer.

[01:07:10 - 01:07:16]
The one who has taken my previous course, let's show him

[01:07:16 - 01:07:18]
the new course.

[01:07:18 - 01:07:20]
He has told me the subject line.

[01:07:20 - 01:07:23]
He has also told me what has happened and what hasn't.

[01:07:23 - 01:07:25]
And he has written the whole content.

[01:07:27 - 01:07:30]
If you see below, he has made a promo code for me.

[01:07:30 - 01:07:40]
And he has made the whole description.

[01:07:41 - 01:07:44]
If you read it, I can see a lot of value.

[01:07:44 - 01:07:46]
Yes, I don't have it in my tone.

[01:07:46 - 01:07:48]
So I can convert it in my tone.

[01:07:48 - 01:07:50]
Now we have written the normal email.

[01:07:50 - 01:07:52]
Now let's write a call to action email.

[01:07:52 - 01:07:55]
The one who has subscribed to my email, let's try to sell

[01:07:55 - 01:07:56]
him something.

[01:07:56 - 01:07:59]
Generate a copy of an email promoting a limited time offer

[01:07:59 - 01:08:01]
on a Canva designing course.

[01:08:01 - 01:08:14]
Including a strong call to action.

[01:08:14 - 01:08:16]
Now he has made it and given it to me.

[01:08:16 - 01:08:19]
But ideally, I believe that if you want to make something

[01:08:19 - 01:08:20]
of this type.

[01:08:21 - 01:08:24]
Which we have learned in the framework, the learning method.

[01:08:24 - 01:08:29]
So first teach him who we are, what is our course, what do

[01:08:29 - 01:08:30]
we do.

[01:08:30 - 01:08:32]
So that he gets to know the whole detail about our business.

[01:08:32 - 01:08:34]
About the offering of our product.

[01:08:34 - 01:08:36]
So that he can craft it properly.

[01:08:36 - 01:08:39]
Now he has crafted it. If you see, it is good.

[01:08:39 - 01:08:41]
I am not saying that he has made it wrong.

[01:08:41 - 01:08:43]
He has told me what all things we have talked about.

[01:08:43 - 01:08:46]
Visual branding and we have talked about all these things.

[01:08:46 - 01:08:49]
And if I had told him my USPs in a better way earlier.

[01:08:49 - 01:08:51]
Then he could have written it in a better way.

[01:08:51 - 01:08:53]
So now let's make an email for an abundant cart.

[01:08:53 - 01:08:55]
What does abundant cart mean?

[01:08:55 - 01:08:57]
If you go to an e-commerce site.

[01:08:57 - 01:08:59]
You add to cart, but do not take the product.

[01:08:59 - 01:09:00]
Then the mail goes.

[01:09:00 - 01:09:02]
You saw about this product.

[01:09:02 - 01:09:03]
But you did not take it.

[01:09:03 - 01:09:04]
Why did it happen?

[01:09:04 - 01:09:05]
What happened?

[01:09:05 - 01:09:06]
What did not happen?

[01:09:06 - 01:09:07]
So this is an abundant cart.

[01:09:07 - 01:09:10]
So how can we create an email for an abundant cart?

[01:09:10 - 01:09:13]
Generate a template for abundant cart email.

[01:09:14 - 01:09:16]
Including a personalized message and a special offer.

[01:09:16 - 01:09:19]
So basically if someone has added to cart and not taken it.

[01:09:19 - 01:09:21]
So the way to convince him is the offer.

[01:09:21 - 01:09:23]
That brother, take this discount.

[01:09:23 - 01:09:25]
You must have seen many times that Amazon does this.

[01:09:25 - 01:09:29]
Let's see what he has done.

[01:09:29 - 01:09:32]
Here product 1 description, product 2 description, product

[01:09:32 - 01:09:33]
3 description.

[01:09:33 - 01:09:35]
So basically he gave an idea.

[01:09:35 - 01:09:37]
What products can you put here?

[01:09:37 - 01:09:39]
If I tell you honestly.

[01:09:39 - 01:09:41]
The things we are doing in email marketing.

[01:09:41 - 01:09:44]
These were things of an advanced level.

[01:09:45 - 01:09:47]
We had to think many times.

[01:09:47 - 01:09:49]
There were many iterations.

[01:09:49 - 01:09:51]
If we design an email campaign.

[01:09:51 - 01:09:53]
Normally if I talk and go.

[01:09:53 - 01:09:55]
When I used to be a marketing head.

[01:09:55 - 01:09:57]
So we designed an email campaign of 30 days.

[01:09:57 - 01:09:59]
And all these small things happened.

[01:09:59 - 01:10:02]
By adding to cart. If we have to take out promotional,

[01:10:02 - 01:10:04]
Diwali offer, this and that

[01:10:04 - 01:10:08]
It used to take us a lot of time We used to be a big team

[01:10:08 - 01:10:08]
just for this

[01:10:08 - 01:10:12]
But today in just a few minutes it is doing that work for

[01:10:12 - 01:10:12]
you

[01:10:12 - 01:10:15]
And I will say that in many cases it is doing better than

[01:10:15 - 01:10:15]
humans

[01:10:15 - 01:10:18]
It is doing efficient, in less time

[01:10:18 - 01:10:20]
And it is doing in my tone

[01:10:20 - 01:10:23]
Many times what used to happen is that I as a marketer

[01:10:23 - 01:10:25]
I don't like to write email that much

[01:10:25 - 01:10:26]
But I know what to write

[01:10:26 - 01:10:29]
But the content writer whom I am making him write, he is

[01:10:29 - 01:10:30]
writing something else

[01:10:30 - 01:10:31]
Then I am telling him to do something like this

[01:10:31 - 01:10:32]
Then he is writing

[01:10:32 - 01:10:35]
Then I am saying something else Then I am proofreading it

[01:10:35 - 01:10:37]
English is correct, grammar is correct, this is not

[01:10:37 - 01:10:37]
correct, that is not correct

[01:10:37 - 01:10:40]
Now, in just a matter of seconds, it can accomplish the

[01:10:40 - 01:10:42]
same task that previously required a person. I used to

[01:10:42 - 01:10:44]
instruct them on what to do.

[01:10:44 - 01:10:44]
No, do this

[01:10:44 - 01:10:45]
It is doing that

[01:10:45 - 01:10:48]
So now let's make Drip Email Sequence

[01:10:48 - 01:10:49]
Now what is Drip Email Sequence?

[01:10:49 - 01:10:53]
On Day 1, this mail goes On Day 2, this mail goes On Day 3,

[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]
this mail goes

[01:10:54 - 01:10:56]
And what will go in the first mail, what will go in the

[01:10:56 - 01:10:57]
second, what will go in the third

[01:10:57 - 01:10:59]
I used to think a lot

[01:10:59 - 01:11:01]
Let's make him do it once and see how he does it

[01:11:01 - 01:11:04]
Generate a 3 email automation sequence for digital

[01:11:04 - 01:11:04]
marketing company

[01:11:04 - 01:11:08]
Targeting new subscribers Including a welcome email and a

[01:11:08 - 01:11:10]
product recommendation email

[01:11:10 - 01:11:11]
I entered

[01:11:11 - 01:11:15]
So he has made the first mail for me The second mail that

[01:11:15 - 01:11:19]
he is making is of product recommendation

[01:11:19 - 01:11:22]
So he is making the product recommendation for me

[01:11:22 - 01:11:24]
That what benefits are going to be there

[01:11:24 - 01:11:27]
Now you can see, he is doing benefit 1, 2, 3 in this way

[01:11:27 - 01:11:30]
If I have already explained this about my business

[01:11:30 - 01:11:33]
Then he will not do benefit 1, 2, 3, he will write the

[01:11:33 - 01:11:34]
benefit for you

[01:11:34 - 01:11:37]
And finally, he is making additional resources about the

[01:11:37 - 01:11:39]
follow up mail that is going to be sent

[01:11:39 - 01:11:40]
Now I have written the email

[01:11:40 - 01:11:42]
So now let's go to a little advanced level

[01:11:42 - 01:11:44]
The headings that we are writing for example

[01:11:44 - 01:11:47]
Now we put a little more context on the heading

[01:11:47 - 01:11:50]
Till now we have said, heading for this, heading for this,

[01:11:50 - 01:11:50]
heading for this

[01:11:51 - 01:11:55]
Now I want to put my own spin on it and make it sound like

[01:11:55 - 01:11:59]
me. Let's come up with a subject line and email copy that

[01:11:59 - 01:12:03]
will really sell our home decor products, using strong

[01:12:03 - 01:12:05]
language and persuasive words.

[01:12:05 - 01:12:07]
What are power words?

[01:12:07 - 01:12:08]
Like free

[01:12:08 - 01:12:11]
There are a lot of words that can affect people's

[01:12:11 - 01:12:15]
subconscious and catch their attention. But in the past,

[01:12:15 - 01:12:18]
you had to memorize a lot of power words.

[01:12:18 - 01:12:22]
Or you had to search which power word can I use for this

[01:12:22 - 01:12:22]
case

[01:12:22 - 01:12:24]
Here I just have to write power word, he will do it

[01:12:24 - 01:12:27]
And I have written my style, I want compelling language

[01:12:27 - 01:12:37]
Entered and he made it for me

[01:12:37 - 01:12:39]
With a true heart, keep your hand on your heart and tell

[01:12:39 - 01:12:44]
Can we do the level of copywriting that he is doing so fast?

[01:12:44 - 01:12:46]
Yes, we could do it, if we had put some brain and worked

[01:12:46 - 01:12:47]
hard

[01:12:47 - 01:12:50]
Here he is creating 10 options in 1 second

[01:12:50 - 01:12:52]
Which is next level thing

[01:12:52 - 01:12:55]
Now let's make a drip email campaign And in drip email

[01:12:55 - 01:12:58]
campaign, I am providing some more context

[01:12:58 - 01:13:02]
Create a drip email campaign consisting of 5 emails for a

[01:13:02 - 01:13:05]
software company that caters to small business owners. The

[01:13:05 - 01:13:09]
campaign should include tips and best practices for using

[01:13:09 - 01:13:12]
the product. As per his suggestion, the first email should

[01:13:12 - 01:13:14]
be a welcome email.

[01:13:14 - 01:13:17]
In welcome email, we will talk about all these things

[01:13:17 - 01:13:22]
After that, second email is telling that essential feature

[01:13:22 - 01:13:24]
of getting started

[01:13:24 - 01:13:28]
Features are being explained, what are the features of our

[01:13:28 - 01:13:32]
product After that, tips and tricks are being explained

[01:13:32 - 01:13:35]
How you can save time by using our tool

[01:13:35 - 01:13:40]
Here you can see, tip description, tip 1, tip 2 description

[01:13:40 - 01:13:43]
If you have written a good context Right now, I have just

[01:13:43 - 01:13:45]
given a basic level

[01:13:45 - 01:13:47]
If I have told what is my business

[01:13:47 - 01:13:49]
I have just written software company

[01:13:49 - 01:13:52]
If I would have told what is my software company

[01:13:52 - 01:13:54]
Which product I sell, what are its features

[01:13:54 - 01:13:57]
So this tips and tricks are not coming like this

[01:13:57 - 01:13:59]
It gives me data

[01:13:59 - 01:14:01]
See, it stopped here

[01:14:01 - 01:14:02]
Why it stopped?

[01:14:02 - 01:14:06]
Basically, once the limit of writing is crossed

[01:14:06 - 01:14:10]
So what is one way of this? You go here and write continue

[01:14:10 - 01:14:18]
We hit enter See, now it started writing

[01:14:18 - 01:14:21]
So again, by making 4 emails, he gave so fast

[01:14:21 - 01:14:23]
I couldn't make it so fast

[01:14:23 - 01:14:26]
I mean, I couldn't do it 10, 20, 30 times faster

[01:14:26 - 01:14:28]
And this is efficient

[01:14:28 - 01:14:31]
This is not that work is happening fast, so it's okay, pull

[01:14:31 - 01:14:31]
it

[01:14:31 - 01:14:33]
Again, I am writing one more email

[01:14:33 - 01:14:35]
I am writing single, I am not writing sequence

[01:14:35 - 01:14:37]
I am writing a single email

[01:14:37 - 01:14:39]
But I am adding some more context in it

[01:14:39 - 01:14:41]
What is my business, what are my product services

[01:14:41 - 01:14:43]
And what all I need in the mail

[01:14:43 - 01:14:46]
Generate an email copy for a black friday sale

[01:14:46 - 01:14:48]

[01:15:22 - 01:15:24]
Then below will be your email id and this

[01:15:24 - 01:15:26]
So here my logic of explaining context

[01:15:26 - 01:15:30]
According to me, you must have started to understand

[01:15:30 - 01:15:33]
That by adding context, how much difference does it make in

[01:15:33 - 01:15:34]
the quality of mail

[01:15:34 - 01:15:36]
Now let's do some complex prompting

[01:15:36 - 01:15:38]
Let's test it, whether it will be able to do it or not

[01:15:38 - 01:15:41]
Generate an email campaign for a restaurant chain targeting

[01:15:41 - 01:15:43]
customer in different cities

[01:15:43 - 01:15:47]
Including location or specific deals

[01:15:47 - 01:15:53]
He made it location specific

[01:15:53 - 01:15:57]
Exclusive offer, city name will be written here Restaurant

[01:15:57 - 01:15:58]
name will be written here

[01:15:58 - 01:16:03]
Subscriber name will be written here

[01:16:03 - 01:16:08]
How much discount are we giving I was expecting something

[01:16:08 - 01:16:09]
like this

[01:16:09 - 01:16:11]
And according to me, it is very good

[01:16:11 - 01:16:13]
Now what you have to do

[01:16:13 - 01:16:15]
According to me, I have explained the whole context of

[01:16:15 - 01:16:16]
email marketing

[01:16:16 - 01:16:19]
How you can do email marketing

[01:16:19 - 01:16:24]
Which mails can be generated from this And how the context

[01:16:24 - 01:16:24]
is kept

[01:16:24 - 01:16:26]
If you want to come up with a subject line, here's how to

[01:16:26 - 01:16:28]
do it. If you want to write the body of the email, here's

[01:16:28 - 01:16:30]
how to do it. And if you want to send a drip email, here's

[01:16:30 - 01:16:30]
how to do it.

[01:16:30 - 01:16:32]
Now try something like this

[01:16:32 - 01:16:34]
Write an email from this

[01:16:34 - 01:16:36]
For a specific xyz product

[01:16:36 - 01:16:39]
And highlight features in it

[01:16:39 - 01:16:41]
Talk about loyalty program

[01:16:41 - 01:16:43]
Add testimonials

[01:16:43 - 01:16:45]
Add reviews

[01:16:45 - 01:16:47]
Think about few more things

[01:16:47 - 01:16:49]
And then ask him whether he can do it or not

[01:16:49 - 01:16:51]
So we will not take this video long

[01:16:51 - 01:16:53]
We will end it here

[01:16:53 - 01:16:56]
Now you try by creating different types of emails

[01:16:56 - 01:16:59]
Open your email box and see how many emails you have

[01:16:59 - 01:17:02]
And try to generate similar emails

[01:17:02 - 01:17:06]
As you practice, you will understand the prompting in the

[01:17:06 - 01:17:06]
same way

[01:17:06 - 01:17:13]
This video is going to be for job seekers

[01:17:13 - 01:17:15]
If you want to take a job

[01:17:15 - 01:17:17]
Then this video will help you

[01:17:17 - 01:17:20]
How you can take a job from chat gpt

[01:17:20 - 01:17:23]
How chat gpt can help you to get a job

[01:17:23 - 01:17:26]
And you can also sell this business

[01:17:26 - 01:17:28]
You can make resumes of people

[01:17:28 - 01:17:29]
You can modify people's resumes

[01:17:29 - 01:17:30]
You can make it better

[01:17:30 - 01:17:33]
First of all, let's understand what is resume

[01:17:33 - 01:17:36]
And how to apply for a job

[01:17:36 - 01:17:39]
First of all, a company posts its job

[01:17:39 - 01:17:42]
And it writes that we need this type of person

[01:17:42 - 01:17:44]
And this specification should be there

[01:17:44 - 01:17:47]
This specification is called job description in technical

[01:17:47 - 01:17:48]
terms

[01:17:48 - 01:17:50]
And there is a role written there

[01:17:50 - 01:17:51]
For which role they are doing

[01:17:51 - 01:17:53]
Like digital marketing head

[01:17:53 - 01:17:54]
Sales executive

[01:17:54 - 01:17:55]
Dash executive

[01:17:55 - 01:17:58]
This role is called title

[01:17:58 - 01:17:59]
Job title

[01:17:59 - 01:18:01]
And normally if we talk about a resume

[01:18:01 - 01:18:03]
There are few parts in it

[01:18:03 - 01:18:05]
First of all, there is a heading

[01:18:05 - 01:18:07]
There is a compelling heading

[01:18:07 - 01:18:10]
Because of which the other person is attracted to that

[01:18:10 - 01:18:10]
resume

[01:18:10 - 01:18:12]
Second, there is a summary

[01:18:12 - 01:18:14]
Third, there is your experience

[01:18:14 - 01:18:17]
Fourth, what you have done in life

[01:18:17 - 01:18:19]
What are the highlights of your life

[01:18:19 - 01:18:21]
Which makes you different

[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]
Which makes you fit for that role

[01:18:23 - 01:18:25]
After that, there are contact details

[01:18:25 - 01:18:28]
If we normally talk about a resume

[01:18:28 - 01:18:30]
Whenever we submit a resume

[01:18:30 - 01:18:32]
We have to mail it

[01:18:32 - 01:18:34]
We call it cover letter

[01:18:34 - 01:18:36]
I am telling you all the technical words

[01:18:36 - 01:18:39]
While prompting, you should know these technical words

[01:18:39 - 01:18:42]
Because you don't know what you have to write

[01:18:42 - 01:18:44]
So how chatgpt will help you

[01:18:44 - 01:18:49]
So the cover letter is about you It is basically a mail

[01:18:49 - 01:18:51]
In which your resume is attached

[01:18:51 - 01:18:54]
And it is how you can help a company

[01:18:54 - 01:18:58]
And lastly, if your resume is made Then AI can help you

[01:18:58 - 01:19:02]
improve it It can correct its grammatical mistakes

[01:19:02 - 01:19:03]
And if there is any spelling mistake

[01:19:03 - 01:19:06]
It can help for that too So first of all, let's make a

[01:19:06 - 01:19:07]
resume title

[01:19:07 - 01:19:09]
If I talk about myself

[01:19:09 - 01:19:11]
I used to play with titles a lot

[01:19:11 - 01:19:13]
Whenever I got a job

[01:19:13 - 01:19:17]
My resume used to be according to that job

[01:19:17 - 01:19:19]
My resume was never generic

[01:19:19 - 01:19:22]
In those days, I had to write the content myself

[01:19:22 - 01:19:25]
But today, content can be written by chatgpt For that

[01:19:25 - 01:19:27]
specific job profile

[01:19:27 - 01:19:29]
So that when someone reads it

[01:19:29 - 01:19:33]
They feel that this person is a match for our company

[01:19:33 - 01:19:35]
So what I have done here Write as you may for

[01:19:35 - 01:19:37]
Here my profile will come

[01:19:37 - 01:19:38]
The profile for which I am applying

[01:19:38 - 01:19:39]
Digital marketing head

[01:19:39 - 01:19:41]
For this job description

[01:19:41 - 01:19:43]
Now I will put the job description here

[01:19:43 - 01:19:48]
So many people must have put jobs Like I think this is right

[01:19:48 - 01:19:57]
It has become too long if we see

[01:20:13 - 01:20:17]
So here you can see, it has started making resume for us

[01:20:17 - 01:20:19]
I will create a resume for the position of digital

[01:20:19 - 01:20:22]
marketing head which will include my name, email,

[01:20:22 - 01:20:25]
objective, summary, and key skills. I will also list my

[01:20:25 - 01:20:28]
professional experience and roles. Essentially, I provided

[01:20:28 - 01:20:31]
the job description and used it to create the resume.

[01:20:31 - 01:20:32]
from that

[01:20:32 - 01:20:35]
That's it, I can modify it according to me and now I am

[01:20:35 - 01:20:39]
going to tell you more prompts so that I can make it better

[01:20:39 - 01:20:42]
Now I am assuming it as a use case because one important

[01:20:42 - 01:20:43]
thing is coming here

[01:20:43 - 01:20:47]
Sometimes the content which you have to tell in job

[01:20:47 - 01:20:49]
description is very big

[01:20:49 - 01:20:51]
And if you will put here then it will say that it is out of

[01:20:51 - 01:20:53]
my reach, it is too much content

[01:20:53 - 01:20:55]
So what is the solution for this?

[01:20:55 - 01:20:58]
The solution for this is you have to make a new chat

[01:20:58 - 01:21:01]
prompt, paste it there, paste and enter

[01:21:01 - 01:21:05]
After entering, it will make a summary of the whole content

[01:21:05 - 01:21:08]
So here it has made a whole summary, what is job title,

[01:21:08 - 01:21:10]
what is the description, etc

[01:21:10 - 01:21:13]
So the whole content which we have copied and pasted, it

[01:21:13 - 01:21:17]
has made it in improved format and in less pieces

[01:21:17 - 01:21:19]
Now I can copy and paste it again and make resume

[01:21:19 - 01:21:20]
Ideally, I would have preferred to complete it by now.

[01:21:20 - 01:21:22]
However, if it's not possible, I can explore alternative

[01:21:22 - 01:21:23]
ways to get it done.

[01:21:23 - 01:21:25]
Now let's do it in a different way

[01:21:25 - 01:21:27]
So now we have summarized the job description, I will write

[01:21:27 - 01:21:28]
below that

[01:21:28 - 01:21:30]
For the above job description, write a resume for digital

[01:21:30 - 01:21:32]
marketing head position at Wipro

[01:21:32 - 01:21:39]
Include bullet points, achievement that shows impact

[01:21:39 - 01:21:41]
matrices

[01:21:41 - 01:21:44]
So here you will see that it is doing the same thing which

[01:21:44 - 01:21:46]
it was doing before

[01:21:46 - 01:21:48]
So here we have changed the context a little and there we

[01:21:48 - 01:21:50]
have changed the context a little

[01:21:50 - 01:21:53]
So you have two ways to make a resume

[01:21:53 - 01:21:57]
Now let's try to improve this resume

[01:21:58 - 01:22:01]
I am asking you to tell me what skills should I include in

[01:22:01 - 01:22:02]
my resume

[01:22:02 - 01:22:05]
What skills should I include in my resume for this job

[01:22:05 - 01:22:06]
profile

[01:22:22 - 01:22:25]
So it has given me some key points on which I can work in

[01:22:25 - 01:22:26]
my resume

[01:22:26 - 01:22:29]
Now I would like to tell you two simple things

[01:22:29 - 01:22:32]
Don't copy and paste the whole resume from here

[01:22:32 - 01:22:35]
Because it is giving you an ideal format which should be

[01:22:35 - 01:22:35]
there

[01:22:35 - 01:22:38]
But in this, your hobbies should be original

[01:22:38 - 01:22:42]
The work that you have done in your life should be the same

[01:22:42 - 01:22:45]
The simple thing is that I have done 10 things in my life

[01:22:45 - 01:22:47]
I can't write those 10 things in my resume

[01:22:47 - 01:22:50]
I have to write those 3 things which the other person has

[01:22:50 - 01:22:51]
to know from me

[01:22:51 - 01:22:55]
Now the problem is that I don't know what to write in my

[01:22:55 - 01:22:57]
resume which the HR is looking for

[01:22:57 - 01:23:01]
So this process is helping you to find those things

[01:23:01 - 01:23:04]
It is not helping you to make the whole resume

[01:23:04 - 01:23:06]
For this, I will tell you another tool

[01:23:06 - 01:23:09]
There is a website called TealHQ

[01:23:09 - 01:23:15]
If you see, they have their own AI resume builder You can

[01:23:15 - 01:23:21]
use this too and it can help you to make a good resume

[01:23:21 - 01:23:24]
But don't rely purely on this

[01:23:24 - 01:23:25]
Don't rely purely on GPT

[01:23:25 - 01:23:30]
Use your brain and try to improve it So what is my best way?

[01:23:30 - 01:23:35]
First make your resume on your level After that make it

[01:23:35 - 01:23:35]
from this

[01:23:35 - 01:23:37]
After that mix and match both

[01:23:37 - 01:23:41]
After that, ask them to improve it. But how can you improve

[01:23:41 - 01:23:45]
and solve grammatical problems? One easy way is to use

[01:23:45 - 01:23:46]
chatbots like GPT.

[01:23:46 - 01:23:48]
I am writing a prompt

[01:23:48 - 01:23:52]
Please proofread and edit this email slash resume It is

[01:23:52 - 01:23:52]
your wish

[01:23:52 - 01:23:56]
You can send the email or resume for any grammatical or

[01:23:56 - 01:23:57]
spelling mistake

[01:23:57 - 01:24:00]
I am doing the above because it is already made

[01:24:00 - 01:24:05]
But to explain you how it does it So proofread and

[01:24:05 - 01:24:07]
grammatical mistakes are removed

[01:24:07 - 01:24:09]
Now what is the final step?

[01:24:09 - 01:24:11]
Your resume is ready

[01:24:11 - 01:24:15]
Now you have to send the mail Watch the email marketing

[01:24:15 - 01:24:15]
video

[01:24:15 - 01:24:17]
You will understand better how to do it

[01:24:17 - 01:24:21]
But here we are going to send only one cover letter

[01:24:21 - 01:24:24]
Now what is that cover letter and how to generate it?

[01:24:24 - 01:24:25]
Let's see that

[01:24:25 - 01:24:27]
What I have done here?

[01:24:27 - 01:24:31]
Write a cover letter for job description as a marketing

[01:24:31 - 01:24:31]
manager

[01:24:31 - 01:24:33]
Above is my resume

[01:24:33 - 01:24:35]
You can write any profile instead of marketing manager

[01:24:35 - 01:24:40]
Enter it

[01:24:40 - 01:24:42]
And it is making it for me

[01:24:42 - 01:24:45]
Ideally I will say that you have to follow what we have

[01:24:45 - 01:24:46]
learnt in copywriting

[01:24:46 - 01:24:49]
You have to convert it in your style

[01:24:49 - 01:24:53]
So that you get the feeling of human and not AI 99% of the

[01:24:53 - 01:24:58]
time you will feel that it is best and you don't have to do

[01:24:58 - 01:24:59]
anything else

[01:24:59 - 01:25:03]
So I hope you have understood how to make a resume and

[01:25:03 - 01:25:04]
improve it

[01:25:04 - 01:25:06]
How to send a cover letter

[01:25:06 - 01:25:08]
Now let's come to the final step

[01:25:08 - 01:25:10]
How to do an interview?

[01:25:10 - 01:25:12]
There can be things related to interview

[01:25:12 - 01:25:16]
For this I have to go to my job description page

[01:25:16 - 01:25:25]
What kind of questions should I prepare for the interview

[01:25:25 - 01:25:31]
of the marketing head job description?

[01:25:31 - 01:25:34]
So I have done an anchoring from marketing head so that it

[01:25:34 - 01:25:36]
can know who I am talking about

[01:25:36 - 01:25:42]
So, it provides all the interview-related questions, and I

[01:25:42 - 01:25:48]
have obtained them. If needed, I can also find answers to

[01:25:48 - 01:25:50]
those questions.

[01:25:50 - 01:25:54]
Like what should be the ideal answer for this question?

[01:25:54 - 01:25:56]
What should be the ideal answer for this question?

[01:25:56 - 01:25:58]
What should be the ideal answer for this question?

[01:25:58 - 01:26:02]
Based on the context provided, it seems that the current

[01:26:02 - 01:26:05]
English translation is already contextual and modern. No

[01:26:05 - 01:26:06]
changes needed.

[01:26:06 - 01:26:08]
You have to be real

[01:26:08 - 01:26:12]
You have to be prepared and go And learn all those things

[01:26:12 - 01:26:13]
from chat gpt and go

[01:26:13 - 01:26:23]
You have to be honest and you have to know the answers

[01:26:23 - 01:26:25]
But don't get all the answers from chat gpt

[01:26:25 - 01:26:32]
All the best I hope you have understood this session

[01:26:32 - 01:26:35]
And you might have got some prompting ideas from this

[01:26:35 - 01:26:37]
I have also taught summarization

[01:26:42 - 01:26:45]
So let's talk about how you can use chat gpt to improve

[01:26:45 - 01:26:47]
your video editing

[01:26:47 - 01:26:49]
You can do video production

[01:26:49 - 01:26:51]
I am going to cover a lot of things

[01:26:51 - 01:26:54]
How you can make a script for a youtube channel

[01:26:54 - 01:26:56]
We will understand everything

[01:26:56 - 01:26:58]
I am not going to use any additional tool here

[01:26:58 - 01:27:01]
We are going to do this only by writing chat gpt prompts

[01:27:01 - 01:27:04]
First prompt is that I have a youtube channel and marketing

[01:27:04 - 01:27:05]
entrepreneurship

[01:27:05 - 01:27:07]
Give me some ideas

[01:27:07 - 01:27:10]
Prioritize those ideas which are uncommon and novel

[01:27:10 - 01:27:12]
Why I am focusing on uncommon

[01:27:12 - 01:27:14]
Because uncommon is more popular

[01:27:14 - 01:27:26]
I will enter

[01:27:26 - 01:27:29]
Give me some viral ideas

[01:27:29 - 01:27:36]
I am writing viral because I want some mass

[01:27:36 - 01:27:41]
Because the content he has given me is very good according

[01:27:41 - 01:27:42]
to my understanding

[01:27:42 - 01:27:45]
But I know that this type of content is not popular on

[01:27:45 - 01:27:45]
youtube

[01:27:45 - 01:27:49]
I also make videos on hardcore topics in intellectual indies

[01:27:49 - 01:27:54]
But I know that if I put a technical video then it doesn't

[01:27:54 - 01:27:54]
get views

[01:27:54 - 01:27:56]
If I put some mass content then it gets more views

[01:27:56 - 01:27:58]
So for now I am taking mass content

[01:27:58 - 01:28:02]
How to create mass content 10 shocking marketing fails that

[01:28:02 - 01:28:03]
you can learn from them

[01:28:03 - 01:28:05]
I like this one

[01:28:05 - 01:28:07]
Let's take this one

[01:28:07 - 01:28:10]
I am creating a youtube video on 10 shocking marketing fails

[01:28:10 - 01:28:12]
And what can I learn from them

[01:28:12 - 01:28:15]
Help me with the outline of the video script

[01:28:16 - 01:28:24]
If you have seen the SEO video then we are going to do the

[01:28:24 - 01:28:28]
same thing on the initial level

[01:28:28 - 01:28:32]
So, basically, he gave me an idea on how to structure the

[01:28:32 - 01:28:36]
content, but I'm not sure which marketing fails are the

[01:28:36 - 01:28:37]
most shocking.

[01:28:37 - 01:28:44]
So what I will say is tell me 10 shocking marketing fails

[01:28:44 - 01:28:46]
So he told me

[01:28:46 - 01:28:48]
New coke was launched in 1985

[01:28:48 - 01:28:50]
And it was a big blunder

[01:28:50 - 01:28:53]
Pepsi had added with Kendall Jenner

[01:28:54 - 01:28:56]
He is adding many more options

[01:28:56 - 01:28:58]
So I have got the options and the script

[01:28:58 - 01:29:00]
So now I am saying create a video script for me

[01:29:00 - 01:29:11]
So I am going up

[01:29:11 - 01:29:14]
Great Basically I am praising him because when AI will rule

[01:29:14 - 01:29:15]
us in the future

[01:29:15 - 01:29:18]
So it's better to start praising him now

[01:29:18 - 01:29:25]
Create a youtube video script on the above marketing fails

[01:29:25 - 01:29:27]
in the below format

[01:29:27 - 01:29:29]
I will pick the format from here

[01:29:29 - 01:29:40]
Which he gave me I have asked the format from here And

[01:29:40 - 01:29:45]
asked the topic from here

[01:29:45 - 01:29:47]
I have asked all the parts of the topic from here

[01:29:47 - 01:29:51]
And I have made the script from the strategy of that topic

[01:29:51 - 01:29:53]
Now I have made the script

[01:29:53 - 01:29:57]
Next step is I have to give emotions in this script

[01:29:57 - 01:29:59]
I have to give my own emotions basically

[01:30:00 - 01:30:03]
I will tell you my personality

[01:30:03 - 01:30:06]
I don't want to go back to those steps

[01:30:06 - 01:30:09]
How to make it more conversational

[01:30:09 - 01:30:12]
How to make it more humorous

[01:30:12 - 01:30:15]
Make it more conversational

[01:30:15 - 01:30:17]
Make it more humorous. Make it dash. Make it dash. Make it

[01:30:17 - 01:30:18]
dash.

[01:30:18 - 01:30:21]
Let's do it again

[01:30:21 - 01:30:35]
We should not do this Introduction. Fail no.1 So basically

[01:30:35 - 01:30:50]
he is not able to make it for me So I have to do something

[01:30:50 - 01:30:59]
else I have to combine two prompts

[01:30:59 - 01:31:02]
How to combine two prompts

[01:31:02 - 01:31:12]
Tell me in history.

[01:31:14 - 01:31:17]
Let's see what he is doing

[01:31:17 - 01:31:20]
Now he understood what I want

[01:31:20 - 01:31:23]
Now I will make his video script

[01:31:23 - 01:31:26]
Make a YouTube video script on above marketing phase

[01:31:26 - 01:31:29]
Make it conversational and witty

[01:31:29 - 01:31:32]
So I have added my personal type

[01:31:32 - 01:31:43]
And he is convincing me Now I have the script

[01:31:43 - 01:31:46]
Next step is to shoot a video on it

[01:31:46 - 01:31:52]
I have two ways to shoot a video One is word by word

[01:31:52 - 01:31:55]
Which is written here

[01:31:55 - 01:32:01]
If you are saying same to same It will be easy

[01:32:01 - 01:32:04]
But if you are like me

[01:32:04 - 01:32:07]
You express your feelings

[01:32:07 - 01:32:10]
It will be easier

[01:32:10 - 01:32:13]
Let's say this is your script

[01:32:13 - 01:32:16]
What you have to do around this

[01:32:16 - 01:32:19]
You have covered only two fails

[01:32:19 - 01:32:22]
I need 10

[01:32:22 - 01:32:25]
Basically he has done only two

[01:32:25 - 01:32:28]
So basically what we are doing here

[01:32:28 - 01:32:31]
I am teaching you a new special type of prompt

[01:32:31 - 01:32:34]
We are iterating

[01:32:34 - 01:32:37]
We are adding a prompt

[01:32:37 - 01:32:40]
Then we are doing something else

[01:32:40 - 01:32:43]
I am teaching you my method

[01:32:43 - 01:32:46]
Sometimes when you don't get results

[01:32:46 - 01:32:49]
What should you do

[01:32:49 - 01:32:52]
Let's say he has clicked our video script

[01:32:52 - 01:32:55]
And I am doing word to word

[01:32:55 - 01:32:58]
So what I have to do

[01:32:58 - 01:33:01]
Please give me ideas to edit this video

[01:33:01 - 01:33:04]
Please help me

[01:33:04 - 01:33:07]
In the screenplay

[01:33:07 - 01:33:10]
Of this video script

[01:33:10 - 01:33:13]
What is screenplay

[01:33:13 - 01:33:16]
Screenplay is a technical word

[01:33:16 - 01:33:19]
When a movie is made

[01:33:19 - 01:33:22]
He is helping you

[01:33:22 - 01:33:29]
He is showing you

[01:33:29 - 01:33:32]
Host is energetic, charismatic

[01:33:32 - 01:33:37]
Professional looking backdrop

[01:33:37 - 01:33:43]
He is telling you how to do This is the best way

[01:33:43 - 01:33:46]
Let's say I am not doing word to word scripting

[01:33:46 - 01:33:49]
Let's say there is a case

[01:33:49 - 01:33:52]
Where you don't want to do word to word

[01:33:52 - 01:33:58]
I don't know what to talk about But I am doing it live

[01:33:58 - 01:34:01]
Now what I can do

[01:34:01 - 01:34:07]
I have to take an online tool Which can subtitle my video

[01:34:07 - 01:34:10]
You have two ways

[01:34:10 - 01:34:13]
I like to use AI tool

[01:34:13 - 01:34:19]
Because they are doing it right 90-95% accuracy

[01:34:19 - 01:34:22]
And you have done the subtitle

[01:34:22 - 01:34:25]
I am not teaching you how to do it

[01:34:25 - 01:34:31]
Now you have to copy the subtitle Like we did before

[01:34:31 - 01:34:34]
I will go to youtube

[01:34:34 - 01:34:37]
Click on three dots

[01:34:37 - 01:34:41]
Show transcription

[01:34:41 - 01:34:44]
Let's make a new chat

[01:34:44 - 01:34:47]
This is the script of my video

[01:34:48 - 01:34:51]
You are not following the script

[01:34:51 - 01:34:54]
You didn't follow the screenplay

[01:34:54 - 01:34:57]
You made the video from your heart

[01:34:57 - 01:35:00]
Now we can do something in editing

[01:35:00 - 01:35:03]
We had an option

[01:35:03 - 01:35:06]
We can shoot the camera

[01:35:06 - 01:35:09]
We can change the location

[01:35:09 - 01:35:12]
We can change the camera angle

[01:35:12 - 01:35:15]
But we don't have that option

[01:35:15 - 01:35:18]
I have to take the script

[01:35:18 - 01:35:21]
Help me in editing it

[01:35:21 - 01:35:26]
Enter it

[01:35:26 - 01:35:33]
Now it is making it for me In scene 1, we are talking about

[01:35:33 - 01:35:34]
lack of planning

[01:35:34 - 01:35:45]
In scene 4, we are talking about this In scene 5, we are

[01:35:45 - 01:35:51]
talking about this Let's do it

[01:35:51 - 01:35:54]
Me with the B rolls of this video

[01:35:55 - 01:36:02]
Now I said

[01:36:02 - 01:36:05]
Help me in B roll

[01:36:05 - 01:36:08]
Normally, the editors don't know

[01:36:08 - 01:36:11]
What to put on the video

[01:36:11 - 01:36:14]
I have to put a stock video

[01:36:14 - 01:36:17]
What should be the stock video

[01:36:17 - 01:36:20]
We call that video B roll

[01:36:20 - 01:36:23]
I am telling you technical words

[01:36:23 - 01:36:26]
Because if you use technical words

[01:36:27 - 01:36:30]
If you don't know the technical words

[01:36:30 - 01:36:33]
You have to work hard

[01:36:33 - 01:36:36]
It has told us what videos we can use

[01:36:36 - 01:36:39]
Lack of planning

[01:36:39 - 01:36:42]
Footage of a person sitting in a desk

[01:36:42 - 01:36:45]
Brainstorming and writing in a notebook

[01:36:45 - 01:36:48]
Timelapse of someone creating a detailed business plan

[01:36:48 - 01:36:51]
If you copy this

[01:36:51 - 01:36:54]
And go to the stock video

[01:36:55 - 01:36:58]
You have to look for it

[01:36:58 - 01:37:01]
Let's try something new

[01:37:01 - 01:37:04]
Let's put some context

[01:37:04 - 01:37:07]
Who is my target audience

[01:37:07 - 01:37:10]
Write a video script for make money online

[01:37:10 - 01:37:13]
With chatbots

[01:37:13 - 01:37:16]
What is the goal of the content

[01:37:16 - 01:37:19]
You have to be clear

[01:37:19 - 01:37:22]
You have to be concise, down to earth

[01:37:22 - 01:37:29]
Let's enter

[01:37:29 - 01:37:32]
It is making it for me

[01:37:32 - 01:37:35]
I can follow it

[01:37:35 - 01:37:38]
If you hit and try

[01:37:38 - 01:37:41]
You will know the script is good

[01:37:41 - 01:37:44]
We talked about content

[01:37:44 - 01:37:47]
Script is good

[01:37:47 - 01:37:50]
It is scary for content creators

[01:37:50 - 01:37:53]
If AI is able to write good content

[01:37:53 - 01:37:56]
Let's talk about case study content

[01:37:56 - 01:37:59]
If you make content with research

[01:37:59 - 01:38:02]
It will make better content than you

[01:38:02 - 01:38:05]
What is your courage

[01:38:05 - 01:38:08]
AI is growing

[01:38:08 - 01:38:11]
Research content will be obsolete in SEO

[01:38:11 - 01:38:14]
And youtube

[01:38:14 - 01:38:17]
People will keep watching

[01:38:17 - 01:38:20]
But AI will come

[01:38:21 - 01:38:24]
We have a long script

[01:38:24 - 01:38:27]
Let's do one thing

[01:38:27 - 01:38:30]
Short content

[01:38:30 - 01:38:33]
I can make big content

[01:38:33 - 01:38:36]
But making small content is dangerous

[01:38:36 - 01:38:39]
Instagram reels

[01:38:39 - 01:38:42]
I don't understand

[01:38:42 - 01:38:45]
Let's make a short video

[01:38:45 - 01:38:48]
Help me in creating 10 creative short videos

[01:38:48 - 01:38:51]
My business owner

[01:38:51 - 01:38:54]
My goal and writing style

[01:38:54 - 01:39:04]
I liked this

[01:39:04 - 01:39:07]
Effective time management strategy

[01:39:07 - 01:39:10]
I liked this topic

[01:39:10 - 01:39:13]
Give me 20 second video script

[01:39:13 - 01:39:16]
On effective time management strategy

[01:39:16 - 01:39:19]
It should be informational

[01:39:19 - 01:39:22]
I can make long content

[01:39:22 - 01:39:25]
It is good for me

[01:39:25 - 01:39:34]
Let's check

[01:39:34 - 01:39:37]
I am not happy with this

[01:39:37 - 01:39:40]
On a busy day

[01:39:40 - 01:39:45]
Cover top strategies

[01:39:45 - 01:39:54]
It is a short and good script

[01:39:54 - 01:39:57]
Now I have a problem

[01:39:57 - 01:40:00]
I am not happy with this

[01:40:00 - 01:40:04]
I'm not satisfied with this. I know what I want to say, but

[01:40:04 - 01:40:07]
if I'm using chat GPT, I could also try storyboarding.

[01:40:07 - 01:40:13]
So what do I say, write a screenplay for me, write a

[01:40:13 - 01:40:17]
screenplay for this script in Hindi.

[01:40:17 - 01:40:21]
So let's remove Hindi, let's do English only.

[01:40:21 - 01:40:24]
The opening shot sets the scene of a busy business

[01:40:24 - 01:40:28]
entrepreneur sitting at their desk, surrounded by piles of

[01:40:28 - 01:40:31]
papers and looking concerned. They seem worried about

[01:40:31 - 01:40:33]
something and it shows on their face.

[01:40:33 - 01:40:38]
So you can see how he's able to create a movie-like

[01:40:38 - 01:40:43]
experience, even if you don't have any background in film.

[01:40:43 - 01:40:48]
Personally, I find this prompting technique really helpful

[01:40:48 - 01:40:51]
for content creation.

[01:40:51 - 01:40:53]
Personally, I struggle with creating short content.

[01:40:53 - 01:40:57]
Whenever I attempt to create something short, it ends up

[01:40:57 - 01:41:00]
being 2-3 minutes long. However, I find that this method

[01:41:00 - 01:41:03]
helps me keep my content concise and I really enjoy it. The

[01:41:03 - 01:41:07]
best part is that I can create a content machine on my own.

[01:41:07 - 01:41:09]
I don't need anything else.

[01:41:09 - 01:41:12]
If I want, I can ask for a B-roll, if I ask how to do

[01:41:12 - 01:41:15]
editing, he is able to tell me that.

[01:41:15 - 01:41:18]
Everything is done by AI for me, and this is just a

[01:41:18 - 01:41:19]
beginning.

[01:41:19 - 01:41:22]
Currently, the topic of discussion is Prompt Engineering.

[01:41:22 - 01:41:26]
Tools are being developed gradually and Prompt Engineering

[01:41:26 - 01:41:29]
is introducing its own plug-in ecosystem, which will enable

[01:41:29 - 01:41:31]
it to collaborate with other tools.

[01:41:31 - 01:41:34]
Just imagine what is going to happen in the future.

[01:41:34 - 01:41:37]
The prompting that we are learning, with this prompting you

[01:41:37 - 01:41:41]
can build your own tool, and by building that tool you can

[01:41:41 - 01:41:42]
also make a business.

[01:41:42 - 01:41:45]
Right now I have told you about the prompt of short idea

[01:41:45 - 01:41:47]
generation, you can copy it as it is.

[01:41:47 - 01:41:50]
Now you know that you have to do this first, then this,

[01:41:50 - 01:41:51]
then this, then this.

[01:41:51 - 01:41:57]
Now you can make your own tool by using the API of chatGPT.

[01:41:57 - 01:42:01]
I know it may sound technical, but I'm sharing a business

[01:42:01 - 01:42:04]
idea with you. With this prompt tool, you can build a lot

[01:42:04 - 01:42:07]
of things and this is just the beginning.

[01:42:07 - 01:42:14]
The world is going to go ahead, in the coming few months.

[01:42:14 - 01:42:17]
So now let's talk about social media marketing.

[01:42:17 - 01:42:22]
How can you become an expert in social media marketing by

[01:42:22 - 01:42:23]
using chatGPT?

[01:42:23 - 01:42:27]
ChatGPT can help you in many things.

[01:42:27 - 01:42:31]
From content creation to content creation idea, its

[01:42:31 - 01:42:33]
designing and many more.

[01:42:33 - 01:42:36]
So first of all, let's talk about the most basic thing.

[01:42:36 - 01:42:39]
If we have to post something on social media, then the

[01:42:39 - 01:42:42]
description that we have to create is a kind of copywriting.

[01:42:42 - 01:42:46]
So in copywriting, chatGPT has always been very good.

[01:42:46 - 01:42:49]
So chatGPT can help you in copywriting.

[01:42:49 - 01:42:52]
So let's go and check how it is doing.

[01:42:52 - 01:42:56]
So first of all, we say, write an engaging social media

[01:42:56 - 01:42:57]
caption to use.

[01:42:57 - 01:43:01]
What am I going to do here? I have a soap of organic skin

[01:43:01 - 01:43:01]
care.

[01:43:01 - 01:43:03]
For that, I want to use some captions.

[01:43:03 - 01:43:05]
So let's see what it is doing.

[01:43:05 - 01:43:07]
You see, it is also giving us an emoji.

[01:43:07 - 01:43:11]
You should always include an emoji in your social media

[01:43:11 - 01:43:13]
content as it helps increase CTR.

[01:43:13 - 01:43:16]
I didn't go into technical, what is CTR, what is not.

[01:43:16 - 01:43:19]
But this increases your engagement.

[01:43:19 - 01:43:22]
If you want, you can also generate hashtags from chatGPT.

[01:43:22 - 01:43:25]
It helps you in creating popular hashtags.

[01:43:25 - 01:43:28]
But I will not recommend you to make a hashtag strategy

[01:43:28 - 01:43:29]
from here.

[01:43:29 - 01:43:32]
But if you want to use 2-3 popular hashtags, then it is

[01:43:32 - 01:43:33]
very good for that.

[01:43:33 - 01:43:39]
So here I wrote, generate 20 relevant popular Instagram

[01:43:39 - 01:43:42]
hashtags, hit enter.

[01:43:42 - 01:43:44]
So it has created a hashtag for me, which is both relevant

[01:43:44 - 01:43:45]
and popular.

[01:43:45 - 01:43:46]
We can use it.

[01:43:46 - 01:43:49]
If we are generating content, then there is a lot of

[01:43:49 - 01:43:50]
content in Twitter.

[01:43:50 - 01:43:52]
So can we create Twitter threads?

[01:43:52 - 01:43:56]
I mean, can we create serial orders of tweets?

[01:43:56 - 01:43:57]
Let's try.

[01:44:06 - 01:44:09]
So whatever you are seeing here, you can put any topic

[01:44:09 - 01:44:10]
instead of the importance.

[01:44:10 - 01:44:11]
I hit enter.

[01:44:11 - 01:44:18]
So I got a lot of options, what can we do.

[01:44:18 - 01:44:23]
So I pick a topic from it.

[01:44:23 - 01:44:25]
I like this one.

[01:44:25 - 01:44:28]
Write a Twitter thread on.

[01:44:28 - 01:44:29]
Hit enter.

[01:44:29 - 01:44:34]
So what does Twitter thread mean here?

[01:44:34 - 01:44:37]
The original translation is already correct and does not

[01:44:37 - 01:44:38]
require any changes.

[01:44:38 - 01:44:40]
So it is doing it for you.

[01:44:40 - 01:44:42]
Now you can also automate it.

[01:44:42 - 01:44:45]
So if you want to make a thread of tweets,

[01:44:45 - 01:44:48]
Nowadays we see a lot of people, they put tweets, they are

[01:44:48 - 01:44:50]
after a lot of educational tweets.

[01:44:50 - 01:44:51]
So you can create from here.

[01:44:51 - 01:44:55]
And the most interesting thing is that chatGPT content runs

[01:44:55 - 01:44:55]
in social media.

[01:44:55 - 01:44:56]
There is no problem.

[01:44:56 - 01:45:00]
Like Google penalizes you to use chatGPT content.

[01:45:00 - 01:45:03]
Here social media does not do anything like this.

[01:45:03 - 01:45:05]
So here it has made 10 threads for me.

[01:45:05 - 01:45:09]
Like it has made 10 threads, if I want I can also make its

[01:45:09 - 01:45:09]
Instagram post.

[01:45:09 - 01:45:12]
Now I am saying, help me create an Instagram carousel on

[01:45:12 - 01:45:12]
the above thread.

[01:45:12 - 01:45:18]
So here it is telling what to write in slide 1, what to do

[01:45:18 - 01:45:21]
in slide 2, what to do in slide 3.

[01:45:22 - 01:45:23]
End of story.

[01:45:23 - 01:45:26]
Instagram is helping us to make carousel.

[01:45:26 - 01:45:28]
Twitter is helping us to create post.

[01:45:28 - 01:45:30]
If we are putting a photo of our product, we have to write

[01:45:30 - 01:45:32]
some catchy things on it.

[01:45:32 - 01:45:33]
It is helping us for that.

[01:45:33 - 01:45:37]
If we want hashtags, it is helping us for hashtags.

[01:45:37 - 01:45:40]
When it comes to creating a video script, we've learned

[01:45:40 - 01:45:43]
that Prompt Engineering can assist us in that aspect of

[01:45:43 - 01:45:44]
video production.

[01:45:44 - 01:45:45]
Now is social media only this?

[01:45:45 - 01:45:47]
Posting, tweeting, posting videos.

[01:45:47 - 01:45:49]
There are also groups on Facebook.

[01:45:49 - 01:45:50]
There are also polls.

[01:45:50 - 01:45:52]
So let's talk about Facebook group first.

[01:45:52 - 01:45:55]
Here what I have said, create a list of 5 catchy relevant

[01:45:55 - 01:45:59]
titles for a Facebook group discussing make money online.

[01:45:59 - 01:46:01]
So it is taking catchy things for me.

[01:46:01 - 01:46:03]
Now I will put it directly in the group.

[01:46:03 - 01:46:06]
And people will comment below and will engage.

[01:46:06 - 01:46:09]
I can use the same thing in the community section of

[01:46:09 - 01:46:10]
YouTube.

[01:46:10 - 01:46:13]
I can use the same thing on Twitter if I want.

[01:46:13 - 01:46:19]
The profit powerhouse unleashing the potential of online

[01:46:19 - 01:46:20]
income stream.

[01:46:20 - 01:46:23]
Now how to create content around it, I am not going to

[01:46:23 - 01:46:23]
repeat it.

[01:46:23 - 01:46:25]
Because we have done it many times.

[01:46:25 - 01:46:27]
And according to me, if you are practicing along with me,

[01:46:27 - 01:46:29]
then you must have perfected this thing.

[01:46:29 - 01:46:32]
On any title, according to your theme, according to your

[01:46:32 - 01:46:34]
emotions, how to create content.

[01:46:34 - 01:46:37]
Now let's talk about the titles of YouTube videos.

[01:46:37 - 01:46:39]
Because I personally tell you that I have a lot of

[01:46:39 - 01:46:41]
difficulty in making the titles of YouTube videos.

[01:46:41 - 01:46:43]
Because I am an SEO guy.

[01:46:43 - 01:46:47]
And I always have SEO in my mind that keywords, keywords,

[01:46:47 - 01:46:48]
keywords keywords.

[01:46:48 - 01:46:52]
But I have recently realized that we should go above the

[01:46:52 - 01:46:53]
keywords in social media.

[01:46:53 - 01:46:56]
The more we have copywriting in social media, the strategy

[01:46:56 - 01:46:58]
we use in Facebook ads, Google ads.

[01:46:58 - 01:47:02]
We should do the same strategy in our YouTube videos.

[01:47:02 - 01:47:05]
So let's see how we can create YouTube titles.

[01:47:05 - 01:47:08]
So now I am getting a video on hiring and retention.

[01:47:08 - 01:47:10]
Again, it is a very niche topic, it is a very technical

[01:47:10 - 01:47:10]
video.

[01:47:10 - 01:47:12]
Many people may not want to see.

[01:47:12 - 01:47:16]
Create an attention-grabbing YouTube title for the video.

[01:47:16 - 01:47:18]
It should appeal mass.

[01:47:18 - 01:47:26]
Make it in Hindi.

[01:47:26 - 01:47:36]
Video is about hiring and how employees can avoid toxic

[01:47:36 - 01:47:37]
culture.

[01:47:37 - 01:47:39]
Give me some.

[01:47:41 - 01:47:44]
So what did I do? I stopped it and it was written in Hindi.

[01:47:44 - 01:47:45]
I went straight to write in English.

[01:47:45 - 01:47:46]
Yes, this will work.

[01:47:46 - 01:47:48]
The toxicity trap.

[01:47:48 - 01:47:50]
Iron secret for a healthy work environment.

[01:47:50 - 01:47:51]
This is very good.

[01:47:51 - 01:47:55]
If I talk and go, I am going to use this title.

[01:47:55 - 01:47:57]
Culture fit to culture misfit.

[01:47:57 - 01:47:58]
Breaking the cycle.

[01:47:58 - 01:47:59]
Toxicity myth.

[01:47:59 - 01:48:00]
Toxicity alert.

[01:48:00 - 01:48:01]
I like this.

[01:48:01 - 01:48:02]
The toxicity trap.

[01:48:02 - 01:48:03]
I like this.

[01:48:03 - 01:48:06]
So this is both catchy and useful which I can use.

[01:48:06 - 01:48:08]
So we have seen how to make a thumbnail.

[01:48:08 - 01:48:10]
We have seen how to make a script.

[01:48:10 - 01:48:11]
We have also written captions.

[01:48:11 - 01:48:13]
We have also used hashtags.

[01:48:13 - 01:48:14]
What else is left?

[01:48:14 - 01:48:15]
Engagement hacks.

[01:48:15 - 01:48:16]
Engagement hacks.

[01:48:16 - 01:48:19]
The easiest way is to ask questions to your audience.

[01:48:19 - 01:48:20]
Ask questions.

[01:48:20 - 01:48:21]
They will answer.

[01:48:21 - 01:48:22]
Engagement will increase.

[01:48:22 - 01:48:24]
We can ask questions in the story.

[01:48:24 - 01:48:26]
People will answer us from there.

[01:48:26 - 01:48:28]
This option comes in Instagram.

[01:48:28 - 01:48:31]
We can ask questions directly on Twitter.

[01:48:31 - 01:48:34]
If I talk about YouTube, I can ask questions directly in

[01:48:34 - 01:48:35]
the YouTube community.

[01:48:35 - 01:48:36]
So let's try it once.

[01:48:36 - 01:48:39]
Write 10 engaging Instagram story questions to ask

[01:48:39 - 01:48:43]
followers about local marketing strategy they found around

[01:48:43 - 01:48:43]
them.

[01:48:43 - 01:48:45]
I have written the spelling wrong.

[01:48:45 - 01:48:54]
I like this.

[01:48:54 - 01:48:58]
Have you witnessed any creative guerrilla marketing tactic

[01:48:58 - 01:48:59]
by local business in your area?

[01:48:59 - 01:49:00]
Tell us the story.

[01:49:00 - 01:49:02]
We can put this in the community.

[01:49:02 - 01:49:06]
And the most interesting thing is that I can create traffic

[01:49:06 - 01:49:06]
with engagement.

[01:49:06 - 01:49:09]
Because I have made a video on guerrilla marketing.

[01:49:09 - 01:49:11]
What I have to do is to write a question.

[01:49:11 - 01:49:14]
And write below that if you don't know about guerrilla

[01:49:14 - 01:49:15]
marketing, then this is the link of the video.

[01:49:15 - 01:49:16]
Go and watch it.

[01:49:16 - 01:49:18]
Now I can ask polls instead of questions.

[01:49:18 - 01:49:20]
Let's make a poll around guerrilla marketing.

[01:49:20 - 01:49:24]
Generate a list of 5 relevant, thought-provoking options

[01:49:24 - 01:49:27]
for a Twitter poll on a topic guerrilla marketing.

[01:49:27 - 01:49:33]
You can write Twitter poll, Instagram poll, etc.

[01:49:33 - 01:49:40]
So it is giving me ideas for the poll.

[01:49:40 - 01:49:44]
If we have written Twitter poll, it is giving 5 options.

[01:49:44 - 01:49:46]
If I want, I can put a prompt on it.

[01:49:46 - 01:49:48]
I will do progressive prompting.

[01:49:48 - 01:49:52]
I will say that I don't want 5 options, I want 4 options.

[01:49:52 - 01:49:55]
It will create 4 options for guerrilla marketing.

[01:49:55 - 01:49:57]
I don't do this on my channel.

[01:49:57 - 01:49:58]
But we do it for clients.

[01:49:58 - 01:50:02]
This is all about engaging with the audience. We create

[01:50:02 - 01:50:06]
polls and ask questions on a daily basis to keep them

[01:50:06 - 01:50:08]
interested in us.

[01:50:08 - 01:50:10]
Now what to do next?

[01:50:10 - 01:50:12]
I am doing a different thing for the thumbnail.

[01:50:12 - 01:50:15]
I have seen that if you make negative thumbnails, then

[01:50:15 - 01:50:17]
thumbnails work.

[01:50:17 - 01:50:20]
But the problem is that if you ask chatgpt to write

[01:50:20 - 01:50:23]
negative, then it will not make a negative thumbnail for

[01:50:23 - 01:50:24]
you.

[01:50:24 - 01:50:26]
So there is a different way of doing this.

[01:50:26 - 01:50:32]
Give me a YouTube thumbnail idea on gorilla marketing that

[01:50:32 - 01:50:37]
contradicts the dominant narrative.

[01:50:37 - 01:50:39]
This is the keyword that I have written.

[01:50:39 - 01:50:42]
Basically, this is my hack to find it.

[01:50:42 - 01:50:45]
Because I have tried it when I ask chatgpt to write

[01:50:45 - 01:50:47]
negative, then it doesn't work.

[01:50:47 - 01:50:48]
There is a way to do this.

[01:50:48 - 01:50:51]
If you want to make it negative, then you have to install a

[01:50:51 - 01:50:55]
model like chatgpt locally and work locally.

[01:50:55 - 01:50:57]
You have to install it in your computer.

[01:50:57 - 01:50:59]
Again, this is out of the scope of the course.

[01:50:59 - 01:51:03]
If you do a little deep research, you will understand.

[01:51:03 - 01:51:04]
For this, your graphic card of the system should be very

[01:51:04 - 01:51:05]
good.

[01:51:05 - 01:51:07]
So let's see what it is doing here.

[01:51:07 - 01:51:09]
Use a split screen effect on one side.

[01:51:09 - 01:51:13]
Show a typical image associated with traditional marketing.

[01:51:13 - 01:51:16]
On the other side, showcase a captivating gorilla marketing.

[01:51:16 - 01:51:20]
Write, break the mold in large, attention-grabbing letters.

[01:51:20 - 01:51:23]
Emphasize the contrast between gorilla marketing and

[01:51:23 - 01:51:24]
dominant EA.

[01:51:24 - 01:51:26]
First, divide it in half.

[01:51:26 - 01:51:28]
Then write big text.

[01:51:28 - 01:51:30]
Breaking the mold.

[01:51:30 - 01:51:33]
The photos you are going to use should have surprise faces.

[01:51:33 - 01:51:35]
There should be shocking faces.

[01:51:35 - 01:51:37]
Use vibrant colors in your thumbnail.

[01:51:37 - 01:51:40]
It has been seen that if thumbnails are a little vibrant

[01:51:40 - 01:51:43]
and colorful, then they are more attention-grabbing.

[01:51:43 - 01:51:47]
If you want, you can also use icons for this.

[01:51:47 - 01:51:49]
It generates an idea for me.

[01:51:49 - 01:51:52]
If I want, I can ask it to give me 5 more ideas.

[01:51:52 - 01:51:54]
Give me another idea.

[01:51:54 - 01:51:58]
I can do it by asking it to give me as many ideas as I want.

[01:51:58 - 01:52:05]
It gave me another idea.

[01:52:05 - 01:52:07]
This is a very good method.

[01:52:07 - 01:52:10]
You will get a mid-journey in the bonus material of the

[01:52:10 - 01:52:10]
course.

[01:52:10 - 01:52:14]
In the mid-journey, I will teach you how to generate images

[01:52:14 - 01:52:14]
from AI.

[01:52:14 - 01:52:16]
We are generating text so far.

[01:52:16 - 01:52:18]
We can also generate images.

[01:52:18 - 01:52:20]
We will learn that later.

[01:52:20 - 01:52:22]
We will generate content from this.

[01:52:22 - 01:52:25]
We will make thumbnail photos accordingly.

[01:52:25 - 01:52:27]
Let me tell you a very important thing.

[01:52:27 - 01:52:30]
A social media marketer gets a lot of money from this.

[01:52:30 - 01:52:32]
We call it creating a social media calendar.

[01:52:32 - 01:52:34]
What is a social media calendar?

[01:52:34 - 01:52:39]
This will come on 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th.

[01:52:39 - 01:52:41]
Let's see what we can do.

[01:52:41 - 01:52:46]
Create a 30-day social media calendar for our digital

[01:52:46 - 01:52:47]
marketing agency.

[01:52:47 - 01:52:50]
Let's enter.

[01:52:50 - 01:52:52]
What do we have to do on day 1?

[01:52:52 - 01:52:53]
We have to share the success story.

[01:52:53 - 01:52:54]
What do we have to do on day 2?

[01:52:54 - 01:52:55]
We have to do this.

[01:52:55 - 01:52:56]
What do we have to do on day 3?

[01:52:56 - 01:52:57]
We have to do this.

[01:52:57 - 01:52:58]
It is giving us a lot of ideas.

[01:52:58 - 01:53:00]
It is telling us to share the success story.

[01:53:00 - 01:53:04]
It is giving us a 30-day social media calendar.

[01:53:04 - 01:53:06]
We had to think a lot.

[01:53:06 - 01:53:08]
A few years ago,

[01:53:08 - 01:53:10]
Let me talk about an agency level.

[01:53:10 - 01:53:13]
We had to approve the social media calendar of the client.

[01:53:13 - 01:53:15]
We have to do this on Monday and that on Tuesday.

[01:53:15 - 01:53:17]
We had to think a lot.

[01:53:17 - 01:53:20]
It is very easy now.

[01:53:20 - 01:53:22]
We have to do one thing.

[01:53:22 - 01:53:25]
We have to do content mix.

[01:53:25 - 01:53:28]
It is telling us what we have to do.

[01:53:28 - 01:53:35]
We have to use video, photo, carousel, story, reel.

[01:53:35 - 01:53:37]
It is on us.

[01:53:37 - 01:53:38]
How will it be done?

[01:53:38 - 01:53:40]
It will be done by doing computer research.

[01:53:40 - 01:53:43]
It will be done by knowing what we have to do.

[01:53:43 - 01:53:46]
You can do it by chatting.

[01:53:46 - 01:53:49]
I will not recommend you to do it by chatting.

[01:53:49 - 01:53:52]
People's emotions can't be expressed by chatting.

[01:53:52 - 01:53:55]
If your competitor is using reel,

[01:53:55 - 01:53:58]
It means he is doing business with reel.

[01:53:58 - 01:54:00]
You can also use reel.

[01:54:00 - 01:54:04]
I hope you have understood social media.

[01:54:04 - 01:54:09]
You don't have to think how to do this on social media.

[01:54:09 - 01:54:11]
ChatGPT can do everything for you.

[01:54:11 - 01:54:18]
We are going to do something interesting in this video.

[01:54:18 - 01:54:21]
We are going to make chatGPT our advisor.

[01:54:21 - 01:54:25]
If we are running a business and we are facing a problem,

[01:54:25 - 01:54:28]
How can chatGPT help us?

[01:54:28 - 01:54:33]
If I am stuck in my career, How can chatGPT help me?

[01:54:33 - 01:54:37]
How can we make chatGPT our advisor?

[01:54:37 - 01:54:39]
And get outputs from it.

[01:54:39 - 01:54:42]
First, we start with single prompts.

[01:54:42 - 01:54:45]
We tell them to tell us about this.

[01:54:45 - 01:54:46]
I don't have knowledge.

[01:54:46 - 01:54:48]
I am running a business.

[01:54:48 - 01:54:51]
I have to find bundle pricing strategies.

[01:54:51 - 01:54:55]
How can I find bundle pricing strategies? Please tell me.

[01:54:55 - 01:54:59]
I don't know what is pricing strategy.

[01:54:59 - 01:55:03]
First, I ask them to tell me types of pricing strategies.

[01:55:03 - 01:55:04]
They will tell me.

[01:55:04 - 01:55:07]
I can check individually for my business.

[01:55:07 - 01:55:10]
I am asking them to tell me how to do it.

[01:55:11 - 01:55:13]
First, they are telling me that

[01:55:13 - 01:55:16]
We can do related courses together.

[01:55:16 - 01:55:19]
We can do bundle pricing above a certain level.

[01:55:19 - 01:55:23]
We can do promotional bundle for a limited time.

[01:55:23 - 01:55:26]
We can do many more things.

[01:55:26 - 01:55:28]
This is a one-step prompt.

[01:55:28 - 01:55:31]
I want to know the answer of any question.

[01:55:31 - 01:55:32]
I asked them the question.

[01:55:32 - 01:55:34]
They told me the answer.

[01:55:34 - 01:55:36]
I don't have to Google for it.

[01:55:36 - 01:55:38]
I don't have to do much research for it.

[01:55:38 - 01:55:40]
I have to ask the question.

[01:55:40 - 01:55:42]
Baby, business is my life.

[01:55:42 - 01:55:44]
It will tell me many things.

[01:55:44 - 01:55:46]
There are many things.

[01:55:46 - 01:55:48]
For example, you are in trouble.

[01:55:48 - 01:55:49]
Your girlfriend left you.

[01:55:49 - 01:55:51]
If you ask him, he will tell you.

[01:55:51 - 01:55:53]
I don't have a role.

[01:55:53 - 01:55:54]
I can't tell you about it.

[01:55:54 - 01:55:56]
But you can do this.

[01:55:56 - 01:55:58]
My...

[01:55:58 - 01:56:00]
Broke up with me.

[01:56:00 - 01:56:03]
How can I move on?

[01:56:03 - 01:56:05]
I am writing it randomly.

[01:56:05 - 01:56:06]
What does it do?

[01:56:06 - 01:56:09]
I am sorry to hear about your break up.

[01:56:09 - 01:56:11]
It is giving me support.

[01:56:11 - 01:56:14]
It is giving relationship advice.

[01:56:14 - 01:56:17]
I don't need a relationship advisor.

[01:56:17 - 01:56:19]
I don't need a friend.

[01:56:19 - 01:56:21]
I know that my friends will make fun of me.

[01:56:21 - 01:56:24]
But chat GPT can help me.

[01:56:24 - 01:56:26]
It is not only about business.

[01:56:26 - 01:56:29]
You can ask any question.

[01:56:29 - 01:56:31]
It can give you the answer.

[01:56:31 - 01:56:33]
But you have to be open.

[01:56:33 - 01:56:35]
It gives you the wrong answers.

[01:56:35 - 01:56:39]
Many people rely on it.

[01:56:39 - 01:56:43]
And they go into depression.

[01:56:43 - 01:56:47]
Don't use AI to govern your life.

[01:56:47 - 01:56:49]
Don't give it the key to your life.

[01:56:49 - 01:56:51]
You don't have the key.

[01:56:51 - 01:56:53]
It is giving you a guiding path.

[01:56:53 - 01:56:55]
You can do this.

[01:56:55 - 01:56:57]
It is my choice.

[01:56:57 - 01:56:59]
Don't trust blindly.

[01:56:59 - 01:57:00]
I am a marketer.

[01:57:00 - 01:57:02]
Let's see the marketing problem.

[01:57:02 - 01:57:04]
I am addressing the advanced level problem.

[01:57:04 - 01:57:07]
Let's see if it can do it.

[01:57:07 - 01:57:10]
Create a list of 10 tactics for increasing average order

[01:57:10 - 01:57:13]
value for a website selling organic soap.

[01:57:13 - 01:57:14]
Let's see what it does.

[01:57:14 - 01:57:16]
You can cross sell.

[01:57:16 - 01:57:18]
It is the right answer.

[01:57:18 - 01:57:19]
You can upsell.

[01:57:19 - 01:57:20]
It is the right answer.

[01:57:20 - 01:57:22]
You can make bundle deals.

[01:57:22 - 01:57:24]
It is the right answer.

[01:57:24 - 01:57:26]
You can give free shipping on a threshold.

[01:57:26 - 01:57:28]
You can order for Rs.1000.

[01:57:28 - 01:57:29]
You won't have to pay shipping charges.

[01:57:29 - 01:57:30]
It is the right answer.

[01:57:30 - 01:57:32]
You can make limited time offers.

[01:57:32 - 01:57:33]
You can make loyalty programs.

[01:57:33 - 01:57:35]
You can give personal recommendations.

[01:57:35 - 01:57:37]
You can give volume discounts.

[01:57:37 - 01:57:40]
You can buy gifts.

[01:57:40 - 01:57:42]
You can make product add-ons.

[01:57:42 - 01:57:44]
I didn't think of product add-ons.

[01:57:44 - 01:57:46]
But it can be done.

[01:57:46 - 01:57:47]
It is the right answer.

[01:57:47 - 01:57:52]
It is giving me the right answer.

[01:57:52 - 01:57:53]
I am asking for 10.

[01:57:53 - 01:57:55]
I can ask for 20, 30, 50 ideas.

[01:57:55 - 01:57:56]
It is my choice.

[01:57:56 - 01:57:58]
I can select as many as I want.

[01:57:58 - 01:58:00]
Let's try audience segmentation.

[01:58:00 - 01:58:04]
You need to know about marketing.

[01:58:04 - 01:58:08]
If you don't know about marketing, chatgpt can help you.

[01:58:08 - 01:58:09]
Let's check.

[01:58:09 - 01:58:11]
Create a list of 10 strategies for segmenting customers

[01:58:11 - 01:58:13]
based on their interest.

[01:58:13 - 01:58:16]
Eco-friendly, sustainable product.

[01:58:16 - 01:58:17]
I am selling soap.

[01:58:17 - 01:58:19]
It is eco-friendly and sustainable.

[01:58:19 - 01:58:20]
Let's check the regarding.

[01:58:20 - 01:58:24]
Nice.

[01:58:24 - 01:58:26]
I didn't think of it.

[01:58:26 - 01:58:35]
If I talk about myself, I consider myself a good marketer.

[01:58:35 - 01:58:37]
I could have found 4-5 options.

[01:58:37 - 01:58:40]
It gave me 10 options in a few seconds.

[01:58:40 - 01:58:42]
Again, I am asking for 10.

[01:58:42 - 01:58:43]
I can ask for 50.

[01:58:43 - 01:58:46]
I can shortlist it.

[01:58:46 - 01:58:48]
Let's do one more business problem.

[01:58:48 - 01:58:50]
My soap business is not doing well.

[01:58:50 - 01:58:52]
I am not able to retain customers.

[01:58:52 - 01:58:54]
How can I retain customers?

[01:58:54 - 01:58:59]
Generate a list of 10 strategies for retaining customers

[01:58:59 - 01:59:00]
interested in this.

[01:59:00 - 01:59:02]
You can do personalized communication.

[01:59:03 - 01:59:06]
You can provide educational content.

[01:59:06 - 01:59:07]
You can engage in social media.

[01:59:07 - 01:59:08]
It is good.

[01:59:08 - 01:59:11]
I am getting good business advices.

[01:59:11 - 01:59:13]
I know about marketing.

[01:59:13 - 01:59:16]
I can tell you that it is giving the right answer.

[01:59:16 - 01:59:20]
If you don't have it, it is giving the right answer. It is

[01:59:20 - 01:59:24]
giving good ideas which you can use to grow your business.

[01:59:24 - 01:59:26]
You have a business consultant.

[01:59:26 - 01:59:28]
You have a business advisor.

[01:59:28 - 01:59:30]
You can ask for career advices.

[01:59:30 - 01:59:32]
You can ask for career advices.

[01:59:32 - 01:59:36]
If you have done 12th pass, and you are interested in these

[01:59:36 - 01:59:38]
things, you can tell me what you can do.

[01:59:38 - 01:59:39]
You can write 12th pass.

[01:59:39 - 01:59:40]
You can write high school.

[01:59:40 - 01:59:44]
If you have cleared high school, and you are interested in

[01:59:44 - 01:59:47]
this, and you want to do something, you can tell me what

[01:59:47 - 01:59:47]
you can do.

[01:59:47 - 01:59:50]
Why did I write high school? 12th pass is available in

[01:59:50 - 01:59:50]
India.

[01:59:50 - 01:59:54]
But if we talk about overall, globally, chatgpt is globally

[01:59:54 - 01:59:54]
trained.

[01:59:54 - 01:59:57]
So, using high school word is a good option.

[01:59:57 - 01:59:59]
Let's go for more technical.

[02:00:00 - 02:00:02]
We have to put a chatbot on our website

[02:00:02 - 02:00:05]
And to put a chatbot, I am not able to understand what

[02:00:05 - 02:00:06]
should be the flow of it

[02:00:06 - 02:00:09]
Write a script for a chatbot conversation assisting

[02:00:09 - 02:00:12]
customers with placing an order on the website

[02:00:12 - 02:00:14]
I will put the link of the website ahead, I will open my

[02:00:14 - 02:00:14]
website

[02:00:14 - 02:00:30]
I will copy it, put the link of the website and hit enter

[02:00:30 - 02:00:34]
So what I have done now is, I have been very lazy

[02:00:34 - 02:00:36]
I have directly told him that what should we do with the

[02:00:36 - 02:00:37]
link of this website

[02:00:37 - 02:00:40]
If I wanted, it could have been a little descriptive here

[02:00:40 - 02:00:43]
I could have told about my business, my business is about

[02:00:43 - 02:00:46]
this My products are this, my service is this, my audience

[02:00:46 - 02:00:46]
is this

[02:00:46 - 02:00:49]
Now tell me what should be the script of the chat flow

[02:00:49 - 02:00:51]
So he can also make it

[02:00:51 - 02:00:54]
Now chat flow is made, can he also make a sales script?

[02:00:54 - 02:00:56]
So I am a digital marketing agency owner

[02:00:56 - 02:01:02]
Let's create a sales script and figure out how to make it.

[02:01:02 - 02:01:08]
Can you assist me in developing a sales pitch flow chart

[02:01:08 - 02:01:14]
for my digital marketing agency's sales team when calling

[02:01:14 - 02:01:20]
business owners? Essentially, he has already outlined all

[02:01:20 - 02:01:23]
the necessary steps for me.

[02:01:23 - 02:01:27]
First things first, you need to qualify and engage with

[02:01:27 - 02:01:30]
respect. To qualify, pay attention to the important details.

[02:01:30 - 02:01:31]
What all things you have to pay attention to

[02:01:31 - 02:01:33]
So now I have made a flow chart

[02:01:33 - 02:01:37]
If I tell him to make a sales pitch for me, then what will

[02:01:37 - 02:01:37]
he make?

[02:01:37 - 02:01:39]
We create a sales pitch

[02:01:39 - 02:01:40]
So he has made both the things for me

[02:01:40 - 02:01:44]
If I were to hire a sales expert to create this flow, it

[02:01:44 - 02:01:48]
would cost me a minimum of $300-$400. But it's worth it

[02:01:48 - 02:01:50]
because it's in high demand in the market.

[02:01:50 - 02:01:52]
So here he is making AI

[02:01:53 - 02:01:56]
Yes, it is not full proof, you cannot rely on it 100%

[02:01:56 - 02:01:59]
But it is definitely giving you a base template

[02:01:59 - 02:02:02]
On which you can build yourself

[02:02:02 - 02:02:04]
So now I have to go to get funding

[02:02:04 - 02:02:06]
If I have to go to get funding, then an investor said, what

[02:02:06 - 02:02:07]
is your business plan?

[02:02:07 - 02:02:09]
Let's make our business plan

[02:02:09 - 02:02:11]
Write a comprehensive business plan for digital marketing

[02:02:11 - 02:02:12]
agency

[02:02:12 - 02:02:14]
You have to include this

[02:02:14 - 02:02:15]
If you hit enter, then it is telling what all things you

[02:02:15 - 02:02:16]
have to do

[02:02:16 - 02:02:18]
So basically, what I have written

[02:02:18 - 02:02:22]
That I want target market, financial projection, etc

[02:02:22 - 02:02:24]
So this is my understanding

[02:02:24 - 02:02:26]
If you don't know, then you can also ask

[02:02:26 - 02:02:29]
When I make a plan, what all things should be there in it?

[02:02:29 - 02:02:31]
So it will tell you that there should be 6 things

[02:02:31 - 02:02:33]
So in including, you have to put those 6 things in a comma

[02:02:33 - 02:02:36]
So now it is giving me an outline of how I have to go ahead

[02:02:36 - 02:02:39]
If I want, again I can use chat gpt to make it more

[02:02:39 - 02:02:40]
descriptive

[02:02:40 - 02:02:44]
And if I want, I can leave it here

[02:02:44 - 02:02:48]
I can explain everything manually in the presentation

[02:02:48 - 02:02:54]
This is my choice

[02:02:54 - 02:02:56]
Now I am going to kick my stomach

[02:02:56 - 02:02:58]
I am a marketer, I run a marketing agency

[02:02:58 - 02:03:00]
Now let's discuss the whole marketing plan

[02:03:00 - 02:03:04]
So create a marketing plan for our new digital marketing

[02:03:04 - 02:03:04]
course launch

[02:03:04 - 02:03:06]
Include detail on this and that

[02:03:06 - 02:03:08]
Hit enter

[02:03:08 - 02:03:10]
So I would like to tell you an inside story

[02:03:10 - 02:03:12]
In today's time, we make a lot of business proposals

[02:03:12 - 02:03:14]
We use chat gpt in it

[02:03:14 - 02:03:16]
And using these prompts

[02:03:17 - 02:03:19]
We make a lot of business proposals

[02:03:19 - 02:03:23]
So see here

[02:03:23 - 02:03:25]
What all is being told

[02:03:25 - 02:03:29]
What can we do in social media What can we do in email

[02:03:29 - 02:03:31]
marketing What can we do in dash

[02:03:31 - 02:03:33]
It is telling everything in detail

[02:03:33 - 02:03:37]
If you're not familiar with it, this is a great resource.

[02:03:37 - 02:03:41]
Plus, we've gained a lot of knowledge from using chat GPT.

[02:03:41 - 02:03:43]
Now we have learned how to make it work

[02:03:43 - 02:03:45]
I hope if you are following the course from the start

[02:03:45 - 02:03:47]
Then you must have understood

[02:03:47 - 02:03:51]
How can I make my work work Here it has given me input

[02:03:51 - 02:03:53]
Now I can make it work

[02:03:53 - 02:03:59]
So I have modified the sales person

[02:04:00 - 02:04:02]
To make you understand

[02:04:02 - 02:04:04]
See we say calling person

[02:04:04 - 02:04:06]
But actually it is called sales representative

[02:04:06 - 02:04:08]
So I have modified it a little

[02:04:08 - 02:04:11]
Write a script for a sales representative To use when cold

[02:04:11 - 02:04:12]
calling

[02:04:12 - 02:04:14]
Or presenting

[02:04:14 - 02:04:16]
To potential clients

[02:04:16 - 02:04:18]
Script should include information on company product

[02:04:18 - 02:04:20]
Service and how they benefit the customer

[02:04:20 - 02:04:22]
And I have told

[02:04:22 - 02:04:24]
What is our company

[02:04:24 - 02:04:26]
Our company is a digital marketing company

[02:04:26 - 02:04:30]
And our name is Lapaas

[02:04:30 - 02:04:32]
Hello, my name is Dash

[02:04:32 - 02:04:33]
I am calling for Lapaas, leading digital marketing company

[02:04:34 - 02:04:36]
How are you today?

[02:04:36 - 02:04:37]
I noticed that your business mentioned

[02:04:38 - 02:04:40]
You have made it good

[02:04:40 - 02:04:42]
I am satisfied with it

[02:04:42 - 02:04:44]
You will have to work a little

[02:04:44 - 02:04:46]
But it is working

[02:04:46 - 02:04:48]
If we talk about objections

[02:04:48 - 02:04:50]
It has also told about objections

[02:04:50 - 02:04:52]
Objections means

[02:04:52 - 02:04:54]
I have a problem

[02:04:54 - 02:04:56]
I will not do this

[02:04:56 - 02:04:58]
It has also given an answer

[02:04:58 - 02:05:00]
You may have some questions or concerns

[02:05:00 - 02:05:02]
Could you please share the specific concerns

[02:05:02 - 02:05:04]
Now he is saying

[02:05:04 - 02:05:06]
I don't want digital marketing service

[02:05:06 - 02:05:08]
I know you have some problems

[02:05:08 - 02:05:10]
Could you please explain

[02:05:10 - 02:05:12]
Why are you saying this?

[02:05:12 - 02:05:14]
What problems are you facing?

[02:05:14 - 02:05:18]
Wow, it is a very good script The prompting I am showing you

[02:05:18 - 02:05:22]
You can follow it as it is It is proven and tested

[02:05:22 - 02:05:24]
You can use it

[02:05:24 - 02:05:26]
You can build your own prompts around it

[02:05:26 - 02:05:28]
Here I have shown you

[02:05:28 - 02:05:30]
The prompts I am using on a personal level

[02:05:30 - 02:05:32]
And our company is using

[02:05:32 - 02:05:34]
You can also make pitch deck

[02:05:34 - 02:05:36]
We have not made pitch deck yet

[02:05:36 - 02:05:38]
My plan was to make pitch deck

[02:05:38 - 02:05:40]
But no client has come yet

[02:05:40 - 02:05:42]
Let me show you how to make pitch deck

[02:05:42 - 02:05:44]
Write a pitch deck for potential investors

[02:05:44 - 02:05:46]
The pitch deck should include

[02:05:46 - 02:05:48]
These projections

[02:05:48 - 02:05:50]
Now we will put our company name

[02:05:50 - 02:05:52]
We are a digital marketing company

[02:05:52 - 02:05:54]
Our name is Lapaas

[02:05:54 - 02:05:56]
Our current turnover is

[02:05:56 - 02:05:58]
INR 15 crores

[02:05:58 - 02:06:05]
We are growing 20% We are growing 20% annually

[02:06:05 - 02:06:07]
So basically

[02:06:07 - 02:06:09]
I wrote a prompt

[02:06:09 - 02:06:11]
And then I told you my business context

[02:06:11 - 02:06:21]
It is telling me what to do

[02:06:21 - 02:06:23]
And also giving me an example

[02:06:23 - 02:06:25]
What can I do in this

[02:06:25 - 02:06:27]
I am not saying you should copy and paste

[02:06:27 - 02:06:29]
You can take an idea

[02:06:29 - 02:06:31]
From here

[02:06:31 - 02:06:33]
So all the best

[02:06:33 - 02:06:35]
I think you have understood

[02:06:35 - 02:06:37]
I take Rs 20,000 for consultation

[02:06:37 - 02:06:39]

[02:08:46 - 02:08:54]
You can see Threads You can see My thing

[02:08:54 - 02:08:56]
If I go up

[02:08:56 - 02:09:00]
Superman in india Eating pizza near red fort

[02:09:00 - 02:09:08]
It is making 62% Let's open it It will go down

[02:09:09 - 02:09:14]
Superman For example

[02:09:14 - 02:09:24]
I like this 1,2,3,4 1,2,3,4 It is 3 If I go to 3

[02:09:24 - 02:09:28]
U3 U3 means

[02:09:28 - 02:09:34]
Upscale It will increase I clicked on upscale

V3 If I click on v3

[02:09:45 - 02:09:47]

[02:09:49 - 02:09:53]
Remix I have remixed it

[02:09:53 - 02:09:55]
I have to write slash

[02:09:55 - 02:09:58]
Click on settings

[02:09:58 - 02:10:03]
You will get settings Here you can see Remix

[02:10:03 - 02:10:04]
I have turned on Remix

[02:10:04 - 02:10:07]
If you want you can turn it off

[02:10:07 - 02:10:10]
If I do it in reset setting, it will be default

[02:10:10 - 02:10:13]
At the moment Mid Journey is running on 5.1

[02:10:13 - 02:10:16]
If I want to use the old one, I can use the old one

[02:10:16 - 02:10:18]
I will tell you the best option for this so that it doesn't

[02:10:18 - 02:10:19]
remain a cluttery thing

[02:10:19 - 02:10:22]
Because there is a lot of distraction here

[02:10:22 - 02:10:25]
Ideally if I have taken this version

[02:10:25 - 02:10:28]
I want to take advantage of the paid version

[02:10:29 - 02:10:31]
Here Mid Journey is running

[02:10:31 - 02:10:34]
I can do anything here

[02:10:34 - 02:10:37]
Whatever I do here, I can see it

[02:10:37 - 02:10:40]
Slash Settings Enter

[02:10:40 - 02:10:43]
So I got the settings

[02:10:43 - 02:10:46]
I just have to type Slash and it will come automatically

[02:10:46 - 02:10:49]
So you have only 4 options

[02:10:49 - 02:10:52]
Imagine, we have to type something

[02:10:52 - 02:10:55]
I will click on settings and it will open

[02:10:56 - 02:10:59]
Now we will explore the settings

[02:10:59 - 02:11:09]
Describe I have to upload an image

[02:11:09 - 02:11:16]
I have uploaded my photo and clicked on enter

[02:11:16 - 02:11:19]
It is telling me

[02:11:19 - 02:11:22]
I will go down and click on 1

[02:11:22 - 02:11:25]
It will show me this prompt

[02:11:25 - 02:11:28]
Imagine this one

[02:11:28 - 02:11:36]
You can see the output

[02:11:37 - 02:11:40]
Normally if we use it with images, it works very well

[02:11:40 - 02:11:43]
I am just showing you the features

[02:11:43 - 02:11:46]
Now we will use it properly

[02:11:46 - 02:11:50]
Next option is Blend

[02:11:50 - 02:11:53]
Let's delete this

[02:11:53 - 02:11:58]
Imagine close up of a superman in a dark sky

[02:11:58 - 02:12:03]

[02:12:03 - 02:12:06]
Hit enter

[02:12:07 - 02:12:32]
It is trying to understand my photo Let's take a ghost image

[02:12:32 - 02:12:35]
I like this one

[02:12:35 - 02:12:41]
Upscale U means upscale, V means variation

[02:12:41 - 02:12:44]
Upscale is done

[02:12:44 - 02:12:47]
I will click on it

[02:12:47 - 02:12:50]
Right click, save

[02:12:50 - 02:12:53]
I will type slash

[02:12:54 - 02:12:57]
Blend click

[02:12:57 - 02:13:01]
Image blend

[02:13:01 - 02:13:04]
Now hit enter

[02:13:04 - 02:13:07]
You can blend 4 images

[02:13:07 - 02:13:10]
I have only 2

[02:13:10 - 02:13:16]
It will try to merge these 2 photos Sometimes we are making

[02:13:16 - 02:13:16]
a design

[02:13:16 - 02:13:19]
And we feel it would have been better if it was this type

[02:13:19 - 02:13:22]
We take that image from google

[02:13:23 - 02:13:26]
Let's merge it

[02:13:26 - 02:13:31]
You will understand what i am saying It is trying to

[02:13:31 - 02:13:35]
understand my photo Using dark environment

[02:13:35 - 02:13:39]
It's trying to analyze my photo. If you think it doesn't

[02:13:39 - 02:13:44]
resemble me, I'll show you how to create a face like mine.

[02:13:44 - 02:13:58]
I will try to make a face like me Superman and Sahil Khanna

[02:13:58 - 02:14:01]
Now hit slash

[02:14:01 - 02:14:04]
We have one option, describe

[02:14:04 - 02:14:07]
One is blend, one is setting

[02:14:07 - 02:14:10]
And one is imagine

[02:14:10 - 02:14:13]
These are the 4 options

[02:14:13 - 02:14:16]
I have told you the basic idea of these 4 options

[02:14:16 - 02:14:19]
I want to show you the prompting

[02:14:19 - 02:14:22]
How to get the results from mid journey

[02:14:22 - 02:14:25]
As you want

[02:14:26 - 02:14:29]
It has a lot of options and parameters

[02:14:29 - 02:14:32]
I won't go in all parameters, you can go in documentation

[02:14:32 - 02:14:35]
You will get a lot

[02:14:35 - 02:14:38]
My logic is, you can make whatever you want

[02:14:38 - 02:14:41]
Let's start with imagine

[02:14:41 - 02:14:44]
We will write a basic thing

[02:14:44 - 02:14:47]
Hit slash

[02:14:47 - 02:14:55]
Change setting You can see options

[02:14:55 - 02:14:58]
Slash imagine

[02:14:58 - 02:15:01]
Man on a boat

[02:15:01 - 02:15:04]
I have written the same thing

[02:15:04 - 02:15:07]
I have made the stylized high

[02:15:07 - 02:15:10]
I have left the default medium

[02:15:10 - 02:15:13]
I have got good results on medium

[02:15:13 - 02:15:16]
As i want

[02:15:16 - 02:15:19]
I think it happens sometimes

[02:15:19 - 02:15:22]
Remix is always on

[02:15:23 - 02:15:26]
You can use it in raw

[02:15:26 - 02:15:29]
But not in many things

[02:15:29 - 02:15:32]
This is the lowest version

[02:15:32 - 02:15:35]
If you want to make animated things

[02:15:35 - 02:15:38]
You can use niji

[02:15:38 - 02:15:41]
Slash settings

[02:15:41 - 02:15:44]
Till then it is working

[02:15:44 - 02:15:47]
Let's do niji 5

[02:15:47 - 02:15:50]
Slash imagine

[02:15:52 - 02:15:55]
Man on a boat

[02:15:55 - 02:15:58]
Let me show you

[02:15:58 - 02:16:01]
I have made the first prompt

[02:16:01 - 02:16:04]
It is realistic

[02:16:04 - 02:16:13]
Let's upscale It looks human

[02:16:13 - 02:16:16]
We have increased the stylized

[02:16:16 - 02:16:19]
It is animated

[02:16:19 - 02:16:22]
Cartoonish

[02:16:22 - 02:16:28]
Artistic If you like artistic things

[02:16:28 - 02:16:31]
You can use it

[02:16:31 - 02:16:34]
Let's see niji

[02:16:34 - 02:16:37]
Niji is cartoonish

[02:16:37 - 02:16:40]
You have to see the style

[02:16:40 - 02:16:46]
Overall I like realistic things

[02:16:46 - 02:16:49]
I can use niji in many things

[02:16:50 - 02:16:56]
I will try to use stylized medium And mid journey 5

[02:16:56 - 02:17:02]
As i am going to mid journey 5 These options are coming

[02:17:02 - 02:17:05]
These are different ways

[02:17:05 - 02:17:12]
Let's understand describe

[02:17:12 - 02:17:15]
Let's go to google

[02:17:15 - 02:17:21]
Search On a boat

[02:17:24 - 02:17:27]
I want man on a boat

[02:17:27 - 02:17:34]
I don't know what kind of man on a boat I want something

[02:17:34 - 02:17:35]
like this

[02:18:27 - 02:18:30]

[02:18:36 - 02:18:48]
Stylize S750 Default If i want to increase stylize

[02:19:40 - 02:19:43]
So that you can use it

[02:19:43 - 02:19:46]
I can say

[02:19:46 - 02:19:49]
This is close

[02:19:49 - 02:19:52]
We have to select one

[02:19:52 - 02:19:55]
For example

[02:19:56 - 02:20:05]
I want to improve this 4 Let's see

[02:20:05 - 02:20:08]

[02:20:14 - 02:20:17]
Let's see

[02:20:17 - 02:20:20]
Let's try to upscale it and add some variation. Here, I'll

[02:20:20 - 02:20:23]
take a close-up shot and compare it to our original photo.

[02:20:23 - 02:20:26]
In our photo, the whole body is visible, but in this one,

[02:20:26 - 02:20:28]
it's not. So, I want to adjust it a bit.

[02:20:28 - 02:20:30]
Let's take a close-up shot and see how it turns out. I'll

[02:20:30 - 02:20:33]
explain how it will look and we can try to upscale it. In

[02:20:33 - 02:20:35]
our current photo, the whole body is visible, but in this

[02:20:35 - 02:20:37]
one, it's not. So, I want to adjust it a bit.

[02:20:39 - 02:20:41]
So, I've been hearing a lot about Prompt Engineering

[02:20:41 - 02:20:44]
lately. In the last month... I noticed that in our previous

[02:20:44 - 02:20:46]
photo, the whole body was visible, but in this one it's

[02:20:46 - 02:20:49]
not. I want to take a closer shot and see what happens.

[02:20:49 - 02:20:52]
I'll explain to you how it will look and we'll see what it

[02:20:52 - 02:20:54]
looks like. Let's talk about this close-up.

[02:20:54 - 02:20:57]
will always be the same, the style will be the same see,

[02:20:57 - 02:21:01]
the same photo has come, just a little bit of a different

[02:21:01 - 02:21:01]
style

[02:21:02 - 02:21:09]
let's let the one on top be made, what is going on, till

[02:21:09 - 02:21:16]
now it is 55% 83%, so basically it has done like this it

[02:21:16 - 02:21:19]
has not brought much change

[02:21:20 - 02:21:24]
and if I talk about the variation one, I am liking it the

[02:21:24 - 02:21:28]
way it has been made, so my logic was that you have to get

[02:21:28 - 02:21:31]
an idea from describe, how to use describe so that you can

[02:21:31 - 02:21:35]
take it to a very advanced level in the future for example

[02:21:35 - 02:21:42]
I went to unsplash which is a free site for images here I

[02:21:42 - 02:21:48]
will go, here I will write film for any experiment

[02:21:49 - 02:21:57]
and from this I will pick a style here let's do office this

[02:21:57 - 02:22:05]
office is looking good let's download it, now what we do

[02:22:05 - 02:22:09]
let's pick a photo from this

[02:22:10 - 02:22:16]
A1, let's take it up a notch by upscaling 1. We can either

[02:22:16 - 02:22:23]
describe the image or skip it and move on to the next level.

[02:22:24 - 02:22:30]
Let's blend it and save the image. You can see that it's of

[02:22:30 - 02:22:35]
high quality. If I say we did a photoshoot, no one can deny

[02:22:35 - 02:22:41]
it. Earlier, we faced some problems with our fingers during

[02:22:41 - 02:22:46]
the journey, but now that problem is resolved. Let's hit it.

[02:22:46 - 02:22:51]
So now, when you click on "blend", it will combine these

[02:22:51 - 02:22:56]
two images. Let's see how it turns out. Oh, it's a beach

[02:22:56 - 02:23:02]
photo. If it wasn't a beach photo, what would have happened?

[02:23:02 - 02:23:08]
Based on the context provided, it seems that the current

[02:23:08 - 02:23:13]
translation is already accurate and contextual. No changes

[02:23:13 - 02:23:14]
are needed.

[02:23:14 - 02:23:18]
I'll create a separate video on blending options. My aim is

[02:23:18 - 02:23:21]
to help you understand Prompt Engineering, not just the

[02:23:21 - 02:23:24]
tools. If you search online, you'll find many videos that

[02:23:24 - 02:23:27]
explain how blending works and how to use it effectively.

[02:23:27 - 02:23:29]
Let me know if you need more details on this.

[02:23:30 - 02:23:41]
very good, it is looking good this coat guy has been made

[02:23:41 - 02:23:48]
to stand in the office see, not bad

[02:23:48 - 02:23:52]
I was seeing this type of office, let's see it our original

[02:23:52 - 02:23:57]
image there is some furniture like this, there are some

[02:23:57 - 02:24:01]
walls like this there is some furniture like this, there

[02:24:01 - 02:24:05]
are some walls like this and this guy has been made to

[02:24:05 - 02:24:07]
stand there, let me upscale

[02:24:07 - 02:24:11]
it upscale 3, see what kind of image you have

[02:24:12 - 02:24:16]
Now let's get to the point - Prompt Engineering. I've been

[02:24:16 - 02:24:20]
hearing a lot about it lately. While we're discussing how

[02:24:20 - 02:24:23]
to describe things, you may have noticed that many people

[02:24:23 - 02:24:27]
are creating elaborate prompts. If we take a look at some

[02:24:27 - 02:24:31]
examples during our journey, we can learn from them.

[02:24:31 - 02:24:36]
sweet, potato, butter this is a simple prompt, but if you

[02:24:36 - 02:24:39]
see how someone has written, this big

[02:24:40 - 02:24:43]
Based on the context, it seems like the speaker is

[02:24:43 - 02:24:46]
discussing how to write effective prompts. Therefore, a

[02:24:46 - 02:24:50]
more appropriate translation could be:
"This is how it

[02:24:50 - 02:24:53]
works. To create an effective prompt, first write down your

[02:24:53 - 02:24:57]
idea. Then, include the keywords that convey your idea and

[02:24:57 - 02:24:58]
what you want."

[02:24:58 - 02:25:03]
in it, what do you want, so you have to put comma and put

[02:25:03 - 02:25:07]
some keywords now I will show you practically

[02:25:07 - 02:25:12]
After that, you need to specify which camera and lens you

[02:25:12 - 02:25:17]
want to use. You can search online for various camera

[02:25:17 - 02:25:22]
models and lenses. Let me explain about lenses - there are

[02:25:22 - 02:25:26]
three types: wide angle, zoom, and normal.

[02:25:26 - 02:25:30]
lens wide angle lens is if mm is less, if I say 12mm lens

[02:25:30 - 02:25:34]
then it will be very wide, what does wide mean?

[02:25:35 - 02:25:39]
if it is very far, then it will show my whole face if I

[02:25:39 - 02:25:44]
talk about zoom lens it is also called telephoto lens, it

[02:25:44 - 02:25:49]
is of 200mm so if it is very far then it may not show my

[02:25:49 - 02:25:54]
face properly like if I talk about now, it is almost 3 feet

[02:25:54 - 02:25:55]
far and you can see

[02:25:55 - 02:26:01]
this frame so this is a real life situation so you can see

[02:26:01 - 02:26:02]
how it varies

[02:26:03 - 02:26:08]
now we can add aperture f1.8, f2.7 f1.8 means the number

[02:26:08 - 02:26:13]
will be less, f1.8, f1.1 more blur will be there like if we

[02:26:13 - 02:26:19]
talk about this video, it is shooting at f1.8 if I shoot it

[02:26:19 - 02:26:24]
at f5, then more blur will be there again, I am not going

[02:26:24 - 02:26:26]
technical no need

[02:26:26 - 02:26:30]
to worry, if you are not understanding

[02:26:30 - 02:26:36]
You can copy and paste it, but if you understand the

[02:26:36 - 02:26:42]
technicalities, you can fine-tune it. Level 2 involves

[02:26:42 - 02:26:49]
understanding camera angles. Let me demonstrate how I will

[02:26:49 - 02:26:55]
use a prompt to change the camera angle. First, we have the

[02:26:55 - 02:26:57]
eye-level shot.

[02:26:58 - 02:27:04]
this camera is going from down to up camera is in the eye

[02:27:04 - 02:27:10]
level camera is going from up to down extreme low angle

[02:27:10 - 02:27:16]
shot extreme high angle shot side angle so basically what

[02:27:16 - 02:27:23]
is happening what we are defining because of this, our body

[02:27:23 - 02:27:25]
posture is changing

[02:27:26 - 02:27:31]
So, I've been hearing a lot about Prompt Engineering

[02:27:31 - 02:27:35]
lately. In the upcoming month, we'll be discussing

[02:27:35 - 02:27:41]
different camera angles such as eye level shot, extreme low

[02:27:41 - 02:27:46]
angle shot, extreme high angle shot, and side angle. These

[02:27:46 - 02:27:52]
angles affect our body posture and how we are perceived on

[02:27:52 - 02:27:53]
camera.

[02:27:53 - 02:27:58]
you can consider this in close up shot but this is not

[02:27:58 - 02:28:03]
close up shot logically, this is not full shot full shot is

[02:28:03 - 02:28:07]
visible this is the reason why you need to understand if

[02:28:07 - 02:28:12]
you understand, you will know if it is going right or not I

[02:28:12 - 02:28:15]
am telling you technical

[02:28:15 - 02:28:20]
words when you are prompting, you are getting the result

[02:28:21 - 02:28:28]
extreme close up shot face is visible same prompt is

[02:28:28 - 02:28:36]
written everywhere ground level shot aerial shot this is

[02:28:36 - 02:28:44]
drone shot webcam style shot this is literally webcam style

[02:28:44 - 02:28:48]
shot this is webcam style

[02:28:49 - 02:28:55]
underwater shot underwater close up shot

[02:28:55 - 02:29:01]
I hope you understood this if not, don't worry

[02:29:01 - 02:29:06]
I will give you the complete list you just need to copy

[02:29:06 - 02:29:10]
paste this it is important for me
