[00:00 - 00:04]
ladies and gentlemen I'm with Sam Alman

[00:02 - 00:05]
and Sam uh I've seen a bunch of your

[00:04 - 00:07]
tweets over the last few days they're

[00:05 - 00:08]
called posts now they're called X's now

[00:07 - 00:09]
i, don't know, what, they're, called, anymore

[00:08 - 00:10]
i don't know what they're called i still

[00:09 - 00:12]
call them tweets you've been tweeting a

[00:10 - 00:14]
lot about India you've also been

[00:12 - 00:16]
tweeting a lot about the new image gen

[00:14 - 00:18]
firstly I want to say I've had early

[00:16 - 00:20]
access to the the photo image gen thing

[00:18 - 00:23]
it's been great everything from mood

[00:20 - 00:25]
boarding making images UI it's just been

[00:23 - 00:27]
phenomenal in fact it's also very smart

[00:25 - 00:28]
so we've been we have this very clever

[00:27 - 00:30]
use case where we're generating the

[00:28 - 00:32]
front view of a 3D model and then asking

[00:30 - 00:35]
it for the left side view the right side

[00:32 - 00:36]
view the view behind and then we're

[00:35 - 00:38]
throwing that into you know another

[00:36 - 00:40]
model that generates the mesh and then

[00:38 - 00:42]
reproing these textures on top and then

[00:40 - 00:44]
also asking it to generate height maps

[00:42 - 00:46]
which is just the insanity of this

[00:44 - 00:48]
existing where it didn't exist a couple

[00:46 - 00:50]
of months ago is just it it's it blows

[00:48 - 00:52]
my mind what's the response been like

[00:50 - 00:54]
any numbers for us i I don't know if I

[00:52 - 00:56]
can share an exact number but like way

[00:54 - 01:01]
more images than I thought the internet

[00:56 - 01:04]
had uh like appetite to to do like the

[01:01 - 01:06]
um we will cross a billion total images

[01:04 - 01:08]
in the notistant future i can say that

[01:06 - 01:09]
oh man that that's a huge number and

[01:08 - 01:11]
what's the response like any any

[01:09 - 01:12]
creative use cases that you've seen on

[01:11 - 01:15]
on images so far apart from you know

[01:12 - 01:16]
animating yourself yeah I I mean the the

[01:15 - 01:18]
thing that's been exciting to me is just

[01:16 - 01:21]
the breadth of creative use cases

[01:18 - 01:23]
obviously turning yourself into anime

[01:21 - 01:25]
was the one that kind of first lit up on

[01:23 - 01:27]
the internet but but it's been amazing

[01:25 - 01:29]
to see the sort of creative expression

[01:27 - 01:31]
people making just really new kinds of

[01:29 - 01:33]
images I had never thought about before

[01:31 - 01:34]
um there's obviously a lot of great

[01:33 - 01:36]
commercial use cases too where people

[01:34 - 01:38]
are you know using this in their small

[01:36 - 01:40]
business for new logos or graphic design

[01:38 - 01:42]
or whatever but but really the creative

[01:40 - 01:44]
spirit of people just doing things that

[01:42 - 01:45]
you know images kinds of images that

[01:44 - 01:47]
I've never seen exist before that's

[01:45 - 01:49]
that's been to me quite exciting and and

[01:47 - 01:51]
has India contributed i mean I think

[01:49 - 01:54]
India has been a big user of this from

[01:51 - 01:55]
your, tweets, at least, india, I, I, believe

[01:54 - 01:58]
is our fastest growing market now um

[01:55 - 02:00]
India's been been very special to us for

[01:58 - 02:02]
a long time um India was one of the

[02:00 - 02:05]
first markets outside the US that really

[02:02 - 02:07]
jumped on AI in a huge huge way and

[02:05 - 02:09]
since this moment has happened it is now

[02:07 - 02:11]
our I'm pretty sure it's our fastest

[02:09 - 02:13]
growing market wow that's that's that's

[02:11 - 02:15]
so it's been very cool to see that's

[02:13 - 02:16]
crazy too and and have you seen Indians

[02:15 - 02:18]
also use things outside of imagen have

[02:16 - 02:21]
you seen them use deep research are they

[02:18 - 02:23]
a paying market uh I was in India a

[02:21 - 02:24]
couple of months ago and the that was

[02:23 - 02:26]
obviously before image genen and you

[02:24 - 02:28]
know it was like non-stop stories from

[02:26 - 02:31]
people about what they were using chatbt

[02:28 - 02:34]
for um what what they were using chatbt

[02:31 - 02:36]
to do not catch 40 um but but it was

[02:34 - 02:38]
really it's like quite incredible the

[02:36 - 02:40]
degree to which it has permeated Indian

[02:38 - 02:42]
society for for all sorts of things you

[02:40 - 02:43]
know certainly we get feedback that our

[02:42 - 02:45]
price point is too high for mass

[02:43 - 02:46]
adoption in the Indian market and we're

[02:45 - 02:47]
looking at things to do there

[02:46 - 02:49]
unfortunately our compute costs are

[02:47 - 02:51]
still just quite high but we are hard at

[02:49 - 02:52]
work on more efficient models and I'm

[02:51 - 02:55]
optimistic we'll be able to bring cost

[02:52 - 02:56]
down over time amazing and I want to

[02:55 - 02:59]
touch upon the other side of this right

[02:56 - 03:01]
which is the UI and design jobs for a

[02:59 - 03:03]
second you know we thought when these

[03:01 - 03:05]
tools come out came out a year ago that

[03:03 - 03:07]
well we're going to have you know these

[03:05 - 03:08]
tools do most of the work for us but you

[03:07 - 03:10]
know in our own company we have a bunch

[03:08 - 03:13]
of people who are video editors we have

[03:10 - 03:15]
people who are designers and it turns

[03:13 - 03:16]
out we still need a person to run the

[03:15 - 03:18]
tool because humans still need

[03:16 - 03:20]
accountability someone maintaining

[03:18 - 03:22]
context and it's almost like the manager

[03:20 - 03:24]
of the tool in some senses right uh is

[03:22 - 03:26]
this how is this how jobs are going to

[03:24 - 03:28]
evolve is have you seen something

[03:26 - 03:30]
similar, or, do, you, have, a, do, you, have a

[03:28 - 03:31]
path for how jobs will evolve now that

[03:30 - 03:33]
these sort of tools are here I think

[03:31 - 03:34]
it's going to be uneven and it'll be

[03:33 - 03:37]
different for different kinds of jobs

[03:34 - 03:39]
there will be some jobs that are that

[03:37 - 03:41]
totally go away where the AI just does

[03:39 - 03:43]
them end to And mostly I think it'll be

[03:41 - 03:45]
a case of a new tool where people are

[03:43 - 03:47]
just much more productive and can do

[03:45 - 03:49]
work at a higher quality so there will

[03:47 - 03:52]
still be people that are in charge of

[03:49 - 03:53]
you know making a website look great but

[03:52 - 03:55]
the expectations of how good a website

[03:53 - 03:57]
looks just go up a lot and we all get

[03:55 - 03:59]
better stuff uh in fact maybe we get

[03:57 - 04:01]
more maybe there's more demand for that

[03:59 - 04:04]
in, a, world, like, that, that that, I, think

[04:01 - 04:06]
can cut many different ways um and then

[04:04 - 04:08]
there will be totally new classes of

[04:06 - 04:10]
jobs that we just haven't seen before at

[04:08 - 04:12]
all yeah yeah do you have examples so

[04:10 - 04:13]
far there are some kinds of customer

[04:12 - 04:15]
support where I think an AI can just do

[04:13 - 04:17]
that end to end and that'd be in the

[04:15 - 04:19]
first category in the second since we're

[04:17 - 04:22]
on this example of graphic designers you

[04:19 - 04:23]
know taste still really matters and like

[04:22 - 04:26]
the

[04:23 - 04:28]
the you know when we went from graphic

[04:26 - 04:30]
designers had to do everything with like

[04:28 - 04:31]
uh paper and pencil or you know pens and

[04:30 - 04:33]
paper whatever you want to call it to

[04:31 - 04:34]
having computer tools they were able to

[04:33 - 04:36]
do more and do better but we still

[04:34 - 04:40]
needed a lot of good graphic design in

[04:36 - 04:42]
the world um we can now have a new tool

[04:40 - 04:45]
but and and no doubt it's going to

[04:42 - 04:47]
change the workflow of a graphic

[04:45 - 04:48]
designer and some things that some

[04:47 - 04:51]
people were paid for they won't be paid

[04:48 - 04:55]
for those tasks but what it appears to

[04:51 - 04:57]
me will happen is you will still need

[04:55 - 05:00]
some sort of job which is you know make

[04:57 - 05:02]
this website look beautiful um

[05:00 - 05:04]
and maybe there are fewer people that do

[05:02 - 05:05]
that but they make much more money maybe

[05:04 - 05:08]
there are more people that do it because

[05:05 - 05:10]
we just have a you know explosion of how

[05:08 - 05:12]
many websites we can get like may maybe

[05:10 - 05:13]
it turns out there was way more demand

[05:12 - 05:15]
for graphic design in the world than

[05:13 - 05:16]
than we could sort of like afford to

[05:15 - 05:18]
fill i think we just don't know on that

[05:16 - 05:20]
yet um and then there's other and then

[05:18 - 05:22]
in terms of like entirely new jobs you

[05:20 - 05:23]
know the first example we saw of that

[05:22 - 05:25]
was prompt

[05:23 - 05:27]
engineer before AI came along there was

[05:25 - 05:29]
no such thing as a prompt engineer not

[05:27 - 05:30]
only that there was no it would have

[05:29 - 05:33]
been hard to conceptualize that there

[05:30 - 05:35]
would be such a job um there's there's

[05:33 - 05:36]
many more but that's the example I give

[05:35 - 05:38]
is the sort of near and dear to my heart

[05:36 - 05:40]
one and it's so funny when whenever some

[05:38 - 05:41]
of these, new, jobs, come, in, they're, always

[05:40 - 05:42]
ridiculed at first right like even

[05:41 - 05:44]
building rappers and we'll come to that

[05:42 - 05:45]
in a bit but even with prompt engineer a

[05:44 - 05:46]
lot of people still don't take it

[05:45 - 05:48]
seriously, well, all, you're, going to, do, is

[05:46 - 05:50]
write English do you have a do you have

[05:48 - 05:52]
a defense for that do you feel there's

[05:50 - 05:54]
there's some way to you know make the

[05:52 - 05:56]
people who are now going to be prompt

[05:54 - 05:58]
engineers feel a little more you know

[05:56 - 06:01]
like they're not losing status for doing

[05:58 - 06:04]
it when I was young um I knew I wanted

[06:01 - 06:06]
to go study computer programming

[06:04 - 06:08]
and the adults in my life would say "Oh

[06:06 - 06:09]
that's like that's a hobby job these

[06:08 - 06:11]
computers, aren't, going to, go, anywhere

[06:09 - 06:13]
you need to go be a doctor or a lawyer

[06:11 - 06:15]
like you need to get a real stable job."

[06:13 - 06:19]
You know this is like a this is a

[06:15 - 06:20]
dangerous path to go down um and I

[06:19 - 06:24]
thought I understood something that they

[06:20 - 06:27]
didn't and I think I really encourage

[06:24 - 06:28]
people to have their own conviction on

[06:27 - 06:31]
what things are going to be like and

[06:28 - 06:33]
just because something is not

[06:31 - 06:36]
a just because something is not a

[06:33 - 06:37]
historically valuable or high status job

[06:36 - 06:39]
doesn't mean it won't be in the future

[06:37 - 06:41]
um this is this is like the way of

[06:39 - 06:42]
technological progress you know for

[06:41 - 06:44]
people that are watching there's a post

[06:42 - 06:46]
by Sam Alman on this which is the

[06:44 - 06:48]
strength to be misunderstood i love that

[06:46 - 06:49]
that blog post by the way so thank you

[06:48 - 06:51]
so much for that you wrote it many years

[06:49 - 06:53]
ago i think it was it was very

[06:51 - 06:54]
insightful when I decided to become a

[06:53 - 06:56]
content creator and it was a low status

[06:54 - 06:59]
job back then i was going to say about

[06:56 - 07:01]
your job you know I

[06:59 - 07:04]
remember you know like 10 years ago or

[07:01 - 07:06]
something uh I would like I would meet

[07:04 - 07:07]
people I I was you know I would go talk

[07:06 - 07:09]
about doing startups or whatever and I I

[07:07 - 07:11]
would like go meet young people who

[07:09 - 07:13]
wanted to start startups and I always

[07:11 - 07:14]
kind of like asked people what they

[07:13 - 07:16]
wanted to be or what they thought the

[07:14 - 07:18]
interesting industries were because I

[07:16 - 07:20]
think if you kind of like

[07:18 - 07:22]
ask young people that you get a you get

[07:20 - 07:24]
a perspective that is interesting and

[07:22 - 07:26]
different and usually right and every

[07:24 - 07:29]
not everybody many people said they

[07:26 - 07:32]
wanted to be a YouTuber at the time i

[07:29 - 07:34]
was like what but I I it hit me then

[07:32 - 07:35]
that I'm like ah I cannot dismiss this

[07:34 - 07:37]
like people dismissed computer

[07:35 - 07:38]
programmer when I was young yeah i I

[07:37 - 07:40]
want to touch upon something else that

[07:38 - 07:42]
the internet's been sort of debating

[07:40 - 07:45]
over the last few days which is you know

[07:42 - 07:46]
there's this video of Miyazaki so of

[07:45 - 07:48]
course it's an out of context video

[07:46 - 07:50]
where he's looking at a model from you

[07:48 - 07:52]
know many years ago something some

[07:50 - 07:53]
creature thrashing around and he said

[07:52 - 07:54]
that well you know I don't like this

[07:53 - 07:56]
essentially that was the the you know

[07:54 - 07:58]
the summary of what he said you know as

[07:56 - 08:02]
an artist who's been making videos for n

[07:58 - 08:03]
9 years I feel some of the craft and the

[08:02 - 08:05]
you know the effort I'd have to put in

[08:03 - 08:08]
to make an image or even to make a video

[08:05 - 08:10]
has dropped over the years and it is a

[08:08 - 08:11]
little bit upsetting it it feels like

[08:10 - 08:13]
it's a little bit of a bummer as an

[08:11 - 08:14]
artist right but as an entrepreneur as

[08:13 - 08:16]
somebody now that has a team to manage

[08:14 - 08:19]
and worry about their salaries and

[08:16 - 08:20]
payroll and whatnot it is very good that

[08:19 - 08:22]
this technology exists because it helps

[08:20 - 08:24]
me go a little bit faster right it helps

[08:22 - 08:26]
me you know make sure that I'm I'm

[08:24 - 08:29]
dealing with a lot a lot less stress do

[08:26 - 08:30]
you have a view on um you know how the

[08:29 - 08:32]
internet should think about this

[08:30 - 08:36]
evolving nature of art i think what it

[08:32 - 08:41]
was like to try to um do what you do 30

[08:36 - 08:43]
years ago it was impossible or very hard

[08:41 - 08:45]
i mean you'd need like a camcorder and

[08:43 - 08:47]
like VHS tapes and then you'd have to

[08:45 - 08:48]
like edit it in some complicated way and

[08:47 - 08:51]
then even if you did that you would have

[08:48 - 08:53]
to like distribute tapes because there

[08:51 - 08:55]
was no internet and no YouTube or there

[08:53 - 08:56]
wasn't internet but it wasn't very good

[08:55 - 09:00]
and now

[08:56 - 09:01]
like anybody on earth can get a

[09:00 - 09:02]
smartphone and record themselves and put

[09:01 - 09:04]
it up and if they have something

[09:02 - 09:06]
interesting to

[09:04 - 09:09]
say they get it out there and the world

[09:06 - 09:09]
benefits from that

[09:11 - 09:17]
um I think the democratization of

[09:14 - 09:19]
creating content has been a big netwin

[09:17 - 09:22]
for society it has not been a complete

[09:19 - 09:25]
win there are negative things about it

[09:22 - 09:27]
for sure and certainly it did something

[09:25 - 09:30]
about

[09:27 - 09:33]
the the art form but I think on the

[09:30 - 09:34]
whole it's been a win and this is

[09:33 - 09:37]
something that I very deeply believe

[09:34 - 09:42]
about the power of technology which

[09:37 - 09:44]
is giving everyone more tools making

[09:42 - 09:49]
things easier lowering the barriers to

[09:44 - 09:51]
entry um does significantly increase the

[09:49 - 09:54]
number of people that can contribute to

[09:51 - 09:56]
society and we all benefit from that

[09:54 - 09:57]
overall doesn't mean that it doesn't

[09:56 - 10:00]
like cause some job loss and some people

[09:57 - 10:02]
who had a sort of differential ability

[10:00 - 10:04]
to do something now have a lot more

[10:02 - 10:06]
competition but overall I think it's a

[10:04 - 10:08]
real benefit to society

[10:06 - 10:10]
um my own experience of this was

[10:08 - 10:15]
watching the barrier to entry to

[10:10 - 10:17]
starting a company really change um this

[10:15 - 10:19]
happened when it got cheaper to start a

[10:17 - 10:21]
company because of a whole bunch of

[10:19 - 10:23]
things but AWS was one of the biggest

[10:21 - 10:25]
and most important moments access to the

[10:23 - 10:27]
internet in general was was another big

[10:25 - 10:29]
one and there was a shift that Y

[10:27 - 10:30]
Combinator I think really helped drive

[10:29 - 10:34]
or popularize whatever you want to call

[10:30 - 10:36]
it uh starting in 2005 where young

[10:34 - 10:38]
technical founders could all of a sudden

[10:36 - 10:42]
much more easily start companies and

[10:38 - 10:44]
that led to an explosion of great new

[10:42 - 10:46]
products and technologies that the world

[10:44 - 10:47]
got to benefit from now some of the

[10:46 - 10:49]
people that those companies competed

[10:47 - 10:51]
with probably wish that hadn't happened

[10:49 - 10:54]
but as a citizen of the world there was

[10:51 - 10:56]
a lot more stuff openai itself I think

[10:54 - 10:59]
was an example of a company

[10:56 - 11:01]
that only got to happen because the

[10:59 - 11:03]
barriers to entry to a bunch of

[11:01 - 11:05]
different pieces of technology stack got

[11:03 - 11:06]
significantly low and this ragtag bunch

[11:05 - 11:09]
of us were able to just do something we

[11:06 - 11:11]
had no right to do yeah I think I agree

[11:09 - 11:13]
with you i think especially after Stripe

[11:11 - 11:15]
and in India after UPI there's just been

[11:13 - 11:16]
an explosion of new companies new new

[11:15 - 11:18]
types of things that were just not

[11:16 - 11:20]
possible because the amount of red tape

[11:18 - 11:22]
that it required to even get started i

[11:20 - 11:24]
assume now it's sort of become the same

[11:22 - 11:27]
in design in fact on the note of YC

[11:24 - 11:28]
right I actually you know I want to ask

[11:27 - 11:31]
you to put on your 20-year-old when you

[11:28 - 11:33]
were a 20-year-old hat of you know going

[11:31 - 11:35]
to YC again if you knew everything you

[11:33 - 11:36]
knew right now and the debate was you

[11:35 - 11:38]
should build a rapper or no you

[11:36 - 11:39]
shouldn't build a rapper OpenAI would

[11:38 - 11:40]
probably kill your startup or on the

[11:39 - 11:42]
other side foundational models are

[11:40 - 11:43]
worthless rappers are the only ones that

[11:42 - 11:46]
are making money and able to raise money

[11:43 - 11:47]
and whatnot um what would you do knowing

[11:46 - 11:49]
everything you knew but also with the

[11:47 - 11:53]
ability to shut out the noise i think

[11:49 - 11:55]
the whole like oh your startup is just a

[11:53 - 11:57]
rapper or oh like people used to say

[11:55 - 11:58]
that about other categories too you know

[11:57 - 12:04]
there was a time when people say well

[11:58 - 12:04]
you're just a rapper on AWS probably um

[12:04 - 12:11]
the people are building absolutely

[12:07 - 12:13]
incredible new companies based off of AI

[12:11 - 12:16]
most of them will fail or not do that

[12:13 - 12:18]
well but some of them will find a really

[12:16 - 12:22]
enduring business and generate a ton of

[12:18 - 12:23]
value and that's that's always the case

[12:22 - 12:25]
that's just how the world work like you

[12:23 - 12:28]
know most startups fail and some really

[12:25 - 12:28]
succeed

[12:29 - 12:34]
and it's easy to sound smart and to just

[12:32 - 12:37]
dismiss everything as a rapper or some

[12:34 - 12:39]
thin thing that's not going to you

[12:37 - 12:41]
know create much value and I remember

[12:39 - 12:43]
when people used to say very similar

[12:41 - 12:46]
things about open AAI yeah what was it

[12:43 - 12:48]
what was the they used to say

[12:46 - 12:49]
you're just you know you're just like a

[12:48 - 12:51]
little research lab and Google's going

[12:49 - 12:53]
to crush you and like you're just

[12:51 - 12:55]
putting this like thin layer on or

[12:53 - 12:57]
Nvidia is going to get all the value or

[12:55 - 12:59]
you're going to like you're doing this

[12:57 - 13:00]
like little thing and it's impossible to

[12:59 - 13:01]
compete with the big tech companies and

[13:00 - 13:04]
it was not long ago they were saying

[13:01 - 13:05]
this this is a couple years ago so I

[13:04 - 13:09]
don't know

[13:05 - 13:10]
i it sounds very cool and sophisticated

[13:09 - 13:13]
to always say why things aren't going to

[13:10 - 13:15]
work and you will be right most of the

[13:13 - 13:17]
time um and kind of the the most

[13:15 - 13:21]
important lesson I think you can learn

[13:17 - 13:22]
as an entrepreneur is that that or an

[13:21 - 13:27]
investor is that that is not how great

[13:22 - 13:27]
companies get built or invested in

[13:27 - 13:32]
so I think if I were 20 in NYC right now

[13:30 - 13:35]
and someone was calling my company a GPT

[13:32 - 13:36]
rapper I'd be like "Ah I'm I must be you

[13:35 - 13:38]
know in a promising direction." Do you

[13:36 - 13:40]
do you have any specific ideas that you

[13:38 - 13:42]
would be working on if you were 20 but

[13:40 - 13:44]
you were not an open AI you didn't have

[13:42 - 13:46]
the resources you had 500K as a matter

[13:44 - 13:49]
of principle I try to never answer that

[13:46 - 13:51]
question because I I the thing I care

[13:49 - 13:55]
about most is that people don't start

[13:51 - 13:55]
someone else's company like you

[13:58 - 14:02]
you the ideas that I have for companies

[14:00 - 14:06]
are probably mid at

[14:02 - 14:08]
best and the idea that some 20-year-old

[14:06 - 14:09]
doing YC right now that has a company

[14:08 - 14:11]
that has an idea for a company that

[14:09 - 14:14]
sounds totally crazy and bad to me

[14:11 - 14:15]
that's probably the next open AI and I

[14:14 - 14:17]
never want to discourage anyone from

[14:15 - 14:20]
that by saying some like safe middle of

[14:17 - 14:22]
the road like out of touch idea so go do

[14:20 - 14:24]
your crazy idea it's my advice that

[14:22 - 14:25]
makes sense it's almost like you need to

[14:24 - 14:26]
do what you're passionate about

[14:25 - 14:28]
otherwise you never end up building a

[14:26 - 14:30]
Snapchat because everyone would think it

[14:28 - 14:32]
was a bad idea on day one um that's

[14:30 - 14:35]
amazing Sam you know we did a we did a

[14:32 - 14:37]
podcast with Kevin uh your CPO the other

[14:35 - 14:38]
day and he gave me a timeline for when

[14:37 - 14:41]
code is going to be automated he said

[14:38 - 14:43]
2025 anthropic said 2027 he said "No we

[14:41 - 14:45]
can do better we'll do 2025 or maybe

[14:43 - 14:47]
2026." Um now that we know everything we

[14:45 - 14:50]
know do you have a timeline for when you

[14:47 - 14:51]
know a lot of writing code becomes

[14:50 - 14:53]
English

[14:51 - 14:54]
or is that not going to happen i think

[14:53 - 14:57]
it's the degree of automation that

[14:54 - 14:59]
matters to get to 100 truly 100%

[14:57 - 15:01]
automation you know you can make a

[14:59 - 15:04]
complex thing and never touch

[15:01 - 15:07]
code that that's one thing

[15:04 - 15:12]
but I'm less interested in that question

[15:07 - 15:12]
than when a coder becomes 10 times more

[15:12 - 15:15]
productive and I think that could happen

[15:14 - 15:17]
this year next year something like that

[15:15 - 15:18]
so a coder is 10x more productive i

[15:17 - 15:21]
think a coder is already several times

[15:18 - 15:23]
more productive i think there's already

[15:21 - 15:24]
like, at least, in, you, know, the, way, people

[15:23 - 15:26]
around me have started working the good

[15:24 - 15:27]
ones who've adopted the yeah people

[15:26 - 15:30]
maybe say 2x 3x but I haven't heard

[15:27 - 15:33]
anyone I haven't heard many people I

[15:30 - 15:34]
have not heard a consensus for 10x yet

[15:33 - 15:38]
but you think that by next year it's

[15:34 - 15:39]
going to be a a 10x step function look

[15:38 - 15:40]
predictions especially predictions with

[15:39 - 15:43]
the timeline attached are always

[15:40 - 15:45]
difficult but I think we can aim at that

[15:43 - 15:46]
yeah interesting you know there's there

[15:45 - 15:48]
is a negative side to this right which

[15:46 - 15:50]
is that you know Daniel Grath had this

[15:48 - 15:52]
this one article where he said that $250

[15:50 - 15:56]
billion of India's exports are actually

[15:52 - 15:58]
IT services and if you think from that

[15:56 - 16:01]
angle that could just be GBD4 tokens

[15:58 - 16:03]
right or GDP5 tokens at some point for

[16:01 - 16:05]
India that $250 billion is very

[16:03 - 16:07]
important and not all of those engineers

[16:05 - 16:09]
are building are are elite engineers who

[16:07 - 16:11]
will benefit from this technology and go

[16:09 - 16:12]
10x right some of them are still

[16:11 - 16:14]
building simple crab crowd apps and

[16:12 - 16:16]
there is competition from the 10x

[16:14 - 16:18]
engineer maybe not from AI itself but an

[16:16 - 16:19]
engineer using the AI and sort of

[16:18 - 16:20]
outpacing them and It's they're able to

[16:19 - 16:22]
do this at much cheaper right because

[16:20 - 16:24]
the tokens are of course cheaper do you

[16:22 - 16:26]
have something that India can do uh to

[16:24 - 16:28]
actually make sure we absorb some of

[16:26 - 16:31]
that we we continue to be relevant there

[16:28 - 16:33]
if there's one area that I think I think

[16:31 - 16:34]
this is an important general question

[16:33 - 16:36]
but if there's one area where I think

[16:34 - 16:38]
that the world just has so much more

[16:36 - 16:39]
demand than we can currently supply it's

[16:38 - 16:42]
for

[16:39 - 16:45]
codewritten my my belief is that the

[16:42 - 16:47]
world just wants way more software and

[16:45 - 16:51]
is about to get it and if you give

[16:47 - 16:52]
people these tools to write software

[16:51 - 16:56]
much more

[16:52 - 16:58]
effectively, I, at least, think, for, a, while

[16:56 - 17:00]
what will happen is someone who today

[16:58 - 17:03]
can write code at some value will be

[17:00 - 17:05]
able to write code or create software

[17:03 - 17:07]
let's say at some much higher value now

[17:05 - 17:09]
they have to pay the AI a lot so they

[17:07 - 17:11]
won't capture all of that um and also

[17:09 - 17:13]
the market price for a piece of code

[17:11 - 17:14]
will go down but I I would bet this is

[17:13 - 17:17]
an example everyone seems obsessed with

[17:14 - 17:18]
Jevans paradox all of a sudden and I

[17:17 - 17:20]
would bet this will be an example of it

[17:18 - 17:22]
so a lot more software being built so

[17:20 - 17:23]
this it might it might the cost might

[17:22 - 17:27]
drop a certain amount but then also

[17:23 - 17:29]
demand goes up by that amount i think so

[17:27 - 17:30]
interesting that's very reassuring to

[17:29 - 17:31]
hear actually i don't think it's going

[17:30 - 17:32]
to be like that i don't I don't want to

[17:31 - 17:33]
like dodge the question because I don't

[17:32 - 17:35]
think it'll be like that in every

[17:33 - 17:37]
industry but code is one where I would

[17:35 - 17:39]
guess it's like that and and do you see

[17:37 - 17:41]
a lot of these I mean we've been seeing

[17:39 - 17:42]
sort of early agents right we've seen

[17:41 - 17:44]
deep research d research has been great

[17:42 - 17:45]
but DP is also a passive agent it's not

[17:44 - 17:48]
taking my card and doing something with

[17:45 - 17:51]
it so there's there's low DP research is

[17:48 - 17:53]
low risk um I've seen that you have been

[17:51 - 17:54]
very bullish about agents there are lots

[17:53 - 17:55]
of businesses that have been very

[17:54 - 17:57]
bullish about lots of other companies

[17:55 - 18:00]
that have been bullish about agents um

[17:57 - 18:02]
do you have do you have something in

[18:00 - 18:04]
mind for what agents will become over

[18:02 - 18:06]
the end of this year or by by next year

[18:04 - 18:08]
and some use cases that you think we'll

[18:06 - 18:09]
see on an everyday basis with agents

[18:08 - 18:11]
just to stick with the code example

[18:09 - 18:14]
because we're on that i I think this

[18:11 - 18:17]
idea that you can like say to a coding

[18:14 - 18:20]
agent um I would like this new feature

[18:17 - 18:22]
built and it goes off and pings you back

[18:20 - 18:23]
you know some period of time later and

[18:22 - 18:25]
says okay here's the pull request ready

[18:23 - 18:29]
to

[18:25 - 18:31]
go that I think will feel very crazy to

[18:29 - 18:32]
people there's other categories where it

[18:31 - 18:34]
kind of goes off and does stuff for you

[18:32 - 18:38]
on the internet operator points at that

[18:34 - 18:40]
a little bit um but I would expect the

[18:38 - 18:42]
coding one to be a big a big

[18:40 - 18:44]
anything on a consumer use case like

[18:42 - 18:46]
something like booking your your food or

[18:44 - 18:47]
something ordering a cab or something

[18:46 - 18:50]
like that that's the kind of thing that

[18:47 - 18:53]
I very much expect to happen and that

[18:50 - 18:54]
that'll feel like a very agentic task

[18:53 - 18:57]
let me ask you another question which is

[18:54 - 18:58]
if you were an employee at a job but you

[18:57 - 19:00]
were working at a legacy company let's

[18:58 - 19:01]
say they were slow to adopt all this

[19:00 - 19:03]
technology they're not even aware that

[19:01 - 19:05]
you know maybe they've tried it in

[19:03 - 19:07]
passing they've seen a GPD3 and they've

[19:05 - 19:09]
become dismissive about and lots of

[19:07 - 19:10]
legacy companies are like this if you

[19:09 - 19:12]
were sitting in that company and you

[19:10 - 19:13]
were unable to convince your company to

[19:12 - 19:16]
use these new tools because of

[19:13 - 19:18]
bureaucracy or whatever reason would you

[19:16 - 19:19]
what would your career plan be then

[19:18 - 19:20]
would you move to a faster moving

[19:19 - 19:22]
company but also you know take on the

[19:20 - 19:23]
risk of that company probably I would do

[19:22 - 19:25]
that

[19:23 - 19:27]
yeah both because I think companies that

[19:25 - 19:28]
don't adopt these things will be in a

[19:27 - 19:29]
tough place most I mean there's some

[19:28 - 19:32]
categories of companies that of course

[19:29 - 19:34]
be fine but also because I'd want to be

[19:32 - 19:36]
responsible for my own career success

[19:34 - 19:39]
and I'd want to make sure I was learning

[19:36 - 19:41]
and you know if I felt like I was not

[19:39 - 19:43]
getting exposure to these tools it would

[19:41 - 19:45]
seem super broken that makes sense okay

[19:43 - 19:47]
one last question and then we should be

[19:45 - 19:49]
good um can you give me a

[19:47 - 19:51]
counterintuitive insight you've had

[19:49 - 19:52]
about AI worked here for a very long

[19:51 - 19:54]
time of your life and you've done a

[19:52 - 19:55]
bunch of things you've done YC where

[19:54 - 19:57]
you've invested in companies you've

[19:55 - 19:59]
you've you've been around the valley for

[19:57 - 20:01]
a very long period of time what is

[19:59 - 20:03]
something you thought about AI but you

[20:01 - 20:05]
have a totally different experience now

[20:03 - 20:06]
i somehow thought it was going to be a

[20:05 - 20:10]
bigger change to society than it's

[20:06 - 20:15]
turned, out, to, be, um, you, know, I, I I, I, had

[20:10 - 20:17]
this sort of like sci-fi like vision of

[20:15 - 20:19]
what AI was going to be like and maybe

[20:17 - 20:21]
it'll still get there but right now it's

[20:19 - 20:24]
just this like crazy powerful tool and

[20:21 - 20:25]
life goes on mostly the same and and I'm

[20:24 - 20:27]
actually very happy about that i think

[20:25 - 20:29]
that's good i think I was naive before i

[20:27 - 20:31]
also think that would have been bad but

[20:29 - 20:33]
it's it it's very different than I kind

[20:31 - 20:36]
of imagined it 10 years

[20:33 - 20:37]
ago but I think I think that's wonderful

[20:36 - 20:39]
yeah I think that's wonderful too i

[20:37 - 20:41]
think you know having godlike technology

[20:39 - 20:45]
being able to solve at some point

[20:41 - 20:46]
medicine and help us do less of the work

[20:45 - 20:49]
we hate but more of the work we enjoy I

[20:46 - 20:50]
think is is is net good and I hope that

[20:49 - 20:54]
you know everyone benefits from it at

[20:50 - 20:56]
some point um thank you Sam uh this was

[20:54 - 20:57]
this was a wonderful interview thank you

[20:56 - 20:59]
so much for being support and and doing

For the first 3 seconds, I was checking whether it was actually Varun interviewing or AI Varun XD

As of now, he can really be ai too

“As a 17-year-old in India preparing for JEE and building on AI ideas during breaks, this podcast hit hard. Sam’s vision + Varun’s sharp questioning = pure gold. One day, I hope to sit across the table with you both, not as a fan — but as a fellow builder.”

> **@LinkVerse1** (👍 205): Just a speculation, and I could be wrong - but this reads like an AI-written comment. Em dashes are kind of a giveaway. Unless you're trying to make it obvious, of course.

> **@ShouryaAsati** (👍 0): @LinkVerse1  honestly you are wrong mf

> **@rohankumarvg** (👍 120): ​@@LinkVerse1 Shhh... Don't tell them that. Most of them can't even tell the difference between an em dash and a hyphen. Also, he didn’t remove the double quotation marks before copy-pasting.

> **@ShouryaAsati** (👍 24): @@rohankumarvg just needed a little phrasing it may be but the thoughts are mine bro

> **@shaanjohari2316** (👍 10): @@LinkVerse1 Tbh dashes have made this image that if its present, in a sentence it must be AI, as someone who is a copywriter, we use dashes all the time, Its just an unjustified bias at the end.

I think Varun's content over the years and especially in the last years regarding the progress of AI is impacting and will continue to impact so many new divers in this industry, He is one of the very few people in tech India that I can take any word for.

> **@user-xr1my7tm6o** (👍 0): True

### 4. @akshayseth4489 (👍 13)
India need more podcasters like you, The way Varun asked questions blew my mind, very less podcasters can do that, this art can only be felt by viewers, Can't explain in words. Good work, I would say Great work.

### 5. @UmeshSharma-zk3pd (👍 70)
Still remember vibing in the Avalon meta telegram group and Avalon Discord back in 2020.
Varun's journey and success has been so inspiring and feels so personal. Kudos to him and the team.

### 6. @beerusgaming7 (👍 79)
Varun is making a significant impact in India regarding AI, even though he isn't a PhD student or a data scientist/AI engineer. While he can't participate in conferences like NeurIPS or ICLR, he still has the opportunity to engage with leaders in the tech industry and many others. You are a wonderful content creator, Varun, and your storytelling skills have improved tremendously over the years!

> **@VarunMayya** (👍 22): Wait till you find out about Aeos :D

> **@abhinavmenon9140** (👍 7): He should have asked him about his role in the death of Suchir.

> **@chiragsharma5050** (👍 3): That's why he speaks shit

> **@beerusgaming7** (👍 3): @VarunMayya I'll wait until you publish a paper at these conferences, and I will meet you there.

> **@aswinkr5674** (👍 2): Varun this conversation is interesting, but don't pour too much petrol to the spreading Open AI fire in India. They are collecting too much facial biometric data from India which is going to help them to train their their new model for the US military which Open AI has been partnered with. Who knows how it gonna affect the humanity. Which is so scary😱. Also support India in some way to build atleast 1 LLM asap!! Make videos about Yotta and Tata or the Reliance AI infrastructure which is in the work.

### 7. @AyanKhan-mb1dp (👍 65)
I'm impressed that every single question Varun asked is so deeply thought out that it gives us deep insight into Sam's vision. Keep it up varun 🙌🏻

### 8. @fowadkhan5938 (👍 63)
The irony of the matter is, he speaks of all these new possibilities that were once unseen and are now visible — yet, in embracing them, we stand to lose more than we gain. Not every actor can become a director, nor the other way around. You can't simply rewrite the dynamics of the social fabric. Work exists because some can do what others cannot — but now, you're expecting one person to do everything, even when they're clearly not equipped to handle it.”

### 20. @SaimonSaikia (👍 1)
I'm a 16 year old from India..who have gained quite experience in building automation tools and desktop applications based on AI the past couple of years...and I'm working towards building a semi-concious AI system in 7-8 years. I believe that this, should be yet another tech revolution if not in it's early stages, but surely through industry adoption and evolution over time. Wish me luck
