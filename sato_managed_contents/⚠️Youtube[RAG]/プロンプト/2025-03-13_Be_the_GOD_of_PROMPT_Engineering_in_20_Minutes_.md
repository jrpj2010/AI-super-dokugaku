## Â≠óÂπï

[00:00 - 00:02]
Imagine that you're solving a critical problem

[00:02 - 00:07]
now you need an extra hand for it & for that help, you visit Chat GPT

[00:07 - 00:09]
you spend some time to think and write a prompt.

[00:13 - 00:18]
But you give basic random prompts to Chat GPT, so it isn't able to help you properly and

[00:18 - 00:21]
in return it provides you a very generic & surface level information.

[00:21 - 00:25]
I know many of you don't write prompt like this.

[00:25 - 00:28]
You tweak your prompt according to your experience

[00:28 - 00:31]
and through this tweaks, many -a- times magic happens.

[00:31 - 00:36]
Now by writing any prompt according to a specific need, you get very good results.

[00:36 - 00:40]
Now, many people do it but most of the people - 'shoot an arrow in the dark'.

[00:41 - 00:45]
Now with that, sometimes you get very good results, sometimes you get very bad results.

[00:45 - 00:49]
Now you often write a bigger prompt according to your experience, add more details

[00:49 - 00:51]
you bring a good result.

[00:51 - 00:54]
But you don't have the idea behind it - that why this exactly works?

[00:54 - 00:58]
And that is the major different between you & a professional prompt engineer.

[00:58 - 01:01]
Now to fill this gap, this video has appeared in front of you.

[01:01 - 01:04]
Now you've to watch this video till the end properly

[01:04 - 01:07]
because you'll get lot of help through this video.

[01:07 - 01:11]
Now before moving in the video, tell me quickly that - which AI tools are you currently using

[01:11 - 01:12]
generally in your day to day life?

[01:12 - 01:18]
Now world has changed. After the arrival AI, many things are changing very fastly.

[01:18 - 01:21]
Now you need to compete with this fast pace world.

[01:21 - 01:25]
If you don't do it, you'll be left behind. Now currently, AI is like a ocean

[01:25 - 01:28]
when, which new thing would be discovered - no one knows.

[01:28 - 01:32]
But whatever is there right now, you should atleast know how to use that and learn

[01:33 - 01:36]
everything that is possible so that whatever work you're currently doing

[01:36 - 01:40]
even more effeciently. And you can become a better software engineer.

[01:40 - 01:43]
You can become a better web developer - whatever you're working

[01:43 - 01:47]
you can be better at it by actually leveraging & using AI.

[01:47 - 01:55]
Now, using AI means by giving AI a better prompt, you should be able to make your work more efficient & better.

[01:55 - 01:59]
That's why prompt engineering is such a subject that everyone should learn.

[01:59 - 02:01]
Whether you're in first year, second year, 12th class

[02:02 - 02:05]
whether you already have 10 year experience - whatever you're doing.

[02:05 - 02:09]
You should learn prompt engineering. It is going to help you out for sure.

[02:09 - 02:12]
And you already know how important communication is & along with it,

[02:12 - 02:15]
communicating with AI is getting equally important.

[02:15 - 02:18]
And that is why prompt engineering is really important for you.

[02:18 - 02:24]
By having this skill, an average prompt engineer earns Rs 15-30 lakh.

[02:24 - 02:28]
And few advanced prompt engineers or the experienced prompt engineers

[02:28 - 02:32]
they're earning up to a crore rupees a year. now a question might be rising that

[02:32 - 02:33]
where should I start these things from?

[02:33 - 02:34]
This video is for you.

[02:34 - 02:37]
Here we'll earn basic prompt engineering.

[02:37 - 02:39]
I'll teach you whatever you require

[02:39 - 02:43]
just watch it until the end. Take out a pen & paper. And like the video first.

[02:44 - 02:44]
Let's start the video.

[02:44 - 02:51]
Now before we start getting into more details, first you need to understand the basics of Generative AI -  its capabilities.

[02:52 - 02:52]
So first let me explain that.

[02:53 - 02:54]
Now to understand this, let me give you an example.

[02:55 - 02:57]
For example, you've a friend named Shyam.

[02:57 - 03:01]
You told Shyam - Let's learn baking.

[03:02 - 03:03]
What should we learn?
We should learn baking.

[03:04 - 03:07]
Now, there can be two results in it. You didn't give him any instructions

[03:07 - 03:09]
you just told him to bake something sweet and serve.

[03:10 - 03:13]
Now, he either set fire.

[03:14 - 03:14]
Fire!

[03:15 - 03:17]
Where? He set your house on fire.

[03:18 - 03:21]
It was set on fire OR he'll bake you something.

[03:22 - 03:23]
He'll bake you cookies.

[03:24 - 03:24]
Right!

[03:24 - 03:26]
You got chocolate chip cookies.

[03:26 - 03:31]
But on the other hand, on the same evening - if you would've said

[03:31 - 03:33]
with step by step instructions.

[03:43 - 03:46]
that first pre-heat

[03:46 - 03:48]
our oven on 180 degrees.

[03:48 - 03:51]
Right! After that, take 2 cups of wheat flour.

[03:54 - 04:00]
Right! Add 3 table spoon sugar in it.

[04:01 - 04:05]
And by this, you'll tell him everything step by step - like add milk

[04:05 - 04:07]
how much milk has to be added - you've to do these things.

[04:07 - 04:11]
So finally, you would've got 100% cookies for sure.

[04:12 - 04:17]
So this is prompt engineering. Now all your LLMs - LLM means

[04:17 - 04:22]
Large Language Model - the more better step by step prompt you give them

[04:22 - 04:24]
you'll get a better result like it.

[04:25 - 04:31]
So we're going to learn how we can form our prompt, how can we provide them so that, you can get good results.

[04:31 - 04:35]
Now all the generative AI models take things literally

[04:35 - 04:37]
whatever you write them, they'll bring you the exact result of it.

[04:37 - 04:39]
They doesn't guess anything on their own.

[04:40 - 04:46]
So however vague input you give them, chances to get similar vague output increases.

[04:46 - 04:50]
But if you give them detailed instructions, then will you become prompt engineer.

[04:50 - 04:53]
No! You'll have to learn many more things.

[04:53 - 05:02]
Now for example, let's give it another prompt. Like If I say that, I want a caption

[05:02 - 05:10]
for my coding marathon that went for 2 long days.

[05:11 - 05:13]
Let's correct the spelling of caption.

[05:16 - 05:19]
And it'll give us a vague answer.

[05:20 - 05:25]
Right! - What did it give here?
'48 Hours, Endless lines: Turning Code into Dreams'

[05:25 - 05:27]
It gave us a very small answer.

[05:27 - 05:34]
It could've given us but it is very common, so it'll write anything and if we want it to write something better than this

[05:34 - 05:35]
then what do we need to do

[05:35 - 05:36]
let's understand that.

[05:36 - 05:39]
Now instead of giving them vague inputs. We need to focus on 3 things.

[05:39 - 05:41]
What are those 3 things?

[05:41 - 05:46]
First is - Persona, second is - task and finally - context.

[05:46 - 05:49]
So whenever you talk to any LLM, whenever you write any prompt

[05:49 - 05:54]
then you need to keep these 3 things in your consideration.

[05:54 - 06:00]
First, whatever model you're talking to be it Claud, Chat GPT, DeepSeek

[06:01 - 06:02]
you need to give it a Persona.

[06:02 - 06:03]
What would that persona be?

[06:04 - 06:05]
We'll discuss that further as well.

[06:05 - 06:09]
Secondly, task - that what work needs to be done and finally, context.

[06:09 - 06:13]
It has to be given context that - what is are things, what is going to happen

[06:13 - 06:16]
so let's learn this through an example.

[06:16 - 06:18]
Let's improve the previous prompt a bit.

[06:18 - 06:22]
So I've improved my prompt - 'You're a witty social media expert.

[06:22 - 06:25]
Give me an funny instagram caption about happily coding for 12 hours straight.'

[06:26 - 06:28]
Now let's see, what output does it give us.

[06:28 - 06:30]
Now its better than the previous one.

[06:30 - 06:37]
As you can read  - ' 12 hours of coding because who needs sleep when you've got coffee and endless lines of love!'

[06:37 - 06:41]
Right! So it has added some wittiness & gave you a better caption.

[06:42 - 06:45]
Now let's de-code it - Why we got this result?

[06:45 - 06:48]
Right! So this is our prompt. Let me divide it in parts.

[06:48 - 06:50]
That what things have we done, right!

[06:51 - 06:56]
This one was our Persona. 'Give me an Instagram caption' - was our task.

[06:57 - 07:00]
And finally what was our context - context was - 'about happily coding............'

[07:01 - 07:05]
And what was our context was - context was 'about happily coding straight for 12 hours.'

[07:06 - 07:13]
Right!  - 12 hours straight - but these are the three parts of the prompt & we generated it in such a way

[07:13 - 07:15]
so that we get a better output.

[07:15 - 07:19]
Now with this prompt, GPT knew that what had to be done, when, what are we writing the post for

[07:19 - 07:22]
which type of post are we writing, which emotions do we've to trigger.

[07:23 - 07:30]
And this type of prompting is called multi-step prompting - that which works on persona, task & Context.

[07:30 - 07:38]
Now you can compare generative AI with a mimicry artist. The more you teach it, the better context you give it,

[07:38 - 07:42]
you'll be getting better output. Now you can see these 3 categories as building blocks and

[07:42 - 07:48]
start being creative. You can try different prompts to learn how the results change when you actually give it

[07:49 - 07:53]
persona, task & context. And you'll learn by practicing these things repeatedly.

[07:53 - 07:59]
There is no short-short formula that you if you do this way, you'll get a wonderful output.

[07:59 - 08:03]
Along with it, according to the recent study of Japanese University that if you add

[08:03 - 08:07]
one more line - 'let's think step by step' - then it'll give you even better result.

[08:07 - 08:12]
Now for example ask it - 'what is the meaning of life?'

[08:13 - 08:14]
Then it'll give us an output.

[08:19 - 08:25]
Right! It added many things. But now if I give Chat GPT the same prompt

[08:26 - 08:35]
but with a better - just add one more line - 'Let's think step by step.'

[08:43 - 08:47]
Then the output, like the overall thinking & everything increases.

[08:47 - 08:51]
For example, it tells - Subjective purpose, Philosophical & Existential Views,

[08:52 - 08:57]
Religious & Spiritual Interpretations and finally, Scientific & Evolutionary Perspectives.

[08:57 - 09:02]
Then here it tells - Recognized Subjectivity, Examine Personal Beliefs,

[09:02 - 09:09]
Consider Philosophical Prospects, Reflect on Religion & Spirituality, Look at Scientific & Evolutionary views,

[09:09 - 09:14]
Acknowledge Cultural influences, synthesize & create your own meaning

[09:14 - 09:19]
This  step by step approach shows that rather than finding a universal answer

[09:19 - 09:23]
the meaning of life is something you construct through introspection & your

[09:23 - 09:25]
interaction with the world.

[09:25 - 09:28]
Can you see, how deeply Chat GPT has thought about it!?

[09:28 - 09:32]
Now you might be thinking that prompt engineering is very complex.

[09:32 - 09:36]
But in most of the places, simplicity is required rather than complex.

[09:36 - 09:40]
How simply can you divide it into multiple steps,

[09:40 - 09:46]
tell about it, you can explain your problem & if you're able to tell the type of result you want then

[09:46 - 09:51]
you'll get to see better final results. For starter, just focus on two things.

[09:51 - 09:54]
First is, multi-step prompting & the second one is adaptive prompting.

[09:55 - 09:59]
As you know, in multi-step you need to give 3 things. First is persona, then task, then context

[09:59 - 10:01]
as I've told you many times earlier as well.

[10:01 - 10:06]
In adaptive prompting, you need to add little more context with existing information

[10:06 - 10:12]
with the help of which, Chat GPT or any of your LLM can analyze the information in an even better way,

[10:12 - 10:16]
it'll be able to fix problems & give you good output. Now the 3 basic categories

[10:16 - 10:20]
that is like, more than enough for anyone who is starting from the beginning.

[10:20 - 10:25]
Or if you're doing day-to-day tasks then, but if you're an aspiring prompt engineer

[10:25 - 10:27]
then we need to study little more advanced things.

[10:27 - 10:31]
Now we've talked about core things - there're 3 core things in advanced prompting.

[10:31 - 10:35]
You need to add things in detail in this - I'll tell you this slowly further.

[10:35 - 10:39]
But first is persona, second is task & third is context.

[10:39 - 10:44]
I'm telling you this so many times so that it sets in your mind. Whenever you write the next prompt

[10:44 - 10:47]
then you would use these 3 pillars and write better prompts.

[10:47 - 10:52]
Now our persona is divided into further 4 more sub categories.

[10:52 - 10:55]
The 4 sub categories are, as you can see on the screen.

[10:55 - 10:57]
First is expertise level.

[10:57 - 11:01]
Then is role based persona. Third is Personality & tone.

[11:01 - 11:04]
And finally, biases & ethical constraints.

[11:04 - 11:10]
It is divided in all these things. For example, in the first one - if we talk about expertise level

[11:10 - 11:12]
that you're a beginner, you need to think like one

[11:12 - 11:16]
if you're expert or in medium level - so you need to add those things.

[11:16 - 11:19]
For example, if you're solving a software engineering problem

[11:19 - 11:23]
you can just add experience that you're 10 year experienced

[11:23 - 11:25]
so it'll think like a 10 year experienced.

[11:25 - 11:30]
Or if you're learning, you can ask Chat GPT to say that you're a beginner & think like a beginner.

[11:30 - 11:33]
And let answer questions to me. This is number one

[11:33 - 11:36]
which is your sub category of persona i.e. expertise level.

[11:36 - 11:41]
Second is - Role based persona. For example, you're a software engineer - first you told the experience

[11:41 - 11:44]
about how much time have you spent, then you told that you're software engineer.

[11:44 - 11:49]
Or you're a singer or you yourself are a prompt engineer. In this way, you can give it different persona.

[11:49 - 11:53]
depending on their role. Third is personality & tone.

[11:53 - 11:58]
Now if you don't add personality in anything, for example if you're  making it write content

[11:58 - 12:05]
then with adding personality & tone, you'll get very robotic answers. That is why personality & tone is really important.

[12:05 - 12:07]
Last but not least, its not used much.

[12:07 - 12:10]
But it was, biases & ethical constraints.

[12:11 - 12:14]
Now, for example if you're writing things around particular topic

[12:15 - 12:21]
you don't want biases in it or if there're ethical constraints about which you can't talk

[12:21 - 12:26]
then we should also give that context to chat GPT or any LLM that you're using.

[12:26 - 12:31]
Now in this case, if you're talking about a social issue then tell it that

[12:31 - 12:34]
which things you need to avoid & you'll get the answer in a more neutral way.

[12:34 - 12:39]
Now as persona has sub categories, similarly task also has sub categories.

[12:39 - 12:43]
After task, even context has sub categories.

[12:43 - 12:49]
As you can see here, what the sub categories of task would be - response type

[12:49 - 12:53]
you need summarization, explanation, creative writing, comparison.

[12:53 - 12:57]
In summarization - summarize this article into 3 bullet points. Explain in simple terms

[12:57 - 13:05]
that like 'I'm a 5 year old' or write a sci-fi short story in the style of Isaac, right!

[13:05 - 13:08]
And similarly, you can add names. Chat GPT will have idea o how to write.

[13:08 - 13:13]
Finally, compare the iPhone 15 and Samsung S24 based on features.

[13:14 - 13:17]
So you're giving it different types of persona.

[13:17 - 13:23]
Then comes, output formatting, depth & length control and creativity vs precision.

[13:23 - 13:27]
In output formatting, you can tell the format in which you want the output.

[13:28 - 13:33]
Now for example - give me a JSON format, write in bulleted list format,

[13:33 - 13:39]
or generate a table with the difference between Python & Java.

[13:39 - 13:43]
So you can ask the type of output you want. Then comes, depth & length of control.

[13:43 - 13:47]
If you want answer in one sentence, detailed or tweet sized

[13:47 - 13:49]
you can give context of which type of answer you want.

[13:49 - 13:53]
And finally, creativity vas precision.

[13:53 - 13:58]
You can adjust to how rigid & creative you want. Be highly factual or be creative, add some metaphor

[13:58 - 14:00]
or add your understanding.

[14:00 - 14:06]
Right! Similarly next comes, context sub categories. It includes, domain specific, prior information,

[14:06 - 14:10]
target audience, cultural & regional adaption, style & mood context.

[14:11 - 14:14]
Define the industry or the field the AI should focus on.

[14:14 - 14:17]
Carry over precious instructions or context.

[14:17 - 14:24]
As you can see, you can read everything here. In domain context, you can tell - Explain AI in the context

[14:24 - 14:27]
of healthcare - if you're healthcare professional, so tell according to that.

[14:27 - 14:33]
Generate a marketing strategy for an e-commerce startup. Talk about cybersecurity risks in cloud computing.

[14:33 - 14:39]
So you gave it more context that here, we're only talking about cloud computing, related to cybersecurity.

[14:39 - 14:45]
For example, we talked about marketing. Only around e-commerce startup.

[14:45 - 14:50]
Similarly, you'll see prior information has been provided - using the last example you gave me

[14:50 - 14:54]
now apply it in finance or remember the company I mentioned earlier

[14:54 - 14:57]
whatever context you gave earlier, whatever you talked about before

[14:57 - 14:59]
you're resurfacing it again.

[14:59 - 15:02]
Then comes - explain the topic for 8th grade students.

[15:03 - 15:08]
Final - what is your target audience. Your output changes a lot according to it.

[15:08 - 15:12]
As lot of people say that, explain this to me like a 10 year old.

[15:12 - 15:17]
So that simple words are used more, simple examples are used more, right!

[15:17 - 15:23]
So similarly you can do that with AI. Then comes, cultural & regional adaptation - ensure AI localizes

[15:23 - 15:27]
responses for different audience. Explain in Hinglish with Indian cultural references.

[15:27 - 15:31]
It'll tell you in Hinglish, you'll get the output. Use relevant to European startups

[15:31 - 15:32]
like etc. etc.

[15:32 - 15:37]
Similarly, in style & mood context - fine-tune writing styles or emotional tone.

[15:37 - 15:40]
Make it sound like a TEDX talk speech.

[15:40 - 15:44]
If you're having an article written or answer - you can have it in TEDX format.

[15:44 - 15:49]
And something similar, you can give the context - write in an emotional and inspiring way

[15:49 - 15:51]
keep it neutral or purely analytical.

[15:51 - 15:54]
So these are some of the examples of context.

[15:54 - 16:00]
Still, our prompt is formed by these 3 things. First we'll give it persona, then task and finally, context.

[16:00 - 16:04]
Context can be of different ways, task can be of different ways & as well as persona

[16:04 - 16:06]
can also be of different ways.

[16:06 - 16:12]
Now you won't be able to learn all these in one day. You'll take time to implement, adapt these things.

[16:12 - 16:18]
Which sub category of context should be used & where, which sub category of task should be used & where

[16:18 - 16:21]
but the more you use, the more you prompt, the better you get

[16:21 - 16:25]
now since we pushing the boundaries so much, then let's talk about 3 such techniques

[16:25 - 16:27]
which are actually used in prompt engineering.

[16:27 - 16:32]
Now, you'll get thousands of it but we'll just talk about three which are actually used in the industry a lot

[16:32 - 16:35]
and generally, if you're doing something yourself, then you would be mostly using these.

[16:35 - 16:37]
Now first comes, Chain of thoughts prompting.

[16:38 - 16:44]
For example, let's say - What is 487 x 27?

[16:44 - 16:45]
Right!

[16:45 - 16:50]
I gave my prompt. So it just gave the answer - 487 x 27 = 13149.

[16:50 - 16:54]
Prompt was very basic but Gemini gave us the answer.

[16:54 - 16:57]
Now First tell me, is it correct or wrong?

[16:57 - 17:02]
If you're answer is - It is Correct, then No - here we won't know that how would be verify this answer.

[17:02 - 17:05]
So it verify, we use Chain of Thoughts.

[17:05 - 17:10]
Now here the question was very straight forward but for example, if you're coding & you're facing a problem

[17:10 - 17:12]
you want to know what was the chain of thoughts in it.

[17:12 - 17:18]
And how did it came to that conclusion - there you can use the prompting of chain of thoughts.

[17:18 - 17:23]
So instead of asking what is - 487 x 27 - you can just say

[17:23 - 17:32]
think step by step, first break down 487x 27

[17:32 - 17:33]
into two smaller multiplications

[17:33 - 17:37]
now using chain of thoughts - as you can see, it has broken it down.

[17:37 - 17:40]
27 - we can think of 27 as ( 20+7)

[17:40 - 17:43]
So 487 x 20 and 487 x 7

[17:43 - 17:47]
so it showed us the calculation and finally our answer is the one which it gave earlier.

[17:47 - 17:54]
Now in this way, like you can verify the problem you're solving, if its solution is correct or not.

[17:54 - 18:00]
Now you can verify for easy problems but this is going to help you out in complex problems for sure.

[18:00 - 18:04]
Now the second technique is - few shot prompting. Now, as I told you in the starting of the video

[18:04 - 18:06]
that - you've to write a witty caption

[18:06 - 18:10]
but you work in a company where your work is to write only captions but

[18:10 - 18:17]
the company has proper tones, the way they talk or there're words or things which they use.

[18:17 - 18:19]
What you can do is, you can create a brand brief here.

[18:20 - 18:25]
Now, you can create brand brief taking old examples in context. Through this brand brief

[18:25 - 18:29]
and you can actually prompt & get your results in a better manner

[18:29 - 18:35]
you'll get a very good result. And similarly, where else can you use few shot prompting

[18:35 - 18:41]
for example, you understand a coding creator's videos very well. You gave it to Gemini - it transcribed that

[18:41 - 18:45]
after transcribing 2-3 videos, you can train your own persona.

[18:45 - 18:50]
Similarly, you can ask the tone in which he talks, what are the examples.

[18:50 - 18:58]
And then you can ask Chat GPT or Gemini, to explain you any other concept in a similar manner.

[18:58 - 19:02]
So you'll be able to understand it very well. Let's come to the last technique, which is a bit complex but

[19:02 - 19:06]
listen to it properly. It is called as - Top-p sampling or Nucleus Sampling.

[19:06 - 19:10]
Now it is like a volume button. According to it, you can control things

[19:10 - 19:13]
the first thing is accuracy & second thing is randomness.

[19:13 - 19:17]
Let's understand it with an example, you visited an ice cream shop, there're lot of flavours but

[19:17 - 19:24]
you want the best flavour. For that, you'll have multiple options

[19:24 - 19:28]
among which you'll be choosing. Similarly, when you type anything on web browser

[19:28 - 19:31]
for example, let me type and show you.

[19:31 - 19:34]
The sky is -

[19:34 - 19:39]
so here after - The sky is - you get multiple options. Here we've - pink, full up movies,

[19:39 - 19:42]
everywhere - so its recommending movies, right!

[19:42 - 19:48]
So there can be many similar examples here. But the unlikely examples that can be - grand, majestic

[19:48 - 19:52]
and pink - these are very unlikely but in this case, there're lot of other examples

[19:52 - 19:55]
which could've popped up for example, blue, cloudy and clear.

[19:55 - 19:59]
Now this is because - AI generally picks some probable words but if you want to

[19:59 - 20:01]
make the AI more precise, then what should you do.

[20:01 - 20:07]
For that, you need to reduce P level. Where lowest P level ranges from 0.2-0.3

[20:07 - 20:10]
this is very good for research paper, medical field or coding.

[20:10 - 20:14]
It provides you reliable and accurate information.

[20:14 - 20:18]
For Day to day general task, 0.4-0.7 is very good.

[20:18 - 20:25]
Now after this, if you want to do creative tasks then range of 0.85-0.95 is very good P level.

[20:25 - 20:31]
And finally, highest one - 0.96 - 1 is going to give you a random output, if you use it.

[20:31 - 20:37]
And usually, nobody keeps such high value due to this reason. Unlike any other normal prompt, you cannot

[20:37 - 20:44]
directly add P value anywhere. To add P value, you'll actually need to use APIs. Now for that, you need to go

[20:44 - 20:48]
to the Open AI playground & on Gemini's playground you can use these things.

[20:48 - 20:52]
Actually by using API, you can build some more things.

[20:52 - 20:54]
If you want to learn that as well, then definitely tell in the comment section.

[20:54 - 20:59]
We can actually make a video on fine-tuning and multiple other things that you can

[20:59 - 21:02]
use or do while using prompt engineering properly.

[21:02 - 21:08]
Now there're lot of advanced techniques, generally, in day-to-day life or in general you don't use it much.

[21:08 - 21:11]
But if you're interested, then do let me know. Now as I told you in the starting of the video.

[21:11 - 21:16]
There're endless possibilities. You can learn many things and even do it.

[21:16 - 21:21]
Bro, think about prompt engineering, add it in your daily habit.
