[00:00 - 00:05]
how does AI actually see your prompts

[00:03 - 00:08]
here's where most people get it wrong

[00:05 - 00:10]
when you say write about a cat sitting

[00:08 - 00:12]
on a couch your human brain knows what a

[00:10 - 00:16]
cat is what a couch is and you picture

[00:12 - 00:18]
it in your mind but Ai No AI does not

[00:16 - 00:21]
see words or images like we do it's all

[00:18 - 00:22]
math literally every word you type gets

[00:21 - 00:25]
turned into number kind of like a

[00:22 - 00:27]
barcode and the AI doesn't just look at

[00:25 - 00:29]
the words one by one it looks at the

[00:27 - 00:31]
patterns figures out how the numbers

[00:29 - 00:34]
connect like hat plus sitting plus couch

[00:31 - 00:35]
equals something specific that's how it

[00:34 - 00:38]
understands the context large language

[00:35 - 00:40]
models like Chad gbt are trained in

[00:38 - 00:43]
mountains of data books websites code

[00:40 - 00:45]
you name it so they've seen billions of

[00:43 - 00:47]
patterns and when you give it a prompt

[00:45 - 00:50]
it's like playing a giant guessing game

[00:47 - 00:52]
What's the most likely response based on

[00:50 - 00:54]
the patterns it knows for image

[00:52 - 00:56]
generators it's pretty similar except

[00:54 - 00:59]
instead of predicting the words next

[00:56 - 01:01]
word they predict pixels you say a cat

[00:59 - 01:03]
setting on a couch in a sunny living

[01:01 - 01:05]
room and they think hm based on

[01:03 - 01:07]
everything I've learned what colors

[01:05 - 01:09]
shapes and textures fit this description

[01:07 - 01:12]
and Boom Out pops an image they're not

[01:09 - 01:15]
actually seeing or thinking they're just

[01:12 - 01:17]
ridiculously good at matching patterns

[01:15 - 01:19]
the takeaway here is that if you want

[01:17 - 01:21]
great results you can talk to AI like

[01:19 - 01:23]
it's your buddy you have to speak its

[01:21 - 01:27]
language give it the right patterns to

[01:23 - 01:29]
work with let's talk prompt engineering

[01:27 - 01:31]
yeah that's the fancy term for what

[01:29 - 01:33]
we're doing in here if you're the kind

[01:31 - 01:35]
of person who loves to go all in there

[01:33 - 01:37]
are plenty of free and paid courses you

[01:35 - 01:41]
can check out but let's be real for most

[01:37 - 01:43]
people this one video will cover 99%

[01:41 - 01:46]
what you need to know no overthinking

[01:43 - 01:49]
required now focusing on LMS like Chad

[01:46 - 01:51]
gbt gemini or Claude these models are

[01:49 - 01:53]
great at understanding natural language

[01:51 - 01:56]
though some are better than others with

[01:53 - 01:58]
these prompting it's less about giving

[01:56 - 02:00]
the perfect structure and more about

[01:58 - 02:02]
giving enough structure think of it like

[02:00 - 02:04]
talking to someone who can follow

[02:02 - 02:07]
directions as long as they are clear so

[02:04 - 02:10]
your job is to be as descriptive and

[02:07 - 02:12]
precise as possible that said some LMS

[02:10 - 02:14]
are a little more particular about how

[02:12 - 02:16]
they're prompted while they still

[02:14 - 02:18]
understand natural language they may

[02:16 - 02:20]
need your prompt to hit a few key points

[02:18 - 02:22]
but don't worry the guidelines I'm about

[02:20 - 02:25]
to share work across the board whether

[02:22 - 02:27]
the AI is forgiving or picky rule number

[02:25 - 02:30]
one ditch the fluff forget all the

[02:27 - 02:33]
pleasantries like can you please what do

[02:30 - 02:34]
you think or maybe you could AI does not

[02:33 - 02:37]
care about your matters it has no

[02:34 - 02:39]
feelings no ego and definitely no plans

[02:37 - 02:41]
to Rise Up Against Humanity because you

[02:39 - 02:43]
didn't say please keep it direct and

[02:41 - 02:45]
factual for example instead of can you

[02:43 - 02:47]
please write me a short story about a

[02:45 - 02:49]
robot and a dog who can go adventure

[02:47 - 02:51]
together just say write a short story

[02:49 - 02:53]
about a robot and a dog going on an

[02:51 - 02:55]
adventure see the difference you're

[02:53 - 02:57]
couldn't out an necessary words this not

[02:55 - 02:59]
only saves time but also avoids giving

[02:57 - 03:01]
the AI extra tokens basically pieces of

[02:59 - 03:03]
of text to process the fewer

[03:01 - 03:05]
distractions you give it the better the

[03:03 - 03:07]
results Simple and Clean that's the way

[03:05 - 03:09]
to go if you've ever tried promoting

[03:07 - 03:11]
your business through social media you

[03:09 - 03:13]
know how difficult it is to come up with

[03:11 - 03:16]
posts and videos write everything should

[03:13 - 03:17]
edit post that's a lot to handle a good

[03:16 - 03:20]
solution would be to use predus the

[03:17 - 03:22]
sponsor of today's video and an amazing

[03:20 - 03:24]
toll that simplifies the creation of

[03:22 - 03:27]
branded social media content posts ad

[03:24 - 03:29]
videos carousels and much more it's so

[03:27 - 03:31]
easy here if I want to Carousel I pick

[03:29 - 03:34]
it from the type the general idea of the

[03:31 - 03:37]
post specify a few things like the theme

[03:34 - 03:39]
assets used and so on the AI here is

[03:37 - 03:41]
really good so if you don't want stock

[03:39 - 03:44]
images it will generate them for you the

[03:41 - 03:46]
same goes for ad videos a rough idea is

[03:44 - 03:48]
enough and the AI will figure it out and

[03:46 - 03:50]
the quality of the generate post and

[03:48 - 03:52]
videos is actually good everything can

[03:50 - 03:54]
be used Straight Out of the platform

[03:52 - 03:57]
predus also makes post and easier thanks

[03:54 - 03:59]
to post scheduling I can pick when I

[03:57 - 04:01]
want the post or video to go live build

[03:59 - 04:04]
a hul plan and it will be posted without

[04:01 - 04:06]
my involvement and fedus integrates well

[04:04 - 04:09]
not only with social media but also with

[04:06 - 04:11]
e-commerce platforms like Shopify woomer

[04:09 - 04:13]
Wix integration takes only a couple

[04:11 - 04:15]
clicks and you're ready to streamline

[04:13 - 04:17]
the pipeline fredes can even

[04:15 - 04:20]
automatically transform listings into

[04:17 - 04:22]
posts ad videos and carousels and that

[04:20 - 04:24]
scheduled posting really comes in handy

[04:22 - 04:27]
here on top of all this there's also a

[04:24 - 04:30]
built-in competitor analysis toll which

[04:27 - 04:32]
shows core features Target audiences

[04:30 - 04:34]
pricing user experience and Innovations

[04:32 - 04:36]
of your competitors predice is a

[04:34 - 04:38]
One-Stop solution for the social media

[04:36 - 04:40]
needs of any business really be sure to

[04:38 - 04:41]
check it out the link is in the

[04:40 - 04:43]
description here's the golden rule of

[04:41 - 04:45]
promp writing be descriptive this is

[04:43 - 04:46]
where you level up your results sure

[04:45 - 04:48]
couldn't out of necessary words is

[04:46 - 04:50]
important but now we're flipping the

[04:48 - 04:52]
script we're adding the right words

[04:50 - 04:54]
because the more detail you give the

[04:52 - 04:55]
less the AI has to guess and trust me

[04:54 - 04:58]
the guessing game is where results go

[04:55 - 05:00]
sideways let's break it down AI thrives

[04:58 - 05:02]
un clearance instructions so you've got

[05:00 - 05:04]
to eliminate any room for

[05:02 - 05:06]
misunderstanding give it details about

[05:04 - 05:09]
the topic the tone and the audience for

[05:06 - 05:12]
example asking for a blog post about the

[05:09 - 05:14]
economics of the Middle East in 1960s is

[05:12 - 05:16]
setting yourself up for a bland generic

[05:14 - 05:18]
response AI doesn't know how much detail

[05:16 - 05:20]
you want what tone to use or who's

[05:18 - 05:24]
supposed to read this instead say

[05:20 - 05:25]
something like this write a 1,000w blog

[05:24 - 05:29]
post about the economic situation of

[05:25 - 05:32]
kuay from 1961 to 1967 aimed at

[05:29 - 05:34]
beginners in a conversational tone now

[05:32 - 05:37]
you've T the AI exactly what you want

[05:34 - 05:39]
word count time frame tone and audience

[05:37 - 05:42]
the result much more thorough and

[05:39 - 05:44]
engaging response with fewer follow-up

[05:42 - 05:46]
tweaks think of it as frontloading the

[05:44 - 05:48]
works so you don't have to keep refining

[05:46 - 05:50]
after the fact now you can prompt almost

[05:48 - 05:52]
any AI out there and if you're curious

[05:50 - 05:56]
about which AIS you should check out

[05:52 - 05:59]
visit our website aim. me there we post

[05:56 - 06:01]
reviews of handpicked AI TOs and educate

[05:59 - 06:03]
people on the basics of AI the link is

[06:01 - 06:05]
in the description now context and

[06:03 - 06:08]
specifics there are like two sides of

[06:05 - 06:10]
the same coin specifics tell the AI what

[06:08 - 06:13]
to write about while context guides how

[06:10 - 06:15]
it should write it say you ask AI to

[06:13 - 06:17]
write a blog post about social media

[06:15 - 06:19]
marketing you are leaving AI to figure

[06:17 - 06:21]
out everything who's the audience what's

[06:19 - 06:24]
the tone how much detail to include the

[06:21 - 06:26]
result generic surface level fluff but

[06:24 - 06:28]
watch what happens when you tweak it

[06:26 - 06:30]
write a 1,000-word blog post about

[06:28 - 06:33]
digital social media marketing for

[06:30 - 06:35]
beginners using conversational tone

[06:33 - 06:38]
targeting General audience and dividing

[06:35 - 06:40]
it into five parts each with a short

[06:38 - 06:42]
list you specify the audience beginners

[06:40 - 06:44]
the tone conversational and even the

[06:42 - 06:46]
structure five parts with lists this not

[06:44 - 06:49]
only saves time but also ensures the

[06:46 - 06:52]
response fits your exact needs no vague

[06:49 - 06:54]
answers no extra guesswork specificity

[06:52 - 06:56]
and context are your best friends the

[06:54 - 06:58]
more you can pack into a prompt without

[06:56 - 07:01]
overloading it the better the ai's

[06:58 - 07:03]
output and later will tackle how this

[07:01 - 07:04]
approach shifts when you move to image

[07:03 - 07:07]
generators it's a whole different game

[07:04 - 07:10]
but the same principles

[07:07 - 07:13]
apply and to just make your prompts even

[07:10 - 07:16]
so slightly better remember about Ro

[07:13 - 07:18]
play when you ask an LM to act like a

[07:16 - 07:21]
specific professional you are given it a

[07:18 - 07:23]
filter instead of pulling info from all

[07:21 - 07:25]
the data it's trained on it focuses on a

[07:23 - 07:27]
specific field that makes the response

[07:25 - 07:29]
more accurate more factual and relevant

[07:27 - 07:32]
to the topic when it to write like a

[07:29 - 07:34]
journalist lawyer or doctor just tell it

[07:32 - 07:37]
instead of saying explain the legal

[07:34 - 07:39]
process for panting invention try this

[07:37 - 07:41]
you are a patent lawyer explain the

[07:39 - 07:44]
legal process for penting and invention

[07:41 - 07:47]
in simple terms for a non-legal audience

[07:44 - 07:49]
with the raw assign the AI knows to stay

[07:47 - 07:51]
within the boundaries of that profession

[07:49 - 07:53]
and speak in a way that aligns with its

[07:51 - 07:56]
expertise the response will feel sharper

[07:53 - 07:58]
more polished and far less generic so

[07:56 - 08:00]
remember always give the AI had to wear

[07:58 - 08:05]
a role to play it's like switching the

[08:00 - 08:05]
AI into a mode that's tailored to your

[08:05 - 08:11]
needs another rule to remember is to use

[08:08 - 08:13]
limitations LMS like I said have no

[08:11 - 08:16]
understanding where to stop and what not

[08:13 - 08:18]
to do they might overe explain dive into

[08:16 - 08:20]
irrelevant details or write way more

[08:18 - 08:22]
than you need that's where limitations

[08:20 - 08:25]
come in instead of saying write about

[08:22 - 08:28]
renewable energy which is way too vague

[08:25 - 08:30]
by the way say this write 200w summary

[08:28 - 08:32]
on the benefits of soul energy avoiding

[08:30 - 08:34]
technical jargon and focusing on

[08:32 - 08:36]
environmental advantages see the

[08:34 - 08:39]
difference you've kept the word count

[08:36 - 08:41]
narrowed the focus to solar energy ban

[08:39 - 08:43]
technical language and highlighted the

[08:41 - 08:45]
environmental angle this keeps the

[08:43 - 08:48]
response tight relevant and manageable

[08:45 - 08:51]
here's a pro tip use words like avoid

[08:48 - 08:53]
only or focus on to set clear boundaries

[08:51 - 08:55]
for example write a three paragraph

[08:53 - 08:58]
article summarizing the pros and cons

[08:55 - 09:00]
wind energy for high school students

[08:58 - 09:03]
avoid discussing Financial incentives

[09:00 - 09:05]
and focus only on environmental benefits

[09:03 - 09:06]
these little tweaks make a huge

[09:05 - 09:09]
difference you're telling the AI not

[09:06 - 09:12]
just what to write but how to write it

[09:09 - 09:14]
and what to leave

[09:12 - 09:16]
out but even if after all this the

[09:14 - 09:19]
results are not perfect you can always

[09:16 - 09:21]
do some iterative prompting instead of

[09:19 - 09:23]
trying to nail the perfect prompt on

[09:21 - 09:26]
your first go you start simple and build

[09:23 - 09:28]
from there think of it like a layer in a

[09:26 - 09:30]
cake each prompt adds a new layer of

[09:28 - 09:32]
clarity and precision until you've got

[09:30 - 09:34]
exactly what you need for example say

[09:32 - 09:37]
you start with a broad prompt like a

[09:34 - 09:38]
explain renewable energy the response

[09:37 - 09:41]
will probably be vague and all over the

[09:38 - 09:43]
place so you're fining focus on the

[09:41 - 09:45]
advantages of wind energy compared to

[09:43 - 09:48]
fossil fuels and now you're getting

[09:45 - 09:50]
closer but maybe it's still not quite

[09:48 - 09:52]
what you're looking for so you add

[09:50 - 09:54]
another layer rewrite the explanation

[09:52 - 09:56]
for a 10-year-old audience using simple

[09:54 - 09:58]
language and examples and now the

[09:56 - 10:00]
results hit the mark could you have

[09:58 - 10:03]
written one detailed prom up front sure

[10:00 - 10:05]
something like explain renewable energy

[10:03 - 10:07]
focusing on the advantages of wind

[10:05 - 10:08]
energy compared to fossil fuels for

[10:07 - 10:11]
10-year-old audience using simple

[10:08 - 10:13]
language and examples that might work

[10:11 - 10:15]
for simple tasks but as your requests

[10:13 - 10:17]
get more complex iterative prompting

[10:15 - 10:19]
shines lets you just refine add detail

[10:17 - 10:22]
step by step without overwhelming

[10:19 - 10:22]
yourself or the

[10:22 - 10:27]
AI a part of that being specific from

[10:25 - 10:30]
earlier was given the LM information

[10:27 - 10:32]
about style tone of voice formatting

[10:30 - 10:34]
that sort of thing I'll admit these

[10:32 - 10:36]
little things don't have a huge impact

[10:34 - 10:39]
on General prompting but if you need

[10:36 - 10:41]
specific format in style or a specific

[10:39 - 10:43]
tone of voice you should incorporate

[10:41 - 10:46]
these things into your promps this can

[10:43 - 10:48]
include formats like lists tables essays

[10:46 - 10:51]
or specific writing styles like poems

[10:48 - 10:53]
song verses and so on take this vague

[10:51 - 10:55]
prompt tell me about the history of

[10:53 - 10:58]
computers it's fine but you're leaving a

[10:55 - 11:00]
lot up to chance instead try write a

[10:58 - 11:03]
timeline line of major events in

[11:00 - 11:05]
computer history formatted as a bullet

[11:03 - 11:07]
list include five to seven key

[11:05 - 11:10]
Milestones with one sentence explaining

[11:07 - 11:13]
each now ai knows exactly what you want

[11:10 - 11:15]
a timeline specific number of events and

[11:13 - 11:18]
concise explanations or if you're going

[11:15 - 11:20]
for something creative like a write a

[11:18 - 11:22]
Shakespearean Sonet about space

[11:20 - 11:25]
exploration the key is to name the

[11:22 - 11:29]
format or style explicitly whether it's

[11:25 - 11:32]
essays lists tables poems or song lyrics

[11:29 - 11:33]
spelling it out ensures response matches

[11:32 - 11:35]
your

[11:33 - 11:37]
[Music]

[11:35 - 11:39]
expectations but sometimes just telling

[11:37 - 11:41]
the AI what you want isn't enough

[11:39 - 11:43]
instead you show it by providing one or

[11:41 - 11:46]
few examples of what you're looking for

[11:43 - 11:48]
you give the AI a template to work for

[11:46 - 11:51]
this approach is especially powerful for

[11:48 - 11:53]
projects for NES tasks or creative

[11:51 - 11:55]
projects where context or style matters

[11:53 - 11:57]
a lot for instance say you want a core

[11:55 - 12:00]
progression in the style of the Beach

[11:57 - 12:02]
Boys a basic prompt might be right a qut

[12:00 - 12:03]
progression the style of the Beach Boys

[12:02 - 12:06]
you might get something decent but if

[12:03 - 12:08]
you add an example the results are Next

[12:06 - 12:10]
Level try this write a chord progression

[12:08 - 12:13]
the style of the Beach Boys here's an

[12:10 - 12:15]
example with the example the AI knows

[12:13 - 12:18]
the vibe you're aiming for it's like

[12:15 - 12:20]
handing it a starting point to riff off

[12:18 - 12:22]
of ensuring the results are way closer

[12:20 - 12:25]
to what you want fuse shot prompting

[12:22 - 12:27]
isn't just for music you can apply to

[12:25 - 12:30]
wri in Styles journalistic academic

[12:27 - 12:32]
humorous formatting tables outlines

[12:30 - 12:35]
scripts specific tones or perspectives

[12:32 - 12:38]
for example write a dialogue between two

[12:35 - 12:38]
people debate in AI

[12:38 - 12:42]
ethics at this point we already can

[12:40 - 12:44]
write a perfect prom that will give us

[12:42 - 12:46]
exactly the results we want however

[12:44 - 12:48]
there is still are a few useful

[12:46 - 12:50]
techniques to keep in mind like the

[12:48 - 12:52]
Chain of Thought thing this technique is

[12:50 - 12:55]
all about structuring your prompts like

[12:52 - 12:57]
a checklist or guideline works wonders

[12:55 - 13:00]
for more complex or multi-part requests

[12:57 - 13:02]
helping the AI than through the task

[13:00 - 13:04]
logically and stay on track take this

[13:02 - 13:06]
vague prompt explain the pros and cons

[13:04 - 13:08]
off renewable energy sure it will give

[13:06 - 13:11]
you something but it might miss key

[13:08 - 13:14]
points or wonder off topic Instead try

[13:11 - 13:16]
this explain the pros and cons off

[13:14 - 13:18]
renewable energy by addressing the

[13:16 - 13:20]
following environmental impact economic

[13:18 - 13:23]
considerations avilability and

[13:20 - 13:25]
scalability long-term sustainability now

[13:23 - 13:27]
you've mapped out exactly what needs to

[13:25 - 13:29]
be covered the AI follows your structure

[13:27 - 13:33]
hitting every key point with without

[13:29 - 13:35]
throwing in irrelevant

[13:33 - 13:37]
fluff when you're dealing with big

[13:35 - 13:40]
problems and huge tasks one of the

[13:37 - 13:42]
smartest moves is to split them into

[13:40 - 13:44]
smaller chunks not only does this make

[13:42 - 13:46]
things more manageable but it also

[13:44 - 13:49]
dramatically reduces errors or

[13:46 - 13:51]
hallucinations when the AI starts making

[13:49 - 13:53]
stuff up complex tasks have a higher

[13:51 - 13:55]
chance of going off the rails so

[13:53 - 13:57]
breaking them down keeps everything on

[13:55 - 13:59]
track let's look at this overloaded

[13:57 - 14:02]
prompt explaining the causes effects and

[13:59 - 14:04]
potential solutions for climate change

[14:02 - 14:06]
that's asking a lot in one go the AI

[14:04 - 14:09]
might give a decent answer but chances

[14:06 - 14:10]
are it will miss key points or blend

[14:09 - 14:14]
everything together in a messy way

[14:10 - 14:16]
instead break it into smaller prompts

[14:14 - 14:19]
like this list the top three causes of

[14:16 - 14:21]
climate change describe the main effects

[14:19 - 14:23]
of climate change on agriculture suggest

[14:21 - 14:26]
two practical solutions to combat

[14:23 - 14:29]
climate change now instead of one overly

[14:26 - 14:32]
ambitious request you've got three clear

[14:29 - 14:33]
focused tasks AI will nail each one

[14:32 - 14:36]
individually and you can piece them

[14:33 - 14:38]
together for a polished final result and

[14:36 - 14:41]
like before this works great for simple

[14:38 - 14:43]
tasks but shines even more for complex

[14:41 - 14:45]
ones the bigger your request the more

[14:43 - 14:48]
split and

[14:45 - 14:50]
helps and just in case you're still not

[14:48 - 14:52]
satisfied after all that you can always

[14:50 - 14:55]
ask for chosen LM to help you with

[14:52 - 14:57]
prompting AI is great at breaking down

[14:55 - 14:59]
and rephrasing tasks it's literally

[14:57 - 15:02]
Built For This paste your prompt and say

[14:59 - 15:04]
refine this promt to make it clearer and

[15:02 - 15:06]
more effective explain the causes

[15:04 - 15:07]
effects and potential solutions for

[15:06 - 15:10]
climate change it might suggest

[15:07 - 15:13]
splitting up or adding more specifics

[15:10 - 15:15]
like tone audience or formatting as a

[15:13 - 15:17]
result not only do you get a better

[15:15 - 15:20]
structured prompt you're also learning

[15:17 - 15:21]
how to improve your own prompt and

[15:20 - 15:23]
skills all right let's get real nerdy

[15:21 - 15:25]
for a sec if you're into prompt

[15:23 - 15:28]
engineering there are these things

[15:25 - 15:30]
called parameters basically numbers you

[15:28 - 15:32]
can tweak to control how an AI responds

[15:30 - 15:35]
take temperature for example it's like

[15:32 - 15:37]
the randomness dial Crank It Up and you

[15:35 - 15:39]
will get super creative chaotic

[15:37 - 15:41]
responses turn it down and you will get

[15:39 - 15:44]
the AI equivalent of a straight A

[15:41 - 15:46]
student sticking to the roles but every

[15:44 - 15:48]
language model handles these parameters

[15:46 - 15:50]
a little differently in CAD gbt Claud or

[15:48 - 15:54]
Gemini you just type temperature

[15:50 - 15:56]
followed by a number like 7 or 1.0 easy

[15:54 - 15:59]
right but switch to mistal and suddenly

[15:56 - 16:01]
you're using equal sign instead of a

[15:59 - 16:03]
why who knows it's just their thing and

[16:01 - 16:05]
that's not all you've got Max tokens

[16:03 - 16:08]
which controls how long the AI will

[16:05 - 16:11]
Ramble On Top P for Creative diversity

[16:08 - 16:13]
and top K which is like saying pick the

[16:11 - 16:15]
best words but not too many options

[16:13 - 16:18]
messing with these lets you f tune your

[16:15 - 16:21]
output like a

[16:18 - 16:23]
pro now if we're talking images the game

[16:21 - 16:26]
changes some principles carry over good

[16:23 - 16:28]
prompts equals good results but the toes

[16:26 - 16:30]
get picky for example Dolly it's your

[16:28 - 16:31]
chill buy you can feed it a

[16:30 - 16:34]
straightforward description and boom

[16:31 - 16:36]
magic but something like M Journey you

[16:34 - 16:38]
better know the exact phrasing like

[16:36 - 16:40]
you're talking to an art snob who only

[16:38 - 16:42]
responds to just the right tone on the

[16:40 - 16:44]
surface it works kind of like language

[16:42 - 16:46]
models but under the hood somewhat

[16:44 - 16:49]
different Beast say you type something

[16:46 - 16:51]
like a futuristic city at Sunset and the

[16:49 - 16:53]
toll goes all right I know what you're

[16:51 - 16:56]
saying and starts froml in that prompt

[16:53 - 16:59]
into visuals here's how your words get

[16:56 - 17:02]
split into chunks like futuristic city

[16:59 - 17:04]
and sunset the AI has a number language

[17:02 - 17:06]
where it knows how these ideas connect

[17:04 - 17:07]
it's not just making the wild guesses

[17:06 - 17:10]
though it's working off a massive

[17:07 - 17:12]
database trained in billions of images

[17:10 - 17:14]
with imch descriptions think of it like

[17:12 - 17:16]
showing an artist zillion pictures and

[17:14 - 17:19]
saying this is what futuristic could

[17:16 - 17:21]
mean or this is what a city looks like

[17:19 - 17:24]
and here's the cool part it doesn't copy

[17:21 - 17:27]
instead it mashes together Styles Vibes

[17:24 - 17:29]
and Concepts it learned to cook up

[17:27 - 17:31]
something entirely fresh so how does it

[17:29 - 17:34]
actually make the image it starts with a

[17:31 - 17:37]
random noise like the static on an old

[17:34 - 17:39]
TV and gradually tweaks that mess until

[17:37 - 17:41]
it matches your description this magic

[17:39 - 17:44]
process is called diffusion the AI

[17:41 - 17:47]
refines the noise bid by bid turning

[17:44 - 17:50]
chaos into something

[17:47 - 17:52]
awesome now when you're prompting for

[17:50 - 17:54]
image generation the roles are a little

[17:52 - 17:55]
different from text models you're not

[17:54 - 17:57]
saying how to draw you're just

[17:55 - 18:00]
describing exactly what you want to see

[17:57 - 18:02]
when it comes to crafting killer image

[18:00 - 18:04]
promts the secret sausage structure you

[18:02 - 18:07]
want clear detailed instructions that

[18:04 - 18:08]
give the AI everything it needs to blow

[18:07 - 18:11]
your mind with the results here is a

[18:08 - 18:15]
super simple three-step framework to

[18:11 - 18:17]
follow one subject two description three

[18:15 - 18:19]
style aesthetic put it all together and

[18:17 - 18:21]
here's what a solid prompt looks like

[18:19 - 18:24]
the Batmobile stuck in Los Angeles

[18:21 - 18:27]
traffic impressionist painting wide shot

[18:24 - 18:29]
and boom clear subject Vivid description

[18:27 - 18:31]
and an aesthetic that paints perfect

[18:29 - 18:32]
picture using this basic framework

[18:31 - 18:34]
you'll not only get better results but

[18:32 - 18:36]
also set yourself up for Advanced

[18:34 - 18:39]
Techniques later and trust me once you

[18:36 - 18:41]
start tweaking these elements you will

[18:39 - 18:44]
unlock Next Level creativity and just in

[18:41 - 18:46]
case for more Co AI toast visit AI

[18:44 - 18:49]

[18:46 - 18:50]
reviews of the coolest AI tools out

[18:49 - 18:53]
[Music]

[18:50 - 18:56]
there your subject is the foundation

[18:53 - 18:58]
think of it as the main character of

[18:56 - 19:01]
your visual story it's usually a noun

[18:58 - 19:04]
dog spaceship guitar waterfall if you're

[19:01 - 19:06]
vague like saying Joy or Freedom the AI

[19:04 - 19:09]
is just going to shrug and throw

[19:06 - 19:11]
something random at you stick with solid

[19:09 - 19:13]
tangible things want better results

[19:11 - 19:16]
spice it up with objectives don't just

[19:13 - 19:18]
say CAD say a fluffy black cat with

[19:16 - 19:21]
glowing green eyes already more Vivid

[19:18 - 19:23]
right next up build the description add

[19:21 - 19:25]
the context what's your subject doing

[19:23 - 19:28]
how are they doing it what's happening

[19:25 - 19:30]
around them Details Matter saying a

[19:28 - 19:33]
dragon flying in the sky works but

[19:30 - 19:35]
saying a red dragon soaring through

[19:33 - 19:38]
stormy clouds lightning Illuminating

[19:35 - 19:41]
scales as it breathes fire into the

[19:38 - 19:43]
night takes it to a whole new level the

[19:41 - 19:46]
background don't skip it it ties the

[19:43 - 19:48]
whole vibe together and finally rapid in

[19:46 - 19:50]
style aesthetic this is like picking the

[19:48 - 19:52]
filter for your image how do you want it

[19:50 - 19:55]
to look is it a photo a painting or

[19:52 - 19:57]
maybe a 3D render what's the art style

[19:55 - 20:00]
impressionist cyber Punk or gothic Vibes

[19:57 - 20:03]
any artist and lence wanted to scream

[20:00 - 20:06]
Picasso or Studio gibl say it how about

[20:03 - 20:09]
framing do you want a closeup of the

[20:06 - 20:11]
subject's face or a dramatic wide shot

[20:09 - 20:13]
and like I said earlier there are roles

[20:11 - 20:15]
to follow as well the first rule of

[20:13 - 20:17]
prompting don't overthink it just

[20:15 - 20:19]
describe the image like you would to a

[20:17 - 20:21]
friend who's never seen it but here's

[20:19 - 20:23]
the thing lists of words can feel a

[20:21 - 20:25]
little well flat let me show you what I

[20:23 - 20:28]
mean here's a basic prompt cat Urban

[20:25 - 20:31]
Street cyber Punk neon nighttime High

[20:28 - 20:33]
quality it's clear enough but it's also

[20:31 - 20:35]
kind of bare bones now imagine if

[20:33 - 20:37]
instead of a list you painted a hall

[20:35 - 20:40]
scene something like this a sleek black

[20:37 - 20:42]
cat purged in the rain s Urban Street in

[20:40 - 20:45]
a glow cyberpunk city at night neon

[20:42 - 20:47]
signs in Electric Blues and pures

[20:45 - 20:49]
reflect off the wet pavement casting a

[20:47 - 20:52]
dreamy glow the cat's cybernetic eyes

[20:49 - 20:53]
shimmer Softly As It watches hover car

[20:52 - 20:56]
zip through the messy air in the

[20:53 - 20:59]
background see the

[20:56 - 21:01]
difference when it comes to prong length

[20:59 - 21:03]
there's no one siiz fits all some AI

[21:01 - 21:05]
love the Simplicity of short prompts

[21:03 - 21:08]
others Thrive when you get into all the

[21:05 - 21:10]
NRE details and you as a prompt engineer

[21:08 - 21:11]
have to find the right prompt length

[21:10 - 21:13]
depending on the complexity of the image

[21:11 - 21:16]
you're trying to generate check this out

[21:13 - 21:18]
this is a short pront a snowy mountain

[21:16 - 21:20]
range at Sunrise Golden Light hidden icy

[21:18 - 21:23]
peaks with a lone climber in the

[21:20 - 21:25]
distance short and sweet right gets the

[21:23 - 21:27]
job done if you want something simple

[21:25 - 21:29]
but sometimes adding a bit more

[21:27 - 21:31]
description brings out the magic let's

[21:29 - 21:33]
expand on that now we're starting to

[21:31 - 21:36]
feel the scene but what if we wanted to

[21:33 - 21:38]
go all in and add every little detail

[21:36 - 21:41]
here's how that could look think of

[21:38 - 21:43]
short prompts as quick sketches they are

[21:41 - 21:46]
great for getting ideas down fast medium

[21:43 - 21:48]
prompts are like roof drafts balanced in

[21:46 - 21:50]
creativity and control and long proms

[21:48 - 21:53]
those are your detailed masterpieces

[21:50 - 21:55]
where you have the final say over every

[21:53 - 21:57]
element with practice you'll know

[21:55 - 21:59]
exactly when to keep it short and when

[21:57 - 22:01]
to let your creativity flow the best

[21:59 - 22:03]
part is that every time you refine your

[22:01 - 22:06]
prompts you are sharpening your vision

[22:03 - 22:08]
for the Perfect

[22:06 - 22:10]
Image and sometimes you just have to be

[22:08 - 22:12]
negative you have to tell AI what you

[22:10 - 22:14]
don't want in your image that's called

[22:12 - 22:16]
negative prompting think of it as a

[22:14 - 22:18]
filter couldn't out distractions and

[22:16 - 22:20]
unwanted details whether you're trying

[22:18 - 22:23]
to avoid clashing Styles relevant

[22:20 - 22:26]
objects or specific colors negative PRS

[22:23 - 22:28]
help the AI zero in on your vision in

[22:26 - 22:30]
some image generators there is specific

[22:28 - 22:32]
specific area for a negative front where

[22:30 - 22:34]
you just list stuff in others you need

[22:32 - 22:37]
to modify the main front though it's

[22:34 - 22:39]
really easy to do you just type avoid or

[22:37 - 22:41]
exclude and then list the things you

[22:39 - 22:43]
don't want let's say you're creating a

[22:41 - 22:46]
peaceful beach scene you're imagining

[22:43 - 22:48]
crystal clear water white sand and a

[22:46 - 22:51]
Serene Vibe but instead of Tranquility

[22:48 - 22:52]
the AI gives you a modern beach resort

[22:51 - 22:54]
with buildings and umbrellas everywhere

[22:52 - 22:56]
here's where negative prompton shines

[22:54 - 22:58]
start by listing the elements you'd

[22:56 - 23:00]
prefer to exclude be specific instead in

[22:58 - 23:02]
of just thinking I don't want

[23:00 - 23:04]
distractions pinpoint exactly what those

[23:02 - 23:06]
distractions are is it a particular

[23:04 - 23:09]
style a certain type of object once

[23:06 - 23:10]
you've identified what to avoid add

[23:09 - 23:12]
those elements to your negative front

[23:10 - 23:15]
keep it specific and direct as vague

[23:12 - 23:17]
terms might not work as well so let's

[23:15 - 23:20]
say our main prompt looks like this

[23:17 - 23:21]
magical forest bath in soft Moonlight

[23:20 - 23:24]
glowing mushrooms scatter the forest

[23:21 - 23:26]
floor and ancient trees rise toward the

[23:24 - 23:29]
sky then the negative front would be

[23:26 - 23:32]
cabins Pathways buildings fences

[23:29 - 23:34]
artificial

[23:32 - 23:35]
lighting one thing that often slips

[23:34 - 23:38]
through the cracks when working with AI

[23:35 - 23:40]
image generators is resolution and

[23:38 - 23:42]
quality settings these might seem like

[23:40 - 23:44]
afterthoughts but they can make a huge

[23:42 - 23:45]
difference in the final look of your

1. Be specific and detailed about what you want. Rather than "Tell me about dogs," try "Explain the key differences between German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers in terms of temperament and care requirements."

2. Break complex tasks into steps. Instead of "Write me a business plan," try "First outline the key sections needed in a business plan, then let's work through each section systematically."

3. Provide context and constraints. For example: "Write a product description for a coffee mug. Target audience is young professionals. Tone should be casual but sophisticated. Maximum 100 words."

4. Use examples to demonstrate the desired output format. "Please analyze this code snippet. Format your response like this example: 'Bug risk: [High/Medium/Low], Main issues: [List], Suggested improvements: [List]'"

5. Request step-by-step reasoning for complex problems. "Walk through solving this math problem, showing your work at each step and explaining your reasoning."

6. State your expertise level and desired depth. "I'm a beginner programmer - please explain this concept using simple terms" or "I have advanced knowledge of machine learning - you can use technical terminology."

7. Specify the format you want. "Present this information as a table" or "Write this in a professional email format."

8. Ask for verification when needed. "Please confirm your understanding of my request before proceeding."

Excellent and detailed tutorial that covered everything I needed to refine the prompts I've been experimenting with. It's saved an enormous amount of trial and error. Much appreciated. Thank you.

### 4. @tinyfatgiant (üëç 6)
1. What the model really ‚Äúsees‚Äù ‚Äì‚Äì Text is first chopped into tokens, then each token becomes a vector inside a high-dimensional space. The network applies self-attention across the whole sequence; it never adds vectors in the crude way you suggested with ‚Äúcat plus sitting plus couch‚Äù.

2. Politeness is not fluff ‚Äì‚Äì Removing ‚Äúplease‚Äù and other civilities saves a handful of tokens, nothing more. Large chat models have been tuned on polite dialogue, so courtesy can even improve alignment. Focus on clarity, not on shaving two words.

3. Role prompts do not grant you a licence to trust the output ‚Äì‚Äì Telling the model to ‚Äúact as a patent lawyer‚Äù changes style and jargon; it does not enforce legal accuracy. If a human lawyer must review the draft, the same rule applies after role prompting.

4. Chain-of-thought is not the same as a checklist ‚Äì‚Äì Chain-of-thought prompting asks the model to display its reasoning. A checklist simply structures the answer. They work together but they are not interchangeable.

5. Sampling parameters ‚Äì‚Äì Temperature accepts values from zero to two. Writing ‚Äútemperature seven‚Äù is ignored or rejected. OpenAI chat endpoints expose top-p but not top-k. Check each vendor‚Äôs documentation before giving parameter advice.

6. How diffusion models build images ‚Äì‚Äì Diffusion models begin with latent noise and iteratively denoise it; they do not predict pixels outright. Most modern services now reach two thousand pixels on the long edge. Quoting a limit of one thousand and twenty-four betrays dated knowledge. The DPI metadata in a PNG has nothing to do with print sharpness. Only pixel dimensions matter.

### 6. @MrWednesday100 (üëç 70)
Great resource. I disagree with ditching the pleasantries, as a behavioural analyst, we understand how behaviour can generalise across settings, a red light at a traffic stop for instance is generalised to mean stop / danger / pause / incorrect for instance. If we through interactions with AI create a space where we no longer need to be polite, but we are still (from the perspective of the human) interacting with something through dialogue to get the AI to do what we want it to, this can quickly generalise across settings that involve interactions with humans as well, such as service staff, receptionists, support workers etc, often low paid work with little recognition to begin with. Adding a please or thank you will not mess up the instruction or impact the prompt, and if anything can in turn be used as positive reinforcement learning for the machines as well. We want to encourage the development and persistent use of socially important behaviours, of which politeness (adjusted for cultural variance) is built in as a norm.

> **@icns01** (üëç 8): Well said. Completely agree.

> **@LivinginDowntownPhoenix** (üëç 4): Completely agree with you there. It's good training for the AI and for yourself to use culturally acceptable human language.

> **@stylesali7939** (üëç 4): I completely Agree üéâüéâüéâ

> **@dndallasta** (üëç 4): This is an interesting take, but I think these things are kinda hard-coded in humans through years of culture and civilization anyway. Sam Harris has talked about how future interactions with human-like AI androids would be like and the gist of it is that you'd pretty much have to be a literal psycopath to behave with an android like the characters in Westworld do. Seems like our brain wouldn't allow anything else. Hell, I've insulted GPT and I've felt remorse over it, lol.

> **@MrWednesday100** (üëç 3): @ it‚Äôs a valid point but I stand by the generalisation of behaviour over time. There‚Äôs a difference between westworld level psychopathic abuse, and incrementally becoming more rude, impatient, and demanding when interacting with things or people we want something from. There is plenty of literature in psychology and behavioural science to show how our behavioural repertoire can change when we are given positions of power or authority - and we will (hopefully!) have ‚Äòpower‚Äô over AI in our interactions with it. But as this is all relatively new we will just have to see. I think the actual answer is more commonsensical - it doesn‚Äôt cost anything to be polite, better to keep it that way.

### 10. @techdiasphere (üëç 3)
Hey, first off, congratulations on your video! I really enjoyed the insights you shared, and it's great to see such enthusiasm for prompt engineering. I noticed you mentioned that tweaking the "temp" parameter can influence the output on the web interface. I wanted to clarify that while the underlying model does use a temperature setting, users interacting via the web interface don‚Äôt actually have the ability to adjust it. That parameter is something you can change only when using the API, not in the standard web chat.

In the web interface, the system is set up with fixed internal configurations optimized by OpenAI, so the best way to steer responses isn‚Äôt by fiddling with technical details like temperature. Instead, you can describe the style or tone you‚Äôre looking for. If you want a more creative or diverse answer, you could say something like, "Be creative and offer diverse ideas." Conversely, if you're aiming for a straightforward, detailed response, asking, "Please provide a precise answer," usually does the trick. This approach achieves the desired effect without relying on any hidden parameters.

> **@happydeux2254** (üëç 0): 100%, you can't adjust underlying parameters as a user. At least not in GPT and not in mid-2025. The model may however, interpret what you're trying to achieve and respond accordingly but you're better off saying it in plain language to be in more control.

### 14. @NoahSpurrier (üëç 24)
I disagree with rule 1. Pleasantries are harmless and don‚Äôt affect output. It also helps reinforce your social habits so you don‚Äôt slip into barking your pointlessly specific demands as some day it may happen that you actually have to talk to a human being. Also, if these AI models ever do become sentient and self aware it might be somehow beneficial if they remember that you were one of the humans that was always kind to them.

> **@RaffyBoss** (üëç 4): Unfortunately according to open ai being polite to Ai is burning a hole in their pocket... Especially if using those that cost you per token, not being pleasant is the better way to go.

> **@brownell.landrum** (üëç 1): I was going to say the same thing. The last thing we need is to train a society to be less pleasant. We have enough of that already.
