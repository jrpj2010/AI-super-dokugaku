[00:00 - 00:05]
AI is slowly leading us to a K-shaped

[00:02 - 00:08]
economy where 20% of job skills will

[00:05 - 00:10]
become 10 times more productive and 80%

[00:08 - 00:12]
of job skills will become simply

[00:10 - 00:14]
outdated. And if you think AI is just

[00:12 - 00:16]
for technical people, then you're wrong.

[00:14 - 00:20]
So, how exactly should a non-technical

[00:16 - 00:21]
beginner learn AI in 2025? And if you're

[00:20 - 00:23]
building a business, what tools should

[00:21 - 00:27]
you learn for each and every department

[00:23 - 00:28]
of your company to grow your profits?

[00:27 - 00:30]
There are three important lessons to

[00:28 - 00:32]
help you get started. And I've learned

[00:30 - 00:34]
these lessons after training companies

[00:32 - 00:36]
across the world on top AI tools at the

[00:34 - 00:39]
cutting edge school. Lesson number one,

[00:36 - 00:41]
build a routine of testing AI tools.

[00:39 - 00:43]
Billionaire co-founder and CTO of

[00:41 - 00:45]
HubSpot, Dhmesh Sha, has a newsletter

[00:43 - 00:47]
called Simple.AI and he shared a

[00:45 - 00:48]
strategy for keeping up with AI. But

[00:47 - 00:50]
before I give you that, let's revise

[00:48 - 00:52]
some first principles I've covered

[00:50 - 00:54]
before. Number one, you need to start by

[00:52 - 00:56]
becoming a user of AI and not

[00:54 - 00:58]
necessarily a technical builder. What AI

[00:56 - 01:00]
tools should you use is something I will

[00:58 - 01:03]
answer in just a few minutes. Number

[01:00 - 01:05]
two, the world will see a rise in demand

[01:03 - 01:08]
for AI operators and AI builders. Now,

[01:05 - 01:09]
AI operators are those who know how to

[01:08 - 01:12]
prompt AI and work with them. AI

[01:09 - 01:14]
builders are the technical ones that can

[01:12 - 01:15]
build AI solutions. If you're a

[01:14 - 01:18]
non-technical beginner, then you can

[01:15 - 01:20]
easily start by becoming an AI operator.

[01:18 - 01:22]
So the big question is how exactly do

[01:20 - 01:24]
you become an AI operator? Number three,

[01:22 - 01:26]
AI is not a cheap replacement. You need

[01:24 - 01:28]
a smart and an educated professional to

[01:26 - 01:31]
prompt these tools and then validate

[01:28 - 01:32]
their outputs. Number four, whatever AI

[01:31 - 01:35]
that you're seeing right now is the

[01:32 - 01:37]
latest worst. It's still learning and

[01:35 - 01:39]
will continue to grow. Number five,

[01:37 - 01:41]
everyone is starting from zero. This

[01:39 - 01:43]
means that you have an opportunity to

[01:41 - 01:45]
get a solid head start. Whoever starts

[01:43 - 01:48]
learning today will be one of those rare

[01:45 - 01:50]
people having 5 years of experience in

[01:48 - 01:52]
2030. On number six, the world will

[01:50 - 01:55]
reward people with good health, great

[01:52 - 01:57]
taste, pattern finding skills, and the

[01:55 - 01:59]
vocabulary to describe those patterns.

[01:57 - 02:01]
And you will be essentially limited by

[01:59 - 02:04]
how good your writing and vocabulary is.

[02:01 - 02:06]
But an how do we improve our vocabulary?

[02:04 - 02:08]
How can someone improve their taste so

[02:06 - 02:10]
quickly? because all of these things

[02:08 - 02:12]
take so much time and we barely have

[02:10 - 02:14]
enough head space to learn these things

[02:12 - 02:16]
on our own. I get where you're coming

[02:14 - 02:18]
from. So, here is a routine that you can

[02:16 - 02:20]
steal from me. Let's assume you're a

[02:18 - 02:21]
professional who wants to improve her AI

[02:20 - 02:23]
skills in a specific niche. And this

[02:21 - 02:25]
could be anything from finance to

[02:23 - 02:28]
marketing to whatever it is. Step number

[02:25 - 02:30]
one is to shortlist an area of your

[02:28 - 02:32]
day-to-day work where you are wasting

[02:30 - 02:33]
too much time. This could be writing,

[02:32 - 02:35]
researching scheduling planning

[02:33 - 02:37]
whatever it may be. Step number two is

[02:35 - 02:39]
to find the best AI tool on the market

[02:37 - 02:41]
for that use case and get the pro

[02:39 - 02:43]
version of that tool. And yes, free

[02:41 - 02:46]
versions are not good enough. And you

[02:43 - 02:48]
can do this searching exercise by simply

[02:46 - 02:50]
running a basic prompt on Gro 3. And by

[02:48 - 02:52]
the way, Gro 3 is free. And then simply

[02:50 - 02:54]
go through those tools one by one. Step

[02:52 - 02:56]
three is to run these tools daily at

[02:54 - 02:58]
your work and run very small small

[02:56 - 03:00]
experiments and start building your

[02:58 - 03:03]
intuition. Step number four is to

[03:00 - 03:04]
schedule quarterly reviews for yourself

[03:03 - 03:06]
where you keep checking online if there

[03:04 - 03:09]
are any other new tools or prompts

[03:06 - 03:11]
available in the market. But how will I

[03:09 - 03:14]
know which AI tool is best for each of

[03:11 - 03:16]
my use cases? What if I don't trust any

[03:14 - 03:17]
random recommendations by Grock? The

[03:16 - 03:20]
good news is that I have made a list of

[03:17 - 03:22]
tools that I personally use for each and

[03:20 - 03:25]
every department of my company. So here

[03:22 - 03:27]
is a list of top recommended AI tools

[03:25 - 03:29]
that I have personally used in 2024.

[03:27 - 03:33]
This is not a sponsored list and it is

[03:29 - 03:34]
100% genuine. So as of April 2025 and

[03:33 - 03:36]
I'm adding this month because I know

[03:34 - 03:38]
that in future my tools will also change

[03:36 - 03:40]
but as of now for image generation,

[03:38 - 03:43]
YouTube thumbnails and logo design

[03:40 - 03:46]
inspiration I pick from Chad GPT forro

[03:43 - 03:48]
and Ioggram. For deep research on any

[03:46 - 03:50]
topic I pick Google Gemini. For

[03:48 - 03:52]
recording my meetings, my notes and just

[03:50 - 03:55]
having a transcript of all of my Google

[03:52 - 03:57]
Meet calls I pick Loom. If you want to

[03:55 - 03:59]
make chat GPT bots, which means a

[03:57 - 04:01]
chatbot that remembers your use case and

[03:59 - 04:04]
context and repeats daily writing tasks,

[04:01 - 04:06]
then pick chat GPT. For AI avatars, pick

[04:04 - 04:08]
Hen. And you can see these in action on

[04:06 - 04:11]
our other Instagram page at the cutting

[04:08 - 04:13]
edge school. For AI voice, where you can

[04:11 - 04:15]
clone your voice or your client's voice,

[04:13 - 04:18]
use 11 Labs. For writing scripts and

[04:15 - 04:20]
marketing copy, pick Claude. For

[04:18 - 04:22]
presentations, pick GMA. For

[04:20 - 04:25]
brainstorming, pick Gro 3's thinking

[04:22 - 04:28]
mode. For no code development, choose

[04:25 - 04:30]
from either lovable, bold, or replet.

[04:28 - 04:31]
We've already made detailed tutorials on

[04:30 - 04:33]
these. You'll find them on our YouTube

[04:31 - 04:36]
channel. For building AI agents for your

[04:33 - 04:38]
agency, choose nitn. For automation,

[04:36 - 04:41]
choose make. Now, two important things

[04:38 - 04:42]
to note. None of these good tools are

[04:41 - 04:44]
available for free. In fact, no tech

[04:42 - 04:46]
company would ever give you anything

[04:44 - 04:48]
valuable for free. Number two, these

[04:46 - 04:51]
tools keep on changing very fast. A few

[04:48 - 04:53]
months ago, Ideogram was the best at

[04:51 - 04:56]
making text. Then one week back Chad

[04:53 - 04:58]
GP40 surpassed everyone else. Hence you

[04:56 - 05:00]
need to make sure that you keep a tab on

[04:58 - 05:02]
these fast changes or simply work with a

[05:00 - 05:04]
mentor. But an what if we don't have a

[05:02 - 05:06]
mentor? What if we don't want to

[05:04 - 05:08]
self-learn and need someone to guide us

[05:06 - 05:10]
end to end because we're too busy in our

[05:08 - 05:12]
day-to-day work. So if you're serious

[05:10 - 05:14]
about investing in learning AI, data

[05:12 - 05:16]
science or any high demand tech skill,

[05:14 - 05:18]
then you can choose a structured

[05:16 - 05:21]
learning path from industry experts

[05:18 - 05:23]
using simply learn. Simply Learn is one

[05:21 - 05:25]
of the world's leading online learning

[05:23 - 05:27]
platforms offering certification

[05:25 - 05:30]
programs in AI, machine learning, data

[05:27 - 05:32]
science, cloud computing, and much more.

[05:30 - 05:34]
If you're new to AI, the generative AI

[05:32 - 05:37]
for beginners course is perfect for you.

[05:34 - 05:39]
It covers basic concepts like prompt

[05:37 - 05:42]
engineering, AI models, text and image

[05:39 - 05:44]
generation in a very simple way. Instead

[05:42 - 05:46]
of just giving you pre-recorded videos,

[05:44 - 05:48]
their courses are designed in

[05:46 - 05:52]
collaboration with top universities and

[05:48 - 05:54]
companies like MIT and IBM. So you are

[05:52 - 05:56]
getting real job ready skills. It has

[05:54 - 05:59]
earned top ratings on platforms like

[05:56 - 06:01]
Forbes, Switch Up and Course Report and

[05:59 - 06:02]
has helped thousands of learners take

[06:01 - 06:04]
their careers to the next level. So

[06:02 - 06:06]
whether you're just starting out or

[06:04 - 06:08]
looking to upskill, this could be your

[06:06 - 06:10]
opportunity to level up. But what is so

[06:08 - 06:12]
special about SimplyLearn that is not

[06:10 - 06:14]
available anywhere else? First, they

[06:12 - 06:16]
focus a lot on real world practice. So,

[06:14 - 06:18]
you can get hands-on experience with

[06:16 - 06:20]
projects that actually matter. Next, all

[06:18 - 06:22]
students get to learn from experts

[06:20 - 06:24]
because after enrolling, they attend

[06:22 - 06:26]
live sessions led by top industry

[06:24 - 06:28]
professionals and global leaders. And

[06:26 - 06:30]
most importantly, the brands that they

[06:28 - 06:31]
have collaborated with are globally

[06:30 - 06:34]
recognized. So, their courses are

[06:31 - 06:36]
trusted and rated highly by Forbes and

[06:34 - 06:38]
other rating platforms. They also have

[06:36 - 06:40]
courses in trending fields like data

[06:38 - 06:42]
science, cyber security, product and

[06:40 - 06:44]
design which you can find on their

[06:42 - 06:46]
website menu. You can know more about

[06:44 - 06:47]
simply learns programs by going to the

[06:46 - 06:49]
link in description or the pinned

[06:47 - 06:53]
comment. Lesson number two, start

[06:49 - 06:55]
building or operating AI agents. But an

[06:53 - 06:56]
what are AI agents and how are they

[06:55 - 06:59]
different from a normal AI tool like

[06:56 - 07:01]
Chad GPT? We've already made a very

[06:59 - 07:03]
detailed three-part course on AI agents,

[07:01 - 07:04]
but still let's quickly revise. A

[07:03 - 07:06]
traditional AI tool is like a

[07:04 - 07:08]
calculator. It can compute numbers but

[07:06 - 07:10]
it cannot take initiative or make

[07:08 - 07:12]
decisions on its own. You kind of have

[07:10 - 07:13]
to take the calculator and manually

[07:12 - 07:15]
operate it each and every time you want

[07:13 - 07:17]
to use it. And once you have the results

[07:15 - 07:19]
from a calculator, you actually have to

[07:17 - 07:21]
take financial decisions by referring

[07:19 - 07:23]
your Excel sheets. An AI agent on the

[07:21 - 07:25]
other hand is more like a personal

[07:23 - 07:27]
assistant that can proactively take

[07:25 - 07:29]
actions to achieve goals that you set.

[07:27 - 07:31]
So imagine having an assistant that

[07:29 - 07:33]
doesn't just wait for your instructions,

[07:31 - 07:35]
but it can actually see the bigger

[07:33 - 07:37]
picture. It can actually understand the

[07:35 - 07:40]
broader context of what you want to

[07:37 - 07:42]
accomplish across different tools and

[07:40 - 07:44]
then break down complicated tasks into

[07:42 - 07:46]
smaller steps and in the end make

[07:44 - 07:49]
decisions about the best way to achieve

[07:46 - 07:51]
those goals. But wait a second, this

[07:49 - 07:53]
sounds as if AI agents are not actual

[07:51 - 07:55]
AI. Then how exactly can we learn AI

[07:53 - 07:57]
agents when we don't even know how to

[07:55 - 08:00]
use AI? You're right. AI agents are an

[07:57 - 08:02]
outcome of AI. And before you jump to AI

[08:00 - 08:04]
agents, you need to learn something way

[08:02 - 08:07]
way more basic. Let me explain. AI

[08:04 - 08:10]
agents are not AI models. So stuff like

[08:07 - 08:12]
chat GPT, Claude, Gemini, these are not

[08:10 - 08:16]
agents, by the way. These are interfaces

[08:12 - 08:18]
to use AI models. You use chat GPT as an

[08:16 - 08:21]
interface to have a conversation with

[08:18 - 08:23]
all the AI models that OpenAI is

[08:21 - 08:26]
creating. So you can use chat GPT to

[08:23 - 08:31]
actually utilize the intelligence of

[08:26 - 08:33]
GPT40. So GPT40, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 2.5,

[08:31 - 08:35]
these are all AI models that are

[08:33 - 08:38]
actually driving all of these apps and

[08:35 - 08:40]
chats. Now AI agents are workflows.

[08:38 - 08:42]
These workflows can be decided by you or

[08:40 - 08:44]
your team members. to run these

[08:42 - 08:46]
workflows to calculate small small

[08:44 - 08:49]
decisions while these workflows are

[08:46 - 08:52]
being executed. AI agents can use any of

[08:49 - 08:54]
these AI models to run your list of

[08:52 - 08:56]
tasks. I'm sure you would have heard

[08:54 - 08:58]
about Manis the Chinese AI agents

[08:56 - 09:00]
company. It became super viral. People

[08:58 - 09:03]
think that Manis is some new AI tool

[09:00 - 09:05]
like Chad GPD, but it is not. It is

[09:03 - 09:07]
actually an AI agent that uses an

[09:05 - 09:10]
existing AI model for its core

[09:07 - 09:12]
intelligence. Manis is actually using

[09:10 - 09:14]
Claude 3.5 sonnet for its intelligence.

[09:12 - 09:15]
And moving forward, there's a high

[09:14 - 09:17]
chance that they would switch from

[09:15 - 09:18]
Claude to something else. So

[09:17 - 09:21]
fundamentally, Manis is nothing but

[09:18 - 09:23]
Claude combined with an extra layer, an

[09:21 - 09:26]
extra feature of being able to use and

[09:23 - 09:28]
operate extra tools on the internet. But

[09:26 - 09:30]
how exactly will these agents work with

[09:28 - 09:32]
us? And why exactly are we learning

[09:30 - 09:34]
anything in life when these AI agents

[09:32 - 09:36]
alone can do all of our work? Let me

[09:34 - 09:38]
explain.

[09:36 - 09:40]
So in an optimistic future, you and your

[09:38 - 09:42]
teammates won't be executing on

[09:40 - 09:44]
softwares. You will be spending a lot of

[09:42 - 09:47]
your daily time giving instructions to

[09:44 - 09:49]
AI agents who will further run all of

[09:47 - 09:51]
your softwares and workflows. In fact,

[09:49 - 09:53]
there's a high chance that in the next 2

[09:51 - 09:55]
years, your company will have a network

[09:53 - 09:57]
of such agents working together and you

[09:55 - 09:59]
will be having a conversation with them

[09:57 - 10:01]
on Slack or on WhatsApp. As a consulting

[09:59 - 10:04]
company, we have been building an army

[10:01 - 10:06]
of AI agents for a lot of our clients

[10:04 - 10:07]
and it has helped them save days of

[10:06 - 10:09]
manual effort. I'll put my email in

[10:07 - 10:11]
description in case you also want to

[10:09 - 10:13]
explore something for your company. The

[10:11 - 10:15]
important thing to note here is that an

[10:13 - 10:17]
agent is not tied to a specific AI

[10:15 - 10:19]
model. If you decide to build a script

[10:17 - 10:21]
writing agent today using net, it can

[10:19 - 10:23]
run on any AI model like chat GPT,

[10:21 - 10:25]
Claude or Gemini. So the model is kind

[10:23 - 10:27]
of independent from the workflow which

[10:25 - 10:29]
means as long as you are smart enough to

[10:27 - 10:30]
write down all steps of your work you

[10:29 - 10:32]
are sorted because you are not

[10:30 - 10:34]
responsible for the intelligence with

[10:32 - 10:36]
which these agents will run your list.

[10:34 - 10:38]
As long as your systems are properly

[10:36 - 10:40]
documented all you can do is bet on the

[10:38 - 10:43]
fact that these models will become

[10:40 - 10:45]
better faster and cheaper. However, you

[10:43 - 10:47]
still need to write down every little

[10:45 - 10:49]
task in utmost detail. That is why it's

[10:47 - 10:51]
extremely important for you and your

[10:49 - 10:53]
team members to improve your core

[10:51 - 10:55]
skills. your writing skills and read a

[10:53 - 10:57]
lot about your subject's first

[10:55 - 10:59]
principles. People who read and

[10:57 - 11:01]
understand their core subject have the

[10:59 - 11:03]
vocabulary to accurately describe what

[11:01 - 11:04]
they want. But there is one very

[11:03 - 11:07]
important human area that very few

[11:04 - 11:10]
people are talking about and it is very

[11:07 - 11:12]
far away from agents or AI. Most people

[11:10 - 11:15]
will lose if they do not learn this

[11:12 - 11:17]
skill and that is the skill of having

[11:15 - 11:19]
better judgment.

[11:17 - 11:22]
So I've already spoken about this in our

[11:19 - 11:23]
chat GP 40 video but let me revise.

[11:22 - 11:26]
After you have understood your first

[11:23 - 11:28]
principles and repeating patterns at

[11:26 - 11:30]
work, you still need to interpret and

[11:28 - 11:32]
judge what those patterns are saying to

[11:30 - 11:34]
you. Understanding the context of what

[11:32 - 11:36]
is needed from you is never simple. It's

[11:34 - 11:38]
something which is very nuanced and

[11:36 - 11:40]
extremely subjective. The only way to

[11:38 - 11:42]
improve your judgment is by working with

[11:40 - 11:44]
other people on real projects and keep

[11:42 - 11:46]
iterating and keep documenting your

[11:44 - 11:48]
results. When you carefully notice and

[11:46 - 11:50]
write, your brain starts finding

[11:48 - 11:52]
connections between stretch subjects. So

[11:50 - 11:54]
you'll start finding overlaps. So talk

[11:52 - 11:56]
to more people, understand how they

[11:54 - 11:58]
think and behave, become extremely good

[11:56 - 12:01]
at predicting human behavior. Read a lot

[11:58 - 12:02]
about cognitive psychology and behavior

[12:01 - 12:05]
sciences. All of these subjects will

[12:02 - 12:06]
help you sharpen your judgment skills.

[12:05 - 12:08]
But an are all of these things even

[12:06 - 12:10]
important? Like I thought learning

[12:08 - 12:12]
prompt engineering is the hot thing. I

[12:10 - 12:14]
know many people who read a lot. They

[12:12 - 12:16]
are great pattern finders. They even

[12:14 - 12:18]
know AI tools but their judgment and

[12:16 - 12:19]
interpretation are very very weak. So

[12:18 - 12:21]
they end up taking wrong decisions

[12:19 - 12:24]
because their priorities are all over

[12:21 - 12:26]
the place. T-shaped generalists who

[12:24 - 12:29]
understand human behavior will be paid

[12:26 - 12:31]
maximum. Designers, PMs, and developers,

[12:29 - 12:33]
all of these designations will start

[12:31 - 12:35]
coming under one umbrella. For content,

[12:33 - 12:37]
visual storyboarding artists, editors,

[12:35 - 12:39]
and motion designers will again come

[12:37 - 12:42]
under one single umbrella. The talent

[12:39 - 12:43]
stack is collapsing and the world will

[12:42 - 12:45]
start rewarding people who are fast

[12:43 - 12:47]
learners, strong pattern finders and

[12:45 - 12:49]
have the ability to practice good

[12:47 - 12:52]
judgment. There's a very interesting

[12:49 - 12:54]
image that I saw by David Arnox that

[12:52 - 12:56]
spoke about five levels of an autonomous

[12:54 - 12:58]
business. Every founder and team leader

[12:56 - 13:00]
watching this video right now needs to

[12:58 - 13:03]
carefully understand this image. This

[13:00 - 13:06]
framework shows you exactly how to go

[13:03 - 13:09]
from a peopleheavy unsistatic chaotic

[13:06 - 13:12]
company to a lean automated machine that

[13:09 - 13:14]
can run with limited people augmented

[13:12 - 13:16]
with AI agents. Remember how we spoke

[13:14 - 13:18]
about AI automation versus AI

[13:16 - 13:19]
augmentation. For those of you who are

[13:18 - 13:23]
new here, the World Economic Forum

[13:19 - 13:25]
report on future of jobs said that 86%

[13:23 - 13:27]
of businesses globally are planning to

[13:25 - 13:29]
include AI automation. Now, anytime I

[13:27 - 13:31]
say the word AI automation, people just

[13:29 - 13:32]
think that AI will do everything on its

[13:31 - 13:34]
own and humans will just need to press a

[13:32 - 13:36]
button. It never works that way. And if

[13:34 - 13:38]
you've seen the human AI workflow, you

[13:36 - 13:40]
know what I'm talking about. Honestly,

[13:38 - 13:43]
the most valuable tech jobs will have AI

[13:40 - 13:45]
augmentation instead of pure blind AI

[13:43 - 13:47]
automation. Let me explain you what that

[13:45 - 13:49]
means. Assume a task has 100 steps. A

[13:47 - 13:53]
survey done by World Economic Forum

[13:49 - 13:55]
showed that today 47% of these tasks are

[13:53 - 13:57]
done by people alone. 30% of them are

[13:55 - 14:00]
done by a combination of tech and people

[13:57 - 14:02]
and 22% tasks are done just by

[14:00 - 14:05]
technology alone. In the next 5 years,

[14:02 - 14:07]
this split will become almost even. 33%

[14:05 - 14:10]
will be done using a combination of

[14:07 - 14:12]
humans and tech and 34% will be done

[14:10 - 14:14]
only by tech. Our video on the WF report

[14:12 - 14:15]
discussed some very important core

[14:14 - 14:17]
skills that you and your team would need

[14:15 - 14:19]
to learn to become a part of this 33%.

[14:17 - 14:21]
I'll share that link in description. But

[14:19 - 14:23]
today, let us first understand these

[14:21 - 14:25]
five levels of an autonomous business.

[14:23 - 14:27]
Anybody an entrepreneur or freelancer

[14:25 - 14:29]
seeing this if you are watching this

[14:27 - 14:31]
carefully I'm telling you this will

[14:29 - 14:34]
inspire you to set up better systems and

[14:31 - 14:35]
actually learn AI from today itself. So

[14:34 - 14:37]
most first-time entrepreneurs are

[14:35 - 14:39]
usually stuck at level one where

[14:37 - 14:41]
everything is dependent on humans.

[14:39 - 14:43]
People are making every single decision

[14:41 - 14:45]
and doing every single task manually.

[14:43 - 14:47]
Technology is barely involved. You might

[14:45 - 14:49]
be using basic stuff like slides and

[14:47 - 14:51]
spreadsheets or emails but there is

[14:49 - 14:53]
barely anything cutting edge or new.

[14:51 - 14:55]
This is where most small businesses

[14:53 - 14:57]
start and it's completely okay. The

[14:55 - 15:00]
problem is such small businesses do not

[14:57 - 15:01]
scale well. Everything breaks down if

[15:00 - 15:03]
one person is missing from the team

[15:01 - 15:05]
because the team is very lean and

[15:03 - 15:07]
everyone has too much of responsibility.

[15:05 - 15:09]
Level two brings in basic automation

[15:07 - 15:11]
which is called the assisted level. You

[15:09 - 15:13]
might start automating repetitive tasks

[15:11 - 15:15]
like sending emails or generating

[15:13 - 15:17]
invoices. You might be using a little

[15:15 - 15:19]
bit of Chad GPT or any other tool like

[15:17 - 15:22]
GMA or notion or loom. But the core

[15:19 - 15:24]
decisions are still human-led and you're

[15:22 - 15:26]
kind of like still driving the car even

[15:24 - 15:28]
if cruise control is on. It is still not

[15:26 - 15:29]
automated but still better than level

[15:28 - 15:32]
one. But the truth is you're still

[15:29 - 15:35]
working in the business and not on it.

[15:32 - 15:36]
Level three is semiautonomous. Do not

[15:35 - 15:37]
worry about the word. It's pretty

[15:36 - 15:40]
simple. This is where we start entering

[15:37 - 15:42]
a very powerful territory. So at this

[15:40 - 15:44]
level three, your company systems handle

[15:42 - 15:45]
most of the day-to-day work, which means

[15:44 - 15:47]
that you have written down every little

[15:45 - 15:49]
thing. There's a proper list that all

[15:47 - 15:51]
team members follow. You've actually sat

[15:49 - 15:54]
down and written down protocols and

[15:51 - 15:56]
SOPs. You've documented your processes

[15:54 - 15:58]
and now your tools, stuff like notion,

[15:56 - 16:00]
Zapier or Slack are taking care of

[15:58 - 16:02]
repetitive tasks. So you're not afraid

[16:00 - 16:04]
of one person leaving the company

[16:02 - 16:05]
because it is the SOPs and processes

[16:04 - 16:08]
that are doing the job. and senior

[16:05 - 16:09]
people step in only for complicated

[16:08 - 16:11]
situations or when the system gets

[16:09 - 16:13]
stuck. This is usually when your team is

[16:11 - 16:15]
facing a problem that has no written

[16:13 - 16:18]
solution for it. So in this level you as

[16:15 - 16:20]
a founder are no longer a firefighter.

[16:18 - 16:21]
You basically become a process builder.

[16:20 - 16:23]
Somebody who's hiring people and

[16:21 - 16:25]
creating processes where those people

[16:23 - 16:27]
can fit in. And this is where I am

[16:25 - 16:29]
currently after running my company for

[16:27 - 16:31]
one year. Level four is fully

[16:29 - 16:33]
autonomous. This is where things become

[16:31 - 16:34]
very very exciting. And this is still

[16:33 - 16:36]
not achieved yet, but this is where

[16:34 - 16:38]
people are trying to move and this is

[16:36 - 16:40]
what you need to prepare for. So at

[16:38 - 16:42]
level four, nearly everything is

[16:40 - 16:45]
augmented. Please note I'm using the

[16:42 - 16:47]
word augmented and not replaced. Every

[16:45 - 16:48]
single process is augmented with

[16:47 - 16:51]
experienced humans whether it's

[16:48 - 16:53]
marketing, onboarding, customer support

[16:51 - 16:55]
and all functions have AI agents

[16:53 - 16:57]
established and seniors are just

[16:55 - 17:00]
briefing and validating which each of

[16:57 - 17:02]
these AI agents. The core team only

[17:00 - 17:05]
oversees performance or handles rare

[17:02 - 17:06]
edge cases. So nobody's checking every

[17:05 - 17:08]
hour to see if things are working

[17:06 - 17:10]
because all the AI agents know what to

[17:08 - 17:12]
do. They have proper timelines. They

[17:10 - 17:14]
have uploaded systems and they're

[17:12 - 17:16]
completing every single detail. Now this

[17:14 - 17:18]
is how modern companies are planning to

[17:16 - 17:20]
run six figure businesses remotely and

[17:18 - 17:22]
this is what you can also build or you

[17:20 - 17:24]
can be good enough to be a part of such

[17:22 - 17:27]
companies if you start learning today.

[17:24 - 17:29]
In the past two years, we have made so

[17:27 - 17:32]
many videos teaching the basics of chat

[17:29 - 17:34]
GPT, social media using AI, video

[17:32 - 17:37]
editing using AI, marketing using AI. We

[17:34 - 17:40]
have taught every foundational skill

[17:37 - 17:42]
absolutely for free. All you need to do

[17:40 - 17:44]
is sit down, invest enough time and

[17:42 - 17:46]
learn. On level five, we have a

[17:44 - 17:48]
self-evolving business which is still

[17:46 - 17:51]
fictional. It is still in theory, but it

[17:48 - 17:53]
is where this entire picture comes

[17:51 - 17:54]
together. And if this happens, the world

[17:53 - 17:57]
will change forever. Now this is where

[17:54 - 17:59]
your systems and AI agents not only run

[17:57 - 18:01]
on their own but they start improving on

[17:59 - 18:03]
their own. So the network of AI agents

[18:01 - 18:05]
keep checking their own results and

[18:03 - 18:08]
through machine learning they themselves

[18:05 - 18:10]
start suggesting themselves on how to

[18:08 - 18:11]
improve. So your social media copy and

[18:10 - 18:13]
your ads and everything they start

[18:11 - 18:15]
adjusting themselves. Your operations

[18:13 - 18:17]
keep getting smarter over time. At this

[18:15 - 18:20]
stage you are running a learning

[18:17 - 18:21]
business not just an automated one. And

[18:20 - 18:23]
I know that this sounds very

[18:21 - 18:26]
intimidating and scary at the same time.

[18:23 - 18:29]
I am 100% sure that we need to put some

[18:26 - 18:31]
limits to such self-evolving systems as

[18:29 - 18:33]
well. It's almost like playing with fire

[18:31 - 18:36]
and kerosene where both are extremely

[18:33 - 18:38]
volatile forces. But if controlled, they

[18:36 - 18:39]
can fuel industries across the world.

[18:38 - 18:42]
Think about it for a second. I'm pretty

[18:39 - 18:44]
sure the bunch of people who first found

[18:42 - 18:46]
fire were extremely freaked out. And I'm

[18:44 - 18:48]
pretty sure it was obvious that fire can

[18:46 - 18:49]
kill. And I think it would be after a

[18:48 - 18:51]
year or two when they would have

[18:49 - 18:54]
realized that fire can actually do a lot

[18:51 - 18:56]
more. Fire can help us melt metals and

[18:54 - 18:58]
help us create a camera, a phone or a

[18:56 - 19:00]
computer or whatever it may be. So we're

[18:58 - 19:02]
kind of like repeating a historical

[19:00 - 19:03]
pattern where we've found an untapped

[19:02 - 19:05]
power where we have discovered

[19:03 - 19:07]
something. I never use the word

[19:05 - 19:08]
invention in general because if you

[19:07 - 19:10]
really think about it, you're not

[19:08 - 19:12]
inventing anything. As human beings,

[19:10 - 19:15]
we're just discovering how to already

[19:12 - 19:17]
use the raw materials that were present

[19:15 - 19:19]
on this planet since the big bang. So,

[19:17 - 19:21]
we're just discovering that AI is

[19:19 - 19:23]
possible. Like just a few years ago, we

[19:21 - 19:25]
discovered that Wi-Fi is possible. And

[19:23 - 19:26]
because of Wi-Fi, someone created

[19:25 - 19:28]
YouTube and you are here watching me

[19:26 - 19:31]
now. It's obvious that as you move up

[19:28 - 19:33]
the levels, the number of people blindly

[19:31 - 19:35]
following prescriptions or orders is

[19:33 - 19:37]
going to go down because it's so so

[19:35 - 19:39]
obvious that the way work happens will

[19:37 - 19:41]
change rapidly. And as the business

[19:39 - 19:43]
evolves, the need for people,

[19:41 - 19:45]
professional and smart people who not

[19:43 - 19:47]
only understand their work and who are

[19:45 - 19:49]
not only good communicators and writers,

[19:47 - 19:52]
but these are people who understand AI

[19:49 - 19:54]
and context and strategy. As you move up

[19:52 - 19:56]
to the ladder, the number of people per

[19:54 - 19:59]
business will go down, but the number of

[19:56 - 20:01]
new businesses will go 10x. If we as a

[19:59 - 20:02]
modern society keep on learning and

[20:01 - 20:04]
evolving and prepare each other to

[20:02 - 20:07]
become better entrepreneurs and not just

[20:04 - 20:09]
followers in a span of 20 to 35 years

[20:07 - 20:10]
things will balance out. And I'm not

[20:09 - 20:12]
saying that this journey will be easy.

[20:10 - 20:14]
I'm preparing you beforehand. People who

[20:12 - 20:16]
do not learn, people who keep on

[20:14 - 20:17]
avoiding and ignoring like I have been

[20:16 - 20:19]
making videos for the past 2 and 1/2

[20:17 - 20:22]
years. People who do not take this

[20:19 - 20:24]
seriously, who do not upskill will get a

[20:22 - 20:27]
hit on their paychecks. And it is sad

[20:24 - 20:30]
but it is the truth. But this is where

[20:27 - 20:32]
evolution wants us to flow. Evolution is

[20:30 - 20:35]
telling us to grow up. And as I said in

[20:32 - 20:36]
our last Chad GPT4 video, that is the

[20:35 - 20:38]
whole point. If you closely look at

[20:36 - 20:41]
nature's pattern, you would notice that

[20:38 - 20:43]
in every 1,000 years, there's a cycle

[20:41 - 20:45]
that repeats. In most cases, like 1500

[20:43 - 20:47]
or 2,000 years ago, nature practiced

[20:45 - 20:48]
natural selection in humans with new

[20:47 - 20:50]
kinds of diseases and predators to

[20:48 - 20:52]
filter out humans who cannot coordinate,

[20:50 - 20:54]
who cannot evolve, who cannot learn. And

[20:52 - 20:55]
humans eventually cracked all of it.

[20:54 - 20:57]
They cracked medicine. They cracked

[20:55 - 20:59]
architecture. They cracked electricity.

[20:57 - 21:02]
So nature's old way of filtering weaker

[20:59 - 21:04]
species got eventually outdated because

[21:02 - 21:06]
humans leveled up. In that process, a

[21:04 - 21:09]
lot of humans got under the trap of

[21:06 - 21:12]
nature. But majority survived and then

[21:09 - 21:14]
we had a stronger society, stronger than

[21:12 - 21:16]
ever. And that is how nature pushes you

[21:14 - 21:18]
to evolve. And then in the past 2050

[21:16 - 21:20]
years, nature said fine, let me just

[21:18 - 21:22]
give them good internet and sugar and

[21:20 - 21:24]
comfort and let's see who falls for

[21:22 - 21:26]
that. And humans without willpower and

[21:24 - 21:27]
discipline started getting health issues

[21:26 - 21:29]
and mental issues and they started

[21:27 - 21:31]
losing grip on their quality of lives.

[21:29 - 21:33]
Now nature has raised the stakes and

[21:31 - 21:35]
with these new tactics nature is again

[21:33 - 21:37]
checking who will evolve further and

[21:35 - 21:39]
help her take things to the next level

[21:37 - 21:41]
because think about it right like this

[21:39 - 21:43]
entire universe there is some power

[21:41 - 21:45]
which is fueling the universe and there

[21:43 - 21:47]
is some architect who has a bigger plan

[21:45 - 21:49]
and if you want to be a part of that

[21:47 - 21:51]
plan you have to level up you have to

[21:49 - 21:52]
learn and you have to be compatible

[21:51 - 21:54]
enough to be a part of the bigger

[21:52 - 21:56]
picture and I think this is the best

[21:54 - 21:59]
time to learn this is the most most

[21:56 - 22:01]
important time to actually spend enough

[21:59 - 22:03]
effort on your mental clarity, on your

[22:01 - 22:05]
physical health and keep on learning

[22:03 - 22:08]
because these tools are still young. It

[22:05 - 22:09]
is way better to learn when these tools

[22:08 - 22:11]
are young rather than waiting for them

[22:09 - 22:13]
to become so good that everything

[22:11 - 22:15]
becomes a mountain for you. The

[22:13 - 22:17]
fundamental rule here is that anything

[22:15 - 22:19]
easy will be replicable very fast. So if

[22:17 - 22:20]
you think that just learning how to use

[22:19 - 22:22]
chat GPT and learning how to use

[22:20 - 22:24]
midjourney will help you secure your

[22:22 - 22:25]
job, it doesn't work like that. Because

[22:24 - 22:27]
if you can learn something in one day,

[22:25 - 22:29]
then anybody can learn it in one day.

[22:27 - 22:31]
Your job is to learn how to do hard

[22:29 - 22:32]
things. This could be taking care of

[22:31 - 22:34]
your body, your relationships, your

[22:32 - 22:36]
communication skills, meeting more

[22:34 - 22:38]
people, traveling, reading a lot,

[22:36 - 22:40]
finding patterns, things that are not

[22:38 - 22:42]
that difficult. Things that are easy to

[22:40 - 22:45]
replicate will be replicable. Like it is

[22:42 - 22:47]
as simple as that. The ability to learn

[22:45 - 22:48]
and do hard things will be a strong and

[22:47 - 22:51]
thick mode. And I'm telling you this

[22:48 - 22:53]
very seriously. Every week I meet people

[22:51 - 22:56]
who do not have the willpower to sit and

[22:53 - 22:57]
learn something. It is extremely sad and

[22:56 - 22:59]
disheartening because I don't think this

[22:57 - 23:01]
problem existed a while back. I think

[22:59 - 23:03]
eight to nine years ago when maybe our

[23:01 - 23:04]
screen times were not so high when maybe

[23:03 - 23:06]
life was not that comfortable when you

[23:04 - 23:08]
didn't have this much of content online

[23:06 - 23:09]
people were bored and when they were

[23:08 - 23:12]
bored they were like trying out new

[23:09 - 23:14]
things new people you know getting into

[23:12 - 23:15]
like casual fights and all of those

[23:14 - 23:17]
stuff and you sort of learn like you

[23:15 - 23:19]
learn your way up you get hit and you

[23:17 - 23:21]
you take a punch but now people have put

[23:19 - 23:23]
themselves into extreme comfort.

[23:21 - 23:26]
Everybody wants to eat but nobody wants

[23:23 - 23:28]
to hunt. So I would recommend you to not

[23:26 - 23:30]
be one of those people and yeah just

[23:28 - 23:31]
improve your life. Make sure you write

[23:30 - 23:33]
your detailed feedback in the comment

[23:31 - 23:35]
section. I apologize if the ending

[23:33 - 23:38]
became slightly philosophical. It's just

[23:35 - 23:40]
my nature and it takes us a lot of

[23:38 - 23:42]
effort to actually make these videos.

[23:40 - 23:44]
It's extremely expensive to set this up.

[23:42 - 23:46]
So without your support, without your

[23:44 - 23:48]
comments, we won't be able to sustain.

[23:46 - 23:50]

[23:48 - 23:52]

even more.

Apart from the roadmap, I love the philosophical aspect. The nature part was very new but accurate.

### 3. @Vishnu.kVishnu.k-s2l9b (👍 34)
Bought the book called Inside the AI Matrix Vault for $23 thinking it was just another AI gimmick. But the way it broke down automation + ad loopholes flipped my whole mindset. Didn’t expect to learn something from a PDF but here we are, earning someones monthly wage in a few days from home…

### 4. @Rajanibadra (👍 48)
its quite shocking how only a few people know about book inside the ai matrix vault by prince marvok

### 5. @shashankdave1587 (👍 17)
This is the kind of content we need more of on the internet. Someone who feels like a family on my screen and is really pushing everyone to grow in this hard time. We need to understand and analyze what we force ourselves on, on a daily basis. Like what we see in terms of content, what we do in terms of upskilling, what we build in terms of relationships and communications, how we take care of our physical and mental health. Basically, Basics have become more important than ever. Thanks a lot Ansh ❤

> **@CuttingEdgeSchool** (👍 5): Thank you so much for the kind words Shashank!!

Crazyyy detailed informative about AI as a whole and ending it in philosophical way to give a reality check or nature evolution on humans.

### 19. @himanshinaniwal7861 (👍 0)
I think this is the best video about AI I have seen so far, he made his point so clearly, indeed a great articulation of his thoughts based on what he has learned through his experiences.. Thank you Ansh.

### 20. @ConnectMukesh (👍 0)

Thank you so much.
