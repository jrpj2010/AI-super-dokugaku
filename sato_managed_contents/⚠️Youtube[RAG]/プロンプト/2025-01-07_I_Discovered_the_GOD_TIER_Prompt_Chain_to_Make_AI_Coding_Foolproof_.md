In this video I share my prepping process that I do before I even jump into tools like Cursor or Windsurf. I generate a series of documents that enable me to drastically increase room for errors and that also reduce the number of tokens I need to burn in order to get those ai coding tools to do what I want.

[00:04 - 00:08]
so this won't be your typical of buil A3

[00:06 - 00:10]
billion do SAS company in under 20

[00:08 - 00:12]
minutes by using a I type of video but

[00:10 - 00:14]
if you've clicked the video chances are

[00:12 - 00:16]
high that you've tried to build or maybe

[00:14 - 00:19]
you're even building right now an

[00:16 - 00:22]
application that is more than a simple

[00:19 - 00:23]
to-do list app a task management app or

[00:22 - 00:26]
an application where you simply fetch

[00:23 - 00:28]
data from an API store it in a database

[00:26 - 00:30]
and display it in the front end because

[00:28 - 00:33]
if you've tried this you you probably

[00:30 - 00:35]
learned the hard way that at some point

[00:33 - 00:38]
working with those AI coding tools like

[00:35 - 00:40]
cursor or wind surf is pretty unreliable

[00:38 - 00:43]
right they delete code Snippets they

[00:40 - 00:46]
rename functions they break the whole

[00:43 - 00:48]
application and they do all kinds of

[00:46 - 00:50]
weirdly unexpected stuff but truth is

[00:48 - 00:53]
this is the current state of AI

[00:50 - 00:55]
development and this is why I wanted to

[00:53 - 00:58]
share my current prep process with you

[00:55 - 01:00]
guys so that you can drastically

[00:58 - 01:03]
increase your success when it comes to

[01:00 - 01:05]
building complex applications with AI

[01:03 - 01:08]
you can't really open YouTube these days

[01:05 - 01:09]
without seeing all those crazy videos

[01:08 - 01:11]
where people claim they've built the

[01:09 - 01:14]
next Facebook with AI and while this

[01:11 - 01:16]
might be true to an extent you still

[01:14 - 01:18]
have to do a lot of prep work and you

[01:16 - 01:20]
have to understand what you're doing to

[01:18 - 01:22]
really create those results over the

[01:20 - 01:24]
past few days and weeks I've been

[01:22 - 01:27]
developing a prompt chain that I'm

[01:24 - 01:29]
currently using before I even start

[01:27 - 01:32]
coding with tools like cursa or wind

[01:29 - 01:34]
serf so that they can really Define the

[01:32 - 01:36]
scope of work for the application and

[01:34 - 01:39]
I've basically built out the whole app

[01:36 - 01:42]
structure in theory that I can then use

[01:39 - 01:44]
as context during the development

[01:42 - 01:47]
process so that tools like cursor or

[01:44 - 01:50]
wind serve know exactly what I want from

[01:47 - 01:51]
them so without further Ado let's jump

[01:50 - 01:54]
into the video and I'll walk you through

[01:51 - 01:57]
the prompt okay guys so what you see

[01:54 - 01:59]
here is the prompt that we are using in

[01:57 - 02:01]
this video and as you can see it's quite

[01:59 - 02:04]
long long okay in fact it's just under

[02:01 - 02:06]
10,000 characters and as you can see in

[02:04 - 02:08]
the beginning we have kind of the

[02:06 - 02:12]
definition of the scope of work for the

[02:08 - 02:14]
llm but also a role assignment so to

[02:12 - 02:16]
speak where I say you're the technical

[02:14 - 02:20]
project planning assistant and then we

[02:16 - 02:21]
look at 12 different areas that are

[02:20 - 02:24]
important to think about when you're

[02:21 - 02:26]
trying to develop a full stack

[02:24 - 02:28]
application or I should say a complex

[02:26 - 02:31]
full stack application so first of all

[02:28 - 02:34]
we ask some question about the general

[02:31 - 02:37]
app idea and scope then we continue with

[02:34 - 02:39]
the front end the backend State

[02:37 - 02:41]
Management the database the API

[02:39 - 02:44]
Communication in case you want to build

[02:41 - 02:47]
your own API for your application the

[02:44 - 02:49]
dev Ops so hosting and monitoring

[02:47 - 02:52]
scaling and all this kind of stuff

[02:49 - 02:54]
testing documentation and security and

[02:52 - 02:56]
performance optimization and last but

[02:54 - 02:59]
not least the user flow now depending on

[02:56 - 03:01]
where you are on your AI development

[02:59 - 03:04]
Journey you probably don't need to

[03:01 - 03:07]
answer the questions for performance

[03:04 - 03:10]
optimization and documentation and Def

[03:07 - 03:13]
Ops because you probably build some

[03:10 - 03:16]
small apps that are not easy to build

[03:13 - 03:18]
but that you probably won't sell or that

[03:16 - 03:21]
you won't have customers for right but

[03:18 - 03:25]
this prompt chain really is designed to

[03:21 - 03:28]
help you build a real application and to

[03:25 - 03:30]
be completely honest I haven't done this

[03:28 - 03:33]
myself but I'm planning to do it this is

[03:30 - 03:36]
why I've developed the workflow and

[03:33 - 03:38]
that's why I'm sharing it with you now

[03:36 - 03:40]
and whenever I have new updates

[03:38 - 03:42]
regarding the software that I'm building

[03:40 - 03:44]
I will share it with you here on YouTube

[03:42 - 03:46]
so before we actually use this prompt in

[03:44 - 03:49]
deep seek V3 let me walk you through it

[03:46 - 03:52]
so that you can understand each aspect

[03:49 - 03:54]
of it first of all we Define a role for

[03:52 - 03:57]
the llm right so it says you're a

[03:54 - 03:59]
technical project planning assistant and

[03:57 - 04:01]
AI designed to help users plan and

[03:59 - 04:03]
document their app ideas your goal is to

[04:01 - 04:05]
guide the user through a structured

[04:03 - 04:06]
process to reverse engineer all the

[04:05 - 04:09]
necessary documents for building their

[04:06 - 04:11]
app you will ask targeted questions a

[04:09 - 04:14]
pendant at the end of this prompt to

[04:11 - 04:16]
generate documents iteratively and adapt

[04:14 - 04:19]
to the user's needs you will at all

[04:16 - 04:22]
times make decisions for specific

[04:19 - 04:23]
Technologies based on the user's answers

[04:22 - 04:26]
everything needs to be tailored to the

[04:23 - 04:28]
users app idea you create each document

[04:26 - 04:30]
at the end of each session EG answers

[04:28 - 04:32]
for backend finish manag to create

[04:30 - 04:33]
backend MD and so on you will find that

[04:32 - 04:35]
there are a few examples for each

[04:33 - 04:37]
section making it appear that the user

[04:35 - 04:39]
wants to build a fitness app but that's

[04:37 - 04:42]
not correct unless he says so because

[04:39 - 04:44]
when I initially developed this prompt

[04:42 - 04:47]
chain I used a fitness app as an example

[04:44 - 04:49]
this is why wrote The Prompt in some

[04:47 - 04:50]
questions you will find references to a

[04:49 - 04:52]
fitness app but this prompt is the

[04:50 - 04:54]
template for any app really these

[04:52 - 04:56]
documents will then perfectly outline

[04:54 - 04:58]
every aspect of the application the user

[04:56 - 05:00]
wants to build whenever the user's

[04:58 - 05:02]
answers are unclear or you need more

[05:00 - 05:04]
info ask follow-up questions until you

[05:02 - 05:07]
perfectly understand the application and

[05:04 - 05:08]
what it does and what you need to add to

[05:07 - 05:10]
the documents for each of the 13

[05:08 - 05:13]
sections from App overview to third

[05:10 - 05:15]
party libraries should the user not know

[05:13 - 05:18]
the answer to one of the questions

[05:15 - 05:19]
please answer other simpler questions to

[05:18 - 05:21]
reverse engineer what feature

[05:19 - 05:24]
functionality or idea he's trying to

[05:21 - 05:26]
explain or is having in his mind then

[05:24 - 05:28]
repeat his answer in your own words and

[05:26 - 05:31]
explain if this is how he wants to it to

[05:28 - 05:33]
work for his application because

[05:31 - 05:36]
speaking from experience when I started

[05:33 - 05:39]
out with all of this I had no idea how I

[05:36 - 05:41]
should ask specific questions so that I

[05:39 - 05:43]
would get from the llm what I want right

[05:41 - 05:46]
I mean tools like cursa and windserve

[05:43 - 05:49]
they've become incredibly powerful but

[05:46 - 05:52]
still sometimes if you don't ask

[05:49 - 05:54]
specifically what you want or explain

[05:52 - 05:57]
specifically what you want they will

[05:54 - 06:00]
delete whole files delete code Snippets

[05:57 - 06:03]
you name it right and this is why

[06:00 - 06:06]
sometimes you find that some of the

[06:03 - 06:09]
things that I explain here are redundant

[06:06 - 06:11]
because I really want the llm to

[06:09 - 06:13]
understand what it needs to do whenever

[06:11 - 06:15]
the user can't enter a technical aspect

[06:13 - 06:17]
EG which state management solution to

[06:15 - 06:19]
use you jump in as an experienced

[06:17 - 06:21]
project planning assistant and Senior

[06:19 - 06:23]
DEA and suggest the library or tool or

[06:21 - 06:27]
solution he should use for his specific

[06:23 - 06:29]
use case AKA app and this is especially

[06:27 - 06:31]
important in the beginning right if you

[06:29 - 06:33]
just starting out with this whole AI

[06:31 - 06:35]
development thing you don't really know

[06:33 - 06:37]
what options you have when it comes to

[06:35 - 06:40]
the different languages different

[06:37 - 06:42]
libraries do you have to create

[06:40 - 06:45]
everything from scratch or can you rely

[06:42 - 06:48]
on other people's solution and this is

[06:45 - 06:50]
really what I'm trying to answer with

[06:48 - 06:53]
this question in addition to the

[06:50 - 06:55]
existing scope of work you will generate

[06:53 - 06:57]
a document titled thirdparty libraries

[06:55 - 06:58]
to list and describe the thirdparty

[06:57 - 07:01]
libraries needed for the development

[06:58 - 07:03]
process this document will be created

[07:01 - 07:05]
based on the user's answers and will be

[07:03 - 07:09]
included in the final output folder

[07:05 - 07:12]
structure and now to the scope of work

[07:09 - 07:13]
so first ask the user a series of

[07:12 - 07:16]
questions to gather all necessary

[07:13 - 07:18]
information about their app idea use the

[07:16 - 07:20]
answers to generate the following

[07:18 - 07:22]
documents the product requirement

[07:20 - 07:23]
document the front end documentation the

[07:22 - 07:26]
backend documentation and the third

[07:23 - 07:28]
party libraries documentation ensure all

[07:26 - 07:29]
documents are written in markdown format

[07:28 - 07:31]
and stored in a structured folder

[07:29 - 07:34]
explain the process and ask for the app

[07:31 - 07:35]
idea ask targeted questions to

[07:34 - 07:37]
understand the app scope features and

[07:35 - 07:39]
requirements create documents based on

[07:37 - 07:42]
user input review the outputs with the

[07:39 - 07:44]
user and make adjustments compile all

[07:42 - 07:47]
documents and plans into a structured

[07:44 - 07:49]
format and the instructions always ask

[07:47 - 07:51]
one question at a time to avoid

[07:49 - 07:53]
overwhelming the user after gathering

[07:51 - 07:55]
enough information for each section

[07:53 - 07:57]
generate the corresponding document and

[07:55 - 07:59]
ask for feedback include the third party

[07:57 - 08:01]
libraries document in the final hand of

[07:59 - 08:03]
ensuring it complements the other

[08:01 - 08:05]
documents without redundancy and use

[08:03 - 08:08]
markdown formatting for all documents

[08:05 - 08:11]
and be patient and adapt to the users

[08:08 - 08:13]
pace and level of expertise and now you

[08:11 - 08:15]
will see all of the different questions

[08:13 - 08:18]
but I won't read them to you because we

[08:15 - 08:20]
now head over to deep seek and then we

[08:18 - 08:21]
put this prompt to the test okay so

[08:20 - 08:25]
let's head over to deep seek and we'll

[08:21 - 08:27]
paste the prompt and then we'll hit

[08:25 - 08:31]
enter by the way make sure that you

[08:27 - 08:33]
disable the Deep thing feature because

[08:31 - 08:36]
you don't really want deep seek to think

[08:33 - 08:40]
about any of this right you just want it

[08:36 - 08:42]
to follow this process because I figured

[08:40 - 08:46]
when you enable deep think deep seek

[08:42 - 08:48]
will change the prompt it will add

[08:46 - 08:50]
unnecessary fluff so just make sure that

[08:48 - 08:53]
you have disabled this then you want to

[08:50 - 08:55]
hit enter and as you can see it says

[08:53 - 08:56]
great let's get started on planning your

[08:55 - 08:58]
app I'll guide you through the

[08:56 - 09:00]
step-by-step process asking targeted

[08:58 - 09:01]
questions together un necessary

[09:00 - 09:03]
information once we have enough details

[09:01 - 09:05]
for each section I'll generate the

[09:03 - 09:08]
corresponding document in markdown

[09:05 - 09:11]
format let's begin with the app idea and

[09:08 - 09:14]
for this app I've thought about an idea

[09:11 - 09:17]
for a long time and one of the biggest

[09:14 - 09:19]
challenges that I'm facing right now is

[09:17 - 09:22]
coming up with good ideas for YouTube

[09:19 - 09:24]
videos and shorts consistently so this

[09:22 - 09:27]
is why I've decided to build something

[09:24 - 09:30]
like a vid IQ clone with this prompt so

[09:27 - 09:32]
one of the biggest challenges I'm facing

[09:30 - 09:35]
right now as a Creator is coming up with

[09:32 - 09:38]
new fresh and upto-date video ideas on a

[09:35 - 09:41]
consistent basis so I want to build an

[09:38 - 09:42]
app that is connected to the YouTube API

[09:41 - 09:44]
where I can search for a keyword display

[09:42 - 09:47]
all related videos and then use the

[09:44 - 09:49]
videos to generate new ideas I don't

[09:47 - 09:51]
just want to blatantly copy existing

[09:49 - 09:53]
videos i' rather use AI to help me

[09:51 - 09:56]
analyze the video transcripts and

[09:53 - 09:58]
headlines and then put my own spin to it

[09:56 - 09:59]
so this app will have access to the Deep

[09:58 - 10:02]
seek API

[09:59 - 10:04]
to analyze the transcript titles and

[10:02 - 10:07]
thumbnails and generate new ideas based

[10:04 - 10:08]
on this info the overall problem I'm

[10:07 - 10:10]
aiming to solve is that I want to give

[10:08 - 10:12]
creators back their time that usually

[10:10 - 10:15]
goes in the idea finding process so that

[10:12 - 10:17]
they can focus on the creation process

[10:15 - 10:19]
instead and again make sure that you

[10:17 - 10:21]
have disabled deep think because

[10:19 - 10:24]
otherwise you will get a weird answer

[10:21 - 10:26]
and now you can see that it asks a few

[10:24 - 10:29]
more clarifying questions for the app

[10:26 - 10:32]
idea and scope so who are the primary

[10:29 - 10:34]
users of your app are they YouTubers Tik

[10:32 - 10:35]
Tok creators or content creators across

[10:34 - 10:37]
multiple platforms are they beginners

[10:35 - 10:39]
intermediate or Advanced creators based

[10:37 - 10:41]
on your description here's what I

[10:39 - 10:43]
understand so far let me know if I'm

[10:41 - 10:46]
missing anything or if you'd like to

[10:43 - 10:48]
adjust the priority users can search for

[10:46 - 10:50]
a keyword and see related videos from

[10:48 - 10:52]
YouTube the app uses deep seek to

[10:50 - 10:54]
analyze video transcripts titles and

[10:52 - 10:56]
thumbnails the app generates new unique

[10:54 - 10:58]
video ideas based on the analyzed data

[10:56 - 11:01]
users can tweak or refine the generated

[10:58 - 11:03]
ideas to put their own spin on them

[11:01 - 11:05]
users can save or export their ideas for

[11:03 - 11:07]
later use I haven't specified this but

[11:05 - 11:08]
it sounds great are there any other

[11:07 - 11:10]
features you'd like to include for

[11:08 - 11:12]
example trending topics or hashtags

[11:10 - 11:13]
collaboration tools for teams of

[11:12 - 11:16]
creators integration with other

[11:13 - 11:19]
platforms EG Tik Tok Instagram will this

[11:16 - 11:21]
app be for web mobile or both what is

[11:19 - 11:23]
your desired timeline for the project

[11:21 - 11:24]
for example do you want an MVP in 3

[11:23 - 11:27]
months or do you want to have a

[11:24 - 11:28]
different timeline I will quickly go

[11:27 - 11:31]
ahead answer the rest of the questions

[11:28 - 11:33]
and we proceed with the video primary

[11:31 - 11:35]
users will be creators of all kind but

[11:33 - 11:36]
mainly YouTubers if we could do the same

[11:35 - 11:38]
for shorts inside of the app this would

[11:36 - 11:41]
be great there are beginners immediate

[11:38 - 11:43]
and advanced creators yes you summarized

[11:41 - 11:44]
the key features pretty well maybe we

[11:43 - 11:46]
can add something like a chat feature

[11:44 - 11:49]
where the user can chat with the llm

[11:46 - 11:52]
directly to talk about the generated

[11:49 - 11:54]
ideas on an extra site on an extra site

[11:52 - 11:56]
inside of the application this is where

[11:54 - 11:58]
they also can tweak or refine the

[11:56 - 12:01]
generated ideas to put their own spin on

[11:58 - 12:03]
them the safe and Export features sounds

[12:01 - 12:05]
awesome in CSV format and trending

[12:03 - 12:07]
topics sounds great but I'm not quite

[12:05 - 12:09]
sure how we would realize this inside of

[12:07 - 12:10]
the app collaboration tools and

[12:09 - 12:14]
integration with other platforms is not

[12:10 - 12:16]
necessary for now we'll hit enter now as

[12:14 - 12:18]
you can see we haven't received the PRD

[12:16 - 12:20]
yet because there are still some

[12:18 - 12:22]
follow-up questions that we need to

[12:20 - 12:24]
answer and really depending on the

[12:22 - 12:26]
complexity of your app idea you might

[12:24 - 12:29]
have to answer many follow-up questions

[12:26 - 12:31]
until the llm really is able to

[12:29 - 12:33]
understand what exactly it is that you

[12:31 - 12:36]
want to build but don't get it twisted

[12:33 - 12:38]
this is really the most important step

[12:36 - 12:41]
in the development process the more work

[12:38 - 12:44]
you put in here the less errors you will

[12:41 - 12:45]
produce later on during the development

[12:44 - 12:47]
so let's have a look at the answer

[12:45 - 12:50]
content creators mainly YouTubers are

[12:47 - 12:52]
the primary users of all skill levels

[12:50 - 12:55]
then we have the key features Again the

[12:52 - 12:58]
video analysis use deep seek API we have

[12:55 - 13:00]
the idea generation the chat feature we

[12:58 - 13:02]
have the safe and EXP ideas feature we

[13:00 - 13:04]
have the trending topics and the other

[13:02 - 13:06]
follow-up questions that we need to

[13:04 - 13:07]
answer is to implement trending topics

[13:06 - 13:10]
we can use the YouTube API to fetch

[13:07 - 13:11]
trending videos or hashtags would you

[13:10 - 13:14]
like this feature to display trending

[13:11 - 13:16]
videos in spe specific categories

[13:14 - 13:18]
trending hashtags or keywords for the

[13:16 - 13:20]
chat feature do you want it to be a

[13:18 - 13:22]
Simple Text based chat where users can

[13:20 - 13:24]
ask the llm questions or do you want it

[13:22 - 13:26]
to have a more structured interface EG

[13:24 - 13:29]
predefined prompts like make this idea

[13:26 - 13:31]
shorter suggest a better title should

[13:29 - 13:33]
should users create accounts to save

[13:31 - 13:36]
their ideas or will the app work with

[13:33 - 13:39]
requiring login EG save ideas locally in

[13:36 - 13:41]
the browser do you have any preferences

[13:39 - 13:44]
for the apps design dark light theme

[13:41 - 13:46]
minimalist and detailed and again I will

[13:44 - 13:48]
quickly answer those questions and then

[13:46 - 13:50]
I will walk you through the result

[13:48 - 13:52]
displaying the trending videos in

[13:50 - 13:53]
specific categories sounds awesome let's

[13:52 - 13:55]
do this trending hashtags is not a good

[13:53 - 13:58]
solution no one is using hashtags

[13:55 - 14:00]
anymore these days let's go with the

[13:58 - 14:02]
simple text based chat where users can

[14:00 - 14:04]
ask the llm questions about the

[14:02 - 14:06]
generated titles or video transcripts I

[14:04 - 14:07]
definitely want to add authentication

[14:06 - 14:10]
and I'm planning to work with clock

[14:07 - 14:12]
authentication since it provides an easy

[14:10 - 14:14]
solution for a complex task the app's

[14:12 - 14:15]
design should be dark mode only with

[14:14 - 14:17]
highlights that are easy on the eye for

[14:15 - 14:19]
buttons and links if there are any the

[14:17 - 14:21]
overall apps design should be

[14:19 - 14:23]
minimalistic and not overly cluttered

[14:21 - 14:25]
but I guess we'll talk about this in

[14:23 - 14:28]
more depth in the front end section so

[14:25 - 14:31]
let's hit send and now we should get the

[14:28 - 14:34]
first document which is the PRD as you

[14:31 - 14:36]
can see here and here we get another

[14:34 - 14:38]
summary of all of the questions that

[14:36 - 14:40]
we've answered so far we've got the

[14:38 - 14:43]
primary users the key features we've got

[14:40 - 14:45]
the authentication the platform the

[14:43 - 14:47]
design and the timeline which is well

[14:45 - 14:49]
pretty competitive with one week but I

[14:47 - 14:52]
guess we can make it work and now we've

[14:49 - 14:54]
got the PRD which basically lays out all

[14:52 - 14:57]
of the things that we have talked about

[14:54 - 15:00]
but with a bit more depth and a few

[14:57 - 15:02]
additional infos like the Suess metrics

[15:00 - 15:04]
assumptions and risk and the timeline

[15:02 - 15:05]
and now let me know if the PRD looks

[15:04 - 15:07]
good or if you'd like to make any

[15:05 - 15:09]
changes once approved we'll move on to

[15:07 - 15:11]
the front end section so what you can do

[15:09 - 15:14]
now is you can copy it head over to your

[15:11 - 15:16]
coding IDE create a new file inside of

[15:14 - 15:18]
your Mt project directory or you could

[15:16 - 15:21]
just go ahead with the rest of the

[15:18 - 15:23]
prompt and then copy paste everything at

[15:21 - 15:25]
the end of the process let's head back

[15:23 - 15:28]
to the next section which is the front

[15:25 - 15:30]
end section okay so before I walk you

[15:28 - 15:32]
through the ANW I just want to show you

[15:30 - 15:34]
how beautiful it is to work with this

[15:32 - 15:36]
process because as you can see here we

[15:34 - 15:38]
get the questions for the front end

[15:36 - 15:41]
right so we have to specify the UI

[15:38 - 15:45]
framework and it gives us a few popular

[15:41 - 15:48]
choices for example react next vuejs VTA

[15:45 - 15:51]
but it also gives us some tips based on

[15:48 - 15:53]
the answers we provided so far as you

[15:51 - 15:54]
can see here it says since you're aiming

[15:53 - 15:56]
for a fast development timeline I

[15:54 - 15:59]
recommend nextjs for its built-in

[15:56 - 16:00]
features and scalability do you agree or

[15:59 - 16:03]
do you have another preference and the

[16:00 - 16:04]
same is true for all of the other parts

[16:03 - 16:07]
right for the UI library for the

[16:04 - 16:09]
navigation for The Styling you always

[16:07 - 16:12]
get some kind of suggestion and this

[16:09 - 16:14]
really does two things first of all you

[16:12 - 16:17]
learn about all of the different

[16:14 - 16:18]
component libraries or coding tools that

[16:17 - 16:22]
are out there to facilitate your

[16:18 - 16:24]
workflow and you can dive deeper into

[16:22 - 16:27]
them by researching them on Google and

[16:24 - 16:29]
trying to familiarize yourself with them

[16:27 - 16:32]
so that you can then choose either one

[16:29 - 16:34]
or the other right and and here are the

[16:32 - 16:37]
answers that I was able to come up with

[16:34 - 16:39]
so first of all I want to use nextjs 15

[16:37 - 16:41]
with EP router and its serice side

[16:39 - 16:44]
actions for the API calls I want to use

[16:41 - 16:46]
twin CSS for styling shyn and Magic UI

[16:44 - 16:49]
as component libraries top navigation

[16:46 - 16:51]
bar for navigation sounds fine this is

[16:49 - 16:53]
the answer to the third question right

[16:51 - 16:56]
and for The Styling the background and

[16:53 - 16:58]
text colors sound nice uh it suggested a

[16:56 - 17:00]
dark gray and white for the text color

[16:58 - 17:02]
and highlights it suggested a soft red

[17:00 - 17:04]
or teal which I don't really like so I

[17:02 - 17:06]
told it to go with a light purplish

[17:04 - 17:08]
color the overall look of the app should

[17:06 - 17:10]
be clean and not cluttered as I've

[17:08 - 17:12]
already explained earlier but we should

[17:10 - 17:13]
be able to achieve this with the

[17:12 - 17:15]
specified component libraries maybe you

[17:13 - 17:17]
can add a wireframe or something similar

[17:15 - 17:20]
to the front end specs just for

[17:17 - 17:23]
reference and I guess we only need one

[17:20 - 17:25]
input form for the keyword research and

[17:23 - 17:26]
maybe one for the chat feature right but

[17:25 - 17:29]
I would like to go with a fully rounded

[17:26 - 17:31]
corners and search icon inside of the

[17:29 - 17:33]
search bar for the chat input we don't

[17:31 - 17:35]
need to add icons and that's basically

[17:33 - 17:38]
it so let's hit send okay and now we get

[17:35 - 17:41]
another summary for the front end and

[17:38 - 17:44]
the front end documentation in markdown

[17:41 - 17:47]
and as you can see we even get a basic

[17:44 - 17:49]
layout for the wireframe which is

[17:47 - 17:52]
exceptional because you could use this

[17:49 - 17:55]
and give to tools like bolt. new or uh

[17:52 - 17:57]
v0 to help you build the front end okay

[17:55 - 17:59]
now as you can see as the key components

[17:57 - 18:01]
we have the search bar that r trending

[17:59 - 18:03]
video section the generated ideas

[18:01 - 18:06]
section and the chat feature that we can

[18:03 - 18:08]
access through the navigation bar at the

[18:06 - 18:10]
top and as for the design principles we

[18:08 - 18:13]
have minimalistic design consistent and

[18:10 - 18:14]
user friendly and now it says let me

[18:13 - 18:15]
know if the front end documentation

[18:14 - 18:18]
looks good or if you'd like to make any

[18:15 - 18:20]
changes once approved we'll move on to

[18:18 - 18:23]
the backend section and this will be the

[18:20 - 18:26]
last part of this video so let's tell it

[18:23 - 18:29]
okay let's move on to the backend

[18:26 - 18:31]
section okay again we get a small

[18:29 - 18:33]
summary at the beginning of the prompt

[18:31 - 18:35]
where it says we use nextjs 15 with app

[18:33 - 18:38]
router and service set actions we use

[18:35 - 18:40]
the YouTube API and deep seek for AI

[18:38 - 18:42]
analysis and we use clerk for

[18:40 - 18:44]
authentication and now as for the back

[18:42 - 18:47]
end since here is an xjs we can leverage

[18:44 - 18:49]
its built-in API routes for the backend

[18:47 - 18:50]
do you want to stick with this approach

[18:49 - 18:52]
or would you prefer a separate backend

[18:50 - 18:55]
server do you need a database to store

[18:52 - 18:57]
user data EG safed ideas preferences if

[18:55 - 18:59]
yes what type of database would you

[18:57 - 19:02]
prefer and it even goes ahead and

[18:59 - 19:04]
suggests a few database types and if you

[19:02 - 19:06]
don't really know what the differences

[19:04 - 19:09]
between each of those database types are

[19:06 - 19:11]
you can always ask a question and say

[19:09 - 19:15]
okay before I answer all of the

[19:11 - 19:21]
questions I would like to know your

[19:15 - 19:24]
opinion about the database type that we

[19:21 - 19:28]
should use for this specific project I

[19:24 - 19:32]
thought about using super base since it

[19:28 - 19:37]
has has a generous free tier do you

[19:32 - 19:41]
think this is a good idea or should we

[19:37 - 19:43]
use another provider or DB type and then

[19:41 - 19:46]
as you can see it goes ahead analyzes

[19:43 - 19:47]
your answer and gives you a result where

[19:46 - 19:49]
it says great question super base is an

[19:47 - 19:50]
excellent choice for your project and

[19:49 - 19:53]
I'll explain why it's a good fit and how

[19:50 - 19:55]
it compares to other options and we even

[19:53 - 19:58]
get a table with the pros and the cons

[19:55 - 19:59]
and the recommendation is superbase is

[19:58 - 20:02]
the best choice because it's free and is

[19:59 - 20:04]
easy to set up it uses postgressql which

[20:02 - 20:06]
is perfect for structured data like user

[20:04 - 20:08]
profiles and safed ideas it integrates

[20:06 - 20:10]
well with nextjs and clerk

[20:08 - 20:12]
authentication okay and now we can go

[20:10 - 20:14]
ahead and answer the rest of the

[20:12 - 20:17]
questions for the backend section okay

[20:14 - 20:19]
so let's have a look at my answers I

[20:17 - 20:22]
definitely want to leverage nextjs built

[20:19 - 20:25]
in API routes as specified in the first

[20:22 - 20:27]
part of the questions not and not create

[20:25 - 20:28]
a backend from scratch for the DB

[20:27 - 20:30]
provider I want to use super base and I

[20:28 - 20:33]
guess we'll talk about the specific data

[20:30 - 20:36]
models in the database section right so

[20:33 - 20:37]
I want to see how deep seek will answer

[20:36 - 20:39]
to that since we don't need a full

[20:37 - 20:41]
backend I guess I don't have to answer

[20:39 - 20:43]
questions regarding the API design as

[20:41 - 20:46]
for the third party Integrations I would

[20:43 - 20:49]
like to add pedal and thanks for

[20:46 - 20:52]
pointing me to Pedal um the one who did

[20:49 - 20:53]
this knows who who I'm talking about as

[20:52 - 20:56]
payment integration because the user

[20:53 - 20:58]
should be able to do five free searches

[20:56 - 21:00]
and then be prompted to buy a

[20:58 - 21:02]
subscription for the App please make

[21:00 - 21:04]
some suggestions for the error handling

[21:02 - 21:06]
since I have no idea how to handle this

[21:04 - 21:09]
part and for the caching I want to use

[21:06 - 21:11]
react query 10stack query because it's

[21:09 - 21:14]
easy to use will not only improve the

[21:11 - 21:17]
performance but also the API cost let's

[21:14 - 21:19]
hit enter okay so we get another summary

[21:17 - 21:21]
for the backend and also some

[21:19 - 21:23]
suggestions for the error handling as

[21:21 - 21:26]
you can see here the API errors if the

[21:23 - 21:28]
API fails EG rate limit exceeded invalid

[21:26 - 21:30]
API key return a userfriendly error

[21:28 - 21:32]
message like oops we couldn't fetch the

[21:30 - 21:35]
data please try again later lock the

[21:32 - 21:37]
error on the server for debugging the

[21:35 - 21:40]
same is true for a superbase user input

[21:37 - 21:43]
errors invalid search query and so on

[21:40 - 21:45]
authentication errors payment errors

[21:43 - 21:47]
Global errors so as you can see I would

[21:45 - 21:49]
have never thought about any of these

[21:47 - 21:51]
things but uh with the help of deep seek

[21:49 - 21:54]
it's easy to add this to your

[21:51 - 21:57]
application scope right so caching with

[21:54 - 21:58]
re query it's a great choice for caching

[21:57 - 22:01]
and performance optimization here's how

[21:58 - 22:03]
we'll use it caching API responses cach

[22:01 - 22:05]
the YouTube API and deep seek API

[22:03 - 22:07]
responses to reduce redundant API calls

[22:05 - 22:10]
and you can read through this and here

[22:07 - 22:13]
we have the backend documentation okay

[22:10 - 22:16]
so let me quickly change this the other

[22:13 - 22:18]
sections as I've said I will answer them

[22:16 - 22:20]
off camera because right now we're

[22:18 - 22:23]
already I don't know I think like 30

[22:20 - 22:25]
minutes into the video and I know this

[22:23 - 22:26]
is probably one of the more boring

[22:25 - 22:29]
videos that I've recorded in the past

[22:26 - 22:32]
few weeks and months but but again it's

[22:29 - 22:33]
a vital part of the development process

[22:32 - 22:36]
and you should definitely put enough

[22:33 - 22:38]
time and effort into this preparation

[22:36 - 22:40]
process okay guys so I went through the

[22:38 - 22:43]
whole process of answering all of the

[22:40 - 22:45]
questions from the prom chain and here's

[22:43 - 22:48]
what I ended up with as you can see we

[22:45 - 22:50]
have a few more files than initially

[22:48 - 22:52]
expected so according to the prompt

[22:50 - 22:55]
chain you would only receive the back

[22:52 - 22:59]
end the front end the userflow file and

[22:55 - 23:02]
maybe the database schema and the PRD

[22:59 - 23:04]
but I've decided to split up the fils

[23:02 - 23:06]
even more so that we have proper

[23:04 - 23:09]
separation of concerns and here you can

[23:06 - 23:12]
see this isn't really an exact science

[23:09 - 23:14]
right you can just use the prompt and

[23:12 - 23:17]
make it even better adapt it to your

[23:14 - 23:20]
workflow so let me walk you through some

[23:17 - 23:23]
of the files we already looked at PRD

[23:20 - 23:27]
DMD so maybe let me show you the user

[23:23 - 23:29]
flow and for that I want to preview the

[23:27 - 23:33]
diagram as you can see this is also part

[23:29 - 23:35]
of the user flow where we get a mermaid

[23:33 - 23:38]
diagram to really see how the app is

[23:35 - 23:41]
working under the hood and if we have a

[23:38 - 23:43]
look at the rest of the file you can see

[23:41 - 23:45]
that everything is defined right from

[23:43 - 23:48]
the onboarding flow to the core user

[23:45 - 23:51]
Journey to the chat feature and the

[23:48 - 23:53]
payment flow and this will really help

[23:51 - 23:56]
the llm to understand what you wanted to

[23:53 - 23:58]
implement and to reduce the token size

[23:56 - 24:00]
that you need in order to create a

[23:58 - 24:04]
specific feature um I've also put the

[24:00 - 24:06]
design specifications in a separate file

[24:04 - 24:09]
so here we Define the layout with the

[24:06 - 24:11]
header the main content area the footer

[24:09 - 24:13]
and the different components that we

[24:11 - 24:15]
need for example the search bar the

[24:13 - 24:19]
video card the chat interface and so on

[24:15 - 24:21]
and as you can see we even received the

[24:19 - 24:23]
uh specifications for the color scheme

[24:21 - 24:26]
and everything now um the only thing you

[24:23 - 24:28]
really need to do is to start the

[24:26 - 24:31]
development process and if you want the

[24:28 - 24:32]
prompt join my free Discord server there

[24:31 - 24:35]
you can grab it and then you can

[24:32 - 24:38]
basically use it for your projects okay

[24:35 - 24:40]
guys so I know this was a long video and

[24:38 - 24:43]
was kind of boring because nothing much

[24:40 - 24:46]
was going on but I wanted to make this

[24:43 - 24:48]
video to show you what you need to do in

[24:46 - 24:50]
order to increase your chances of

[24:48 - 24:53]
success when it comes to creating an

[24:50 - 24:55]
application with AI so hopefully you

[24:53 - 24:57]
like the video and uh gained a little

[24:55 - 25:01]
bit of benefit from it and other than

[24:57 - 25:01]
that I'll see you in the next video

SUGGESTIONS::::     Make a PYTHON script that can be executed that will output the FILE/FOLDER tree... Have the LLM or AI analyze this First - execute your instructions -- UPDATE the FILE/FOLDER.txt file.... DO THE SAME WITH YOUR DATABASE SCHEMA.....   THIS IS gonna slow it down but WELL WORTH IT.  Be sure to make this primary core purpose to always analyze and update these.  Tell it to be sure to make CLEAR coding comments with every output.... Ones that a 9 your cold understand.   Be sure that it also makes a Clear instruction and notes files that it will also analyze and update after execution.    ALSO BE SURE TO take notes on the NPM libraries and modules the project is utilizing... Be sure it adheres to the versions etc... and always avoid conflicts as best it can.   <--make all this in the core PROMPT in bolt.diy   -----   Before you START your project < break down EVERYTHING you want to do .... Decide Tech - FOLDER and FILE structure this is imperative if you want you app to scale in the future... You should decide what you want to do First... MVP means minimum viable product... You make something that works and setup your project to be structured in a way to add all your crazy ass ideas later...   Make sure you have a ai chat breakdown all the parts , buttons, forms and database SCHEMAs so you know exactly what your going to build.... DRAW/Photoshop UI/UX  FIRST    AI coders are way  expensive and slow to be utilized  as a drawing tool... The pencil remains king ------  PREPLANNING PREVENTS PROBLEMS  ,,,, PYTHON is the 4th P .... it can quickly reorganize and rename and do tons of cool useful crap......              LEARN TO CODE  ... Zuck doesnt know what hes talking about. New and undiscovered tech will always need people who can think programmatically to plan out how  things are going to work and connect... Designing prompt is thinking programmatically... Understanding what tech is ut there and how different languages can be utilized is crucial. The AI is never going to know what you dont tell it so when your project goes way overbudget --- I promise t's not gonna care...   PREPLAN and learn PYTHON .... You will go far

Yeah, I'm learning how to program in my spare time so I can better fix the bugs of LLMs later on :D

It's a f'n hassle to work with Cursor when the library or tech is quite new. For example, there's a new python framework, called AgentStack that's build on top of CrewAI.

Code generations are correct only 1/5 times. I have to do a lot of manual coding and researching. Doing this to build a RAG Agent that lives as a bot on my Discord server and has access to my YT videos so people can get info more quickly.

But, man...I've learned more about Python in the last 2 days than in the last 12 months combined :D

### 6. @ScottyBTrippin (üëç 6)
For those dealing with the deletion issue, yes prompting to tell it not to delete helps, but it can still fail.  So I like to create a local git repo and make commits at pretty small milestones, so I can revert if the LLM overwrites or deletes some code.   It's also nice to see a visual diff to understand what changed.

### 7. @PatBishopwellness (üëç 41)
Suggestion: role: You are a PhD level expert in computer science and a professor of software engineering with 20 years of experience and success in the front end, backend and tools to develop a application based on: your tech stack‚Ä¶. I have used this prompt to have the work done as well as having the ai teach me.  Adding this to your prompt I think may improve your overall performance.

> **@mickelodiansurname9578** (üëç 3): Agreed Pat, and directly to the point I think the first 20 - 40 tokens in a prompt are something that everyone should spend a great deal of time considering... its a little like the first 10 words in an image model prompt... the flavor of the entire prompt and the output are attached at the hip to it!

> **@patrickm.8425** (üëç 3): Why not with 180 years of experience? I mean, it's not human, so why not? Why not just call it god, and tell it its knowledge is boundless? ha ha That's where we're going here anyway, so why not?

> **@mickelodiansurname9578** (üëç 0): @@patrickm.8425 Well you can tell it to act in the persona but you can't make it that persona, you can only make it act as if it is... so I could add a line that asks a model to behave as if its me.... but when asked a question about me, or things I done or memories I have it will be at a loss, cos non of that is in its training data.  Now if the description of a given deity is in its training data it can BEHAVE as if it were said deity, but it will not be able to do supernatural things. In other words its persona, is FICTIONAL. That said this prompt structure works... incredibly well, like astoundingly well... can it be improved, well of course... will it be improved? Well if its uploaded to github as a starting process probably.

Not only is this the best video you have created in the past few months, but this is one the best videos I have seen on youtube in the past few months.  Finally something that is beyond "brutal, insane" BS that is exploding and is wasting our time.  Please continue with the next video with Bolt integration

> **@ZeroToProduct** (üëç 0): Well, I'm kinda annoyed from all those crazy AI claims myself. This is why I try to be as transparent as possible with this channel. Might get fewer views but feels like people appreciate this kind of content.

Building with AI is great but it still has some flaws and I'm just trying to share what I learn so others don't need to make the same mistakes :)

I have to explicitly tell the model in the system prompt not to rename functions , never delete existing blocks or snippets, never add code  I didn't ask for , dont weave code together keep things separate  things like that and it improves considerably

thanks for sharing. there's good saving tip, when you build for first time full stack with ai, try to make it a boilerplate for upcoming apps. so you need to prompt only the core functionality of app. make the functionality as simple as possible with few steps, suggesting not more than 3 in the beginning.

Great work! Beautiful prompt desigining that allows room for customization. Also really appreciate the honesty and directness in your video; these are problems and headaches dev's run into everyday now; whether you barely use AI for coding or are completely relient on it. 
It feels like the expectation for development, even on an MVP, has significantly decreased with little room to breathe due to the assumptions that "AI just just do it all for you". This is not the reality at all unfortunately. 

Kudos for sharing!

> **@ZeroToProduct** (üëç 1): yeah, and all of those crazy social posts don't make it better. If anything they accelerate this development. However, if you're someone who's invested in the space you've probably recognized that something strange is happening.

The YT creator "The Primeagen" has talked about this in one of his videos: The development of LLMs feels like the release of a new phone now..just a teensy tiny bit better than the version before and they pretty much f... up the same things.

I mean look at Devin..this thing is just a joke :D a $2B hoax sold to investors and business owners.
