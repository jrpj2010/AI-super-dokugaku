[00:00 - 00:04]
Google has released a free PDF

[00:02 - 00:06]
explaining how prompt engineering works.

[00:04 - 00:08]
In fact, they have explained a lot of

[00:06 - 00:10]
important details that can help you

[00:08 - 00:12]
upskill yourself and understand prompt

[00:10 - 00:14]
engineering from a very technical

[00:12 - 00:16]
perspective. Now, if you're a

[00:14 - 00:18]
non-technical beginner, I will teach you

[00:16 - 00:21]
how to use Google's another AI tool

[00:18 - 00:24]
called Notebook LM. It's completely free

[00:21 - 00:26]
and Notebook LM can convert any PDF, any

[00:24 - 00:28]
book, any complicated website into

[00:26 - 00:30]
simpler notes as well as a proper

[00:28 - 00:33]
podcast. So you can literally upload a

[00:30 - 00:35]
100page long PDF and notebook element

[00:33 - 00:37]
would convert it into a conversation

[00:35 - 00:39]
between two AI avatars and the fun part

[00:37 - 00:41]
is that you can also join that

[00:39 - 00:43]
conversation and speak in between.

[00:41 - 00:46]
There's another important tool by Google

[00:43 - 00:48]
called AI studio. Shawic will help you

[00:46 - 00:50]
understand the use cases of that and how

[00:48 - 00:52]
exactly as a non-technical person you

[00:50 - 00:54]
can make the most of Google AI studio.

[00:52 - 00:56]
So today these two tools will help you

[00:54 - 00:58]
understand all the amazing things that

[00:56 - 01:00]
even Google has launched in their

[00:58 - 01:02]
portfolio and I hope this helps you as a

[01:00 - 01:04]
beginner. So let's get started. All

[01:02 - 01:07]
right. So you can download the PDF from

[01:04 - 01:08]
this link right here. I will attach the

[01:07 - 01:10]
link and once you have it, this is how

[01:08 - 01:12]
the PDF looks like. So let me just take

[01:10 - 01:14]
you through the contents. They basically

[01:12 - 01:17]
explain you how does an LLM works. So

[01:14 - 01:18]
LLM stands for a large language model.

[01:17 - 01:20]
If you don't want to understand this,

[01:18 - 01:22]
you can still skip it. But this part

[01:20 - 01:24]
right here about prompt engineering is

[01:22 - 01:26]
where you will find the most valuable

[01:24 - 01:28]
information around all the different

[01:26 - 01:30]
kinds of prompting techniques. Now,

[01:28 - 01:31]
because we have already explained you

[01:30 - 01:33]
how prompting works, I'm not going to

[01:31 - 01:36]
explain you the PDF, but I'll show you

[01:33 - 01:38]
how to use this PDF to fasttrack your

[01:36 - 01:39]
learning using Notebook LM. So, if you

[01:38 - 01:41]
go to

[01:39 - 01:43]
notebookm.google and click on try

[01:41 - 01:44]
notebookm, you'll see this window right

[01:43 - 01:46]
here. So, I am already logged into my

[01:44 - 01:48]
Gmail account. So, it says create your

[01:46 - 01:50]
first notebook. So, I'll click on

[01:48 - 01:53]
create. And this is where the fun begins

[01:50 - 01:55]
right here. You can either upload a PDF

[01:53 - 01:58]
or an audio file or you can attach any

[01:55 - 02:00]
Google document or Google slide or you

[01:58 - 02:02]
can paste a link of a YouTube video

[02:00 - 02:03]
which could be a very long lecture or

[02:02 - 02:06]
even a website as well. Or you can just

[02:03 - 02:08]
copy paste the text. So if I go to my

[02:06 - 02:10]
PDF right here and save this on my

[02:08 - 02:12]
desktop, I can upload that into notebook

[02:10 - 02:14]
LM and simply start learning from it. So

[02:12 - 02:16]
I'm just going to put this on my

[02:14 - 02:19]
desktop. I'll go to notebook LM. Click

[02:16 - 02:22]
on upload sources.

[02:19 - 02:24]
and select my file. Now, it takes a bit

[02:22 - 02:26]
of time to upload the file depending on

[02:24 - 02:28]
how many pages you have. On the left are

[02:26 - 02:30]
the sources. This is where you add all

[02:28 - 02:33]
the information that you want to learn

[02:30 - 02:34]
from. This can be videos, websites, PDF,

[02:33 - 02:36]
whatever it may be. So, you can do a lot

[02:34 - 02:37]
of stuff. And if you want to add more

[02:36 - 02:39]
sources, you will click on the add

[02:37 - 02:41]
button. If you click on discover, you

[02:39 - 02:42]
can actually describe what you would

[02:41 - 02:45]
like to learn and then get

[02:42 - 02:47]
recommendations from Notebook LM. So in

[02:45 - 02:49]
the center you can see a basic summary

[02:47 - 02:52]
of what this PDF is like. All right. So

[02:49 - 02:54]
in just a few seconds I was able to

[02:52 - 02:56]
generate a mind map of everything that

[02:54 - 02:58]
has been taught inside the PDF. So I can

[02:56 - 03:00]
actually click on these and open the

[02:58 - 03:03]
branches one by one. So as you can see

[03:00 - 03:05]
as soon as I clicked on these branches I

[03:03 - 03:06]
can now go through everything that they

[03:05 - 03:09]
have discussed in the introduction. So

[03:06 - 03:10]
if I go here uh and let's just say I go

[03:09 - 03:12]
to prompting techniques right and now

[03:10 - 03:13]
within the prompting techniques I have

[03:12 - 03:15]
so many interesting things. Let's just

[03:13 - 03:17]
say I want to understand tree of

[03:15 - 03:18]
thoughts. Right now within tree of

[03:17 - 03:19]
thoughts you have more and more

[03:18 - 03:22]
techniques and then you can have a

[03:19 - 03:24]
conversation on the mind map. Now this

[03:22 - 03:26]
is insanely useful but things become

[03:24 - 03:29]
even better because on the top right

[03:26 - 03:30]
corner we also have an audio overview

[03:29 - 03:34]
section. So if I click on generate

[03:30 - 03:36]
notebook LM will read the entire PDF and

[03:34 - 03:39]
create a live conversation that I can be

[03:36 - 03:40]
a part of. So it takes a few minutes but

[03:39 - 03:42]
let me show you this will absolutely

[03:40 - 03:44]
blow your mind. While this is

[03:42 - 03:46]
generating, if I click on study guide,

[03:44 - 03:48]
FAQ, briefing doc, I will actually have

[03:46 - 03:50]
notebook LM create these interesting

[03:48 - 03:52]
notes. So if I click on study guide

[03:50 - 03:54]
right here, if I was a teacher teaching

[03:52 - 03:56]
this subject, it'll help me create a

[03:54 - 03:58]
quiz, the answer key as well and a

[03:56 - 04:01]
glossery of all the key terms. So if I

[03:58 - 04:03]
am preparing for an exam as well, these

[04:01 - 04:05]
are some questions that I can use to

[04:03 - 04:07]
prepare which is so so valuable. If I go

[04:05 - 04:09]
to the second option right here, these

[04:07 - 04:11]
are basic notes. So it has made like a

[04:09 - 04:13]
list of important things uh that the

[04:11 - 04:16]
entire PDF is talking about and then we

[04:13 - 04:17]
also have an overview of everything that

[04:16 - 04:19]
they have written along with quotes as

[04:17 - 04:22]
well. So it's an extremely powerful

[04:19 - 04:24]
tool. I usually stick to either the mind

[04:22 - 04:25]
mapping tool or the conversation tool

[04:24 - 04:27]
because those two ones are the most

[04:25 - 04:30]
crazy ones. So we now have the podcast

[04:27 - 04:33]
with me and it's a 49minute long podcast

[04:30 - 04:35]
and let me play this for you. Welcome to

[04:33 - 04:37]
the deep dive. Today we're tackling

[04:35 - 04:40]
prompt engineering. You know, you fire

[04:37 - 04:42]
off prompts to AI all the time, right?

[04:40 - 04:44]
But turning those, these are AIS, by the

[04:42 - 04:47]
way. Really targeted requests that get

[04:44 - 04:49]
you seriously insightful outputs. Well,

[04:47 - 04:54]
that's the skill we're digging into.

[04:49 - 04:55]
Exactly. Um, think about asking for now

[04:54 - 04:57]
these two are talking about this, right?

[04:55 - 04:59]
And you can listen this while you're in

[04:57 - 05:02]
traffic and while you're going for work.

[04:59 - 05:03]
Now, if I click on interactive mode, let

[05:02 - 05:05]
me show you what happens. So when I

[05:03 - 05:06]
click on interactive mode, I can

[05:05 - 05:09]
actually be a part of the conversation.

[05:06 - 05:11]
So I hope this has been able to get

[05:09 - 05:14]
captured from my mic. But let me just do

[05:11 - 05:15]
this. So now if I click on play, the

[05:14 - 05:17]
conversation will start from the

[05:15 - 05:19]
beginning. Welcome to the deep dive

[05:17 - 05:20]
today. And now when I click on join,

[05:19 - 05:23]
I'll be able to speak in between. Fire

[05:20 - 05:26]
up. Oh wait, so what was the join? Hey,

[05:23 - 05:27]
go for it. Uh hi. Oh, so by the way, if

[05:26 - 05:29]
you're doing this for the first time,

[05:27 - 05:32]
you have to make sure that you click on

[05:29 - 05:35]
allow this time. And hey, I actually had

[05:32 - 05:38]
some questions.

[05:35 - 05:40]
Ah, time. It really does fly when you're

[05:38 - 05:41]
diving deep into fascinating topics,

[05:40 - 05:43]
doesn't it? It certainly does. And it's

[05:41 - 05:46]
great that you're here with us as we

[05:43 - 05:49]
unpack all of it. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Uh,

[05:46 - 05:50]
hi. Can you just help me understand the

[05:49 - 05:52]
best prompting technique for a college

[05:50 - 05:54]
student? Hi there. That's a fantastic

[05:52 - 05:55]
question and super relevant. Absolutely.

[05:54 - 05:58]
When you're a college student, you're

[05:55 - 06:00]
often looking to synthesize information.

[05:58 - 06:01]
Let me just take the mic there to just

[06:00 - 06:03]
make you see how it's talking. So

[06:01 - 06:05]
thinking about what the paper discusses

[06:03 - 06:08]
something like fot prompting could be

[06:05 - 06:10]
really useful for you. Definitely. So

[06:08 - 06:14]
now it is actually answering my question

[06:10 - 06:16]
and you know we are in such a magical

[06:14 - 06:18]
time. I really hope that colleges and

[06:16 - 06:19]
institutions actually look at this

[06:18 - 06:21]
because this will completely change the

[06:19 - 06:23]
way how people learn in general and this

[06:21 - 06:25]
is just phase one. The next tool that we

[06:23 - 06:28]
will teach you right now is called

[06:25 - 06:31]
Google AI studio. Now, if I go here and

[06:28 - 06:33]
type Google AI Studio, you'll be able to

[06:31 - 06:35]
access it for free. This is where you

[06:33 - 06:37]
can check out Google's latest AI model.

[06:35 - 06:38]
So, when you go here for the first time,

[06:37 - 06:40]
you can actually just click on try

[06:38 - 06:42]
Gemini and this is how it looks. The UI

[06:40 - 06:44]
keeps on changing from time to time. Uh,

[06:42 - 06:45]
but Shawick right now will take you

[06:44 - 06:48]
through some of the most coolest

[06:45 - 06:50]
features that this thing has. Trust me,

[06:48 - 06:52]
even if you are a non-technical person,

[06:50 - 06:54]
understanding the power of Gemini

[06:52 - 06:56]
through Google AI Studio will always put

[06:54 - 06:57]
you at a higher pedestal than people who

[06:56 - 07:00]
are just using normal Gemini through the

[06:57 - 07:02]
normal interface. Like this is the real

[07:00 - 07:04]
playground where a lot of cool things

[07:02 - 07:06]
happen. Hello, my name is Savic and

[07:04 - 07:08]
welcome to the tutorial on Google AI

[07:06 - 07:10]
Studio. So the first thing that you want

[07:08 - 07:14]
to do is open up your web browser and

[07:10 - 07:15]
type Google AI Studio and go to the link

[07:14 - 07:17]
and this is the first page that you'll

[07:15 - 07:19]
see. It's time to build. Experience the

[07:17 - 07:22]
multimodel. Use Google AI Studio. Try

[07:19 - 07:23]
Gemini. Okay. So, let's see what all

[07:22 - 07:25]
options you have. You need to give

[07:23 - 07:28]
consent. Click I accept. And that's it.

[07:25 - 07:29]
You can start building with Google AI

[07:28 - 07:31]
Studio directly. I'll walk you through

[07:29 - 07:34]
the UI. But before that, I want to show

[07:31 - 07:37]
you a very interesting feature on Google

[07:34 - 07:39]
AI Studio. On the left navigation panel,

[07:37 - 07:40]
go to stream real time. And a lot of

[07:39 - 07:42]
people have been talking about these

[07:40 - 07:44]
features where you can share your screen

[07:42 - 07:46]
and Google will look at what's going on

[07:44 - 07:48]
on your screen. It could be any

[07:46 - 07:51]
application, maybe how to download an

[07:48 - 07:52]
application or it will teach you coding.

[07:51 - 07:54]
But I'm going to show you something

[07:52 - 07:57]
interesting. I'm going to show you how

[07:54 - 07:59]
you can use the Gemini feature to use

[07:57 - 08:01]
your webcam to share Google what you're

[07:59 - 08:04]
looking at and get real-time feedback.

[08:01 - 08:07]
Okay, let's start with that. So, you'll

[08:04 - 08:11]
have to allow microphone. Okay. Hi. What

[08:07 - 08:13]
am I holding in my hand?

[08:11 - 08:15]
You are holding a foldable phone in your

[08:13 - 08:18]
hand. Is there anything else I can help

[08:15 - 08:21]
you with? Uh, what is this and how can I

[08:18 - 08:23]
connect this to my phone?

[08:21 - 08:25]
The item in your hand appears to be a

[08:23 - 08:27]
white case for wireless earbuds,

[08:25 - 08:28]
possibly from OnePlus, and you can

[08:27 - 08:30]
usually connect them to your phone via

[08:28 - 08:34]
Bluetooth. Is there anything else I can

[08:30 - 08:36]
help you with? Yes. Can you tell me uh

[08:34 - 08:39]
what this bottle is about? What is

[08:36 - 08:42]
written on the bottle? The bottle has

[08:39 - 08:44]
Kbasaki Kolkata written on it along with

[08:42 - 08:46]
some drawings of Kolkata city landmarks.

[08:44 - 08:48]
Is there anything else you would like to

[08:46 - 08:51]
ask? Can you see a picture of a yellow

[08:48 - 08:53]
taxi? Yes, I can see a picture of a

[08:51 - 08:55]
yellow taxi on the bottle. Is there

[08:53 - 08:58]
anything else you would like to ask? Can

[08:55 - 09:00]
you tell me who made this yellow taxi? I

[08:58 - 09:02]
want to know the name of the company.

[09:00 - 09:04]
I'm sorry, I cannot tell you who made

[09:02 - 09:06]
the yellow taxi image since it is just

[09:04 - 09:07]
part of the drawing on the bottle. Is

[09:06 - 09:10]
there something else I can assist you

[09:07 - 09:13]
with? Can you tell me what these two

[09:10 - 09:14]
buttons are for my watch? I see the

[09:13 - 09:16]
person in the video is holding up their

[09:14 - 09:19]
left arm and there is a watch on their

[09:16 - 09:21]
wrist. I see two buttons on the right

[09:19 - 09:24]
hand side of the watch. Is this what you

[09:21 - 09:27]
mean? Yes. Can you tell me what these

[09:24 - 09:28]
two buttons do? I can see the watch in

[09:27 - 09:30]
the video and it appears to have a dial

[09:28 - 09:32]
and two push buttons on the right hand

[09:30 - 09:34]
side. It is difficult for me to tell

[09:32 - 09:36]
what the buttons do without knowing the

[09:34 - 09:38]
specific model of the watch or being

[09:36 - 09:40]
able to physically interact with it.

[09:38 - 09:42]
Would you like me to guess at the most

[09:40 - 09:45]
common functions for buttons of that

[09:42 - 09:47]
style? Yes, it's a chronograph watch.

[09:45 - 09:50]
What does these button do? Okay. If it's

[09:47 - 09:52]
a chronograph watch, the top button is

[09:50 - 09:54]
likely used to start and stop the

[09:52 - 09:56]
chronograph function, which is like a

[09:54 - 09:58]
stopwatch, and the bottom button is

[09:56 - 10:02]
likely used to reset the chronograph. Is

[09:58 - 10:05]
that helpful? Yes. I can also see a dial

[10:02 - 10:08]
and this rotates. Can you tell me what's

[10:05 - 10:10]
the function of this rotating dial?

[10:08 - 10:12]
Based on the video, it looks like the

[10:10 - 10:15]
rotating dial is the bezel of the watch.

[10:12 - 10:17]
It can be used to track a lapse time or

[10:15 - 10:20]
time a particular event. Would you like

[10:17 - 10:22]
more information on this? Yes. What can

[10:20 - 10:24]
I use this for?

[10:22 - 10:26]
You can use the rotating bezel to time

[10:24 - 10:29]
events like cooking or parking time, for

[10:26 - 10:31]
example. To time an event, rotate the

[10:29 - 10:33]
bezel so the zero mark lines up with the

[10:31 - 10:35]
minute hand on the watch face. Then as

[10:33 - 10:37]
the event goes on, you can read the

[10:35 - 10:41]
elapse time on the bezel. Does that

[10:37 - 10:43]
help? Yeah. Can you help me how I can

[10:41 - 10:46]
connect this to my phone? Can you tell

[10:43 - 10:48]
me the model of my phone? Sure. I see a

[10:46 - 10:51]
foldable phone in your left hand. It

[10:48 - 10:54]
looks like a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. Is

[10:51 - 10:57]
that right? Yes. I want to connect it to

[10:54 - 10:59]
the earbuds in my hand. How do I connect

[10:57 - 11:02]
it? Okay, to connect those earbuds to

[10:59 - 11:03]
your Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, you'll first

[11:02 - 11:05]
need to open the charging case and then

[11:03 - 11:07]
on your phone, go to settings,

[11:05 - 11:09]
connections, and then Bluetooth. I mean,

[11:07 - 11:11]
once you're there, select scan or pair

[11:09 - 11:12]
new device, and it should show up. You

[11:11 - 11:14]
can then select it and connect it to the

[11:12 - 11:17]
phone. Would you like me to explain

[11:14 - 11:18]
anything else? No, that sounds great.

[11:17 - 11:20]
Thank

[11:18 - 11:22]
you. So, that's how stream realtime

[11:20 - 11:25]
works on Google AI Studio. So I was able

[11:22 - 11:28]
to show it my earphones, my earbuds and

[11:25 - 11:30]
my phone and it was able to tell me how

[11:28 - 11:33]
I can connect this to my phone. I was in

[11:30 - 11:36]
fact able to show my water bottle and it

[11:33 - 11:38]
told me that this is from Kolkata and it

[11:36 - 11:40]
has a yellow taxi which is from

[11:38 - 11:43]
Hindustan Motors. That is in fact a

[11:40 - 11:46]
really big deal. So let's look at other

[11:43 - 11:48]
features from Google AI Studio. So if

[11:46 - 11:50]
you go to create prompt on the left,

[11:48 - 11:52]
you'll be able to see some basic prompts

[11:50 - 11:54]
that you can click. You can click on

[11:52 - 11:56]
math tutor video Q&A. So I'm just going

[11:54 - 11:59]
to select one of this first to see what

[11:56 - 12:02]
it gives. Okay. So you can use that as a

[11:59 - 12:04]
basic chat GPD cla kind of thing. It's

[12:02 - 12:06]
basically using Gemini in the back end.

[12:04 - 12:09]
So I'm going to go back to create prompt

[12:06 - 12:12]
here again. It doesn't save your chats

[12:09 - 12:14]
automatically. So to enable chat you

[12:12 - 12:16]
need to enable autosave. So click on

[12:14 - 12:19]
that and it will ask you to log in. So

[12:16 - 12:21]
once you have enabled your chat you need

[12:19 - 12:23]
to click on the library and from here

[12:21 - 12:25]
you can select the ones which you have

[12:23 - 12:28]
saved. Okay to save a prompt go on the

[12:25 - 12:30]
top and from here you can rename your

[12:28 - 12:33]
prompt and I can just type math tutor

[12:30 - 12:35]
and math tutor equations and you can

[12:33 - 12:37]
just click on save and this will show up

[12:35 - 12:39]
on your library. Otherwise if you don't

[12:37 - 12:42]
save any prompt it's going to go away.

[12:39 - 12:44]
Hey you. So if I go to another tab it's

[12:42 - 12:46]
going to vanish and it's not going to

[12:44 - 12:48]
show up in your library. So make sure

[12:46 - 12:50]
you're saving your prompts with this

[12:48 - 12:53]
option on the top. So edit the title,

[12:50 - 12:55]
save it, and then go to the library to

[12:53 - 12:57]
check your save prompt. Okay. So let's

[12:55 - 12:59]
move on to the drive part. So all of

[12:57 - 13:01]
this is being stored in your Google

[12:59 - 13:03]
Drive. Let's look at this option for

[13:01 - 13:05]
comparing two different LLM models. So

[13:03 - 13:08]
if you click on compare, it's very

[13:05 - 13:10]
similar to LLM Marina. Which allows you

[13:08 - 13:12]
to compare two models, but in this case,

[13:10 - 13:16]
these are all Google models. So you can

[13:12 - 13:20]
click Gemini 2.0 O flash and flashlight

[13:16 - 13:22]
and you can just drive which is greater

[13:20 - 13:26]
8.22 or

[13:22 - 13:29]
9.1 one and let's see the output. Okay,

[13:26 - 13:32]
I have no idea why it's showing 11 but

[13:29 - 13:34]
let's see if it's able to. If you click

[13:32 - 13:37]
on this button called rerun, it should

[13:34 - 13:40]
rerun it for yeah now it shows 9.11 is

[13:37 - 13:42]
greater than 8.22. Let's rerun this as

[13:40 - 13:44]
well. Okay. So you can compare the

[13:42 - 13:46]
output of different models here. So some

[13:44 - 13:48]
of them might be better, some of them

[13:46 - 13:51]
are not as good. So go to create prompt

[13:48 - 13:52]
again and from the right navigation

[13:51 - 13:55]
panel, you can select the model you want

[13:52 - 13:57]
to use. All of this might sound really

[13:55 - 13:59]
confusing, but if you hover onto each

[13:57 - 14:01]
one of them, you'll be able to see what

[13:59 - 14:04]
they're best for. For example, Gemini

[14:01 - 14:06]
2.0 flashlight. This is used for long

[14:04 - 14:08]
context. And this is one of the key

[14:06 - 14:10]
features of Google Gemini. It can have

[14:08 - 14:12]
really long context. If you see the

[14:10 - 14:15]
number of token counts that it can have,

[14:12 - 14:18]
it's over a million. So this is what

[14:15 - 14:19]
differentiates Google Gemini and Google

[14:18 - 14:21]
AI studio from all the other

[14:19 - 14:24]
applications. If you want to use smaller

[14:21 - 14:26]
AI models, you can go ahead with Gemma

[14:24 - 14:28]
which has really small parameters. So

[14:26 - 14:30]
it's 27 billion 2 billion. You can

[14:28 - 14:32]
select the one which you want. So let's

[14:30 - 14:36]
look at the second model which is Gemini

[14:32 - 14:38]
2.0 flash image generation experimental.

[14:36 - 14:40]
Select the model and then select a

[14:38 - 14:44]
sample media from here. And let's just

[14:40 - 14:46]
say we want the picture of this turtle.

[14:44 - 14:49]
Okay, let's just write anything. Make it

[14:46 - 14:52]
fly in the sky. Let's see the output.

[14:49 - 14:55]
Well, it has changed the direction, but

[14:52 - 14:59]
it's still not the sky. Change the

[14:55 - 15:01]
background to blue sky. Okay, let's see.

[14:59 - 15:04]
So, in the output format, you should be

[15:01 - 15:06]
able to see images and text by default.

[15:04 - 15:08]
Okay. Yeah, this is somewhat similar to

[15:06 - 15:11]
what I was looking for. So, this is a

[15:08 - 15:13]
turtle who's flying in the sky. And

[15:11 - 15:16]
yeah, you can select any other image and

[15:13 - 15:18]
you can also ask Gemini to do something

[15:16 - 15:20]
with it. Maybe you can change the

[15:18 - 15:23]
background. You can ask it to change

[15:20 - 15:24]
anything else you want. So, these work

[15:23 - 15:30]
really well. So, let's select this one

[15:24 - 15:33]
and change the background to N2 F1

[15:30 - 15:35]
racrack racing car. Let's see. Well,

[15:33 - 15:37]
that doesn't look really good. I'm going

[15:35 - 15:40]
to ask it to prompt I'm prompting it

[15:37 - 15:43]
again to change background to racing

[15:40 - 15:45]
arena. I think you just need to assign

[15:43 - 15:47]
one task at a time. So, I asked you to

[15:45 - 15:50]
do two things here. It was able to add

[15:47 - 15:53]
the F1 racing car. It's not really

[15:50 - 15:54]
looking good, but let me see if it can.

[15:53 - 15:57]
Okay, it has changed. Okay, let me just

[15:54 - 15:59]
remove the car. Remove the car. You can

[15:57 - 16:01]
also see the token count here on your

[15:59 - 16:04]
right. This temperature is something

[16:01 - 16:06]
that you use to control the creativity

[16:04 - 16:08]
of air responses. If it's set to a

[16:06 - 16:11]
higher number, the air model will give

[16:08 - 16:13]
you more creative responses which may or

[16:11 - 16:16]
may not be consistent. But if it's at

[16:13 - 16:17]
zero, it will have no creativity and it

[16:16 - 16:20]
will give you really plain instead of

[16:17 - 16:23]
removing the car, I think it removes the

[16:20 - 16:25]
bicycle. So I think that it's not able

[16:23 - 16:27]
to comprehend the prompt properly or

[16:25 - 16:29]
it's not giving good results. But I

[16:27 - 16:31]
think if you keep trying with the

[16:29 - 16:33]
prompts a little more, it should be able

[16:31 - 16:35]
to give you your desired results. So

[16:33 - 16:37]
let's go back to the prompt. So go to

[16:35 - 16:40]
create prompt, click on this plus sign

[16:37 - 16:42]
and select YouTube video. So it will ask

[16:40 - 16:44]
you for a YouTube video URL. You can go

[16:42 - 16:46]
to youtube.com and you can select for

[16:44 - 16:49]
any video that you want. I'm just going

[16:46 - 16:51]
to select a simple Google AI studio

[16:49 - 16:54]
video from Google. Yeah, let's select

[16:51 - 16:56]
this one. I'm going to click share and

[16:54 - 16:59]
it has that link or you can select it

[16:56 - 17:01]
from here directly. So copy paste that

[16:59 - 17:03]
add to prompt and you can if you want

[17:01 - 17:06]
the transcript you can just be like

[17:03 - 17:08]
summarize this with the transcript or

[17:06 - 17:09]
you can just be like I just want the

[17:08 - 17:11]
transcript for this. So maybe just

[17:09 - 17:14]
extract the transcript. This is one use

[17:11 - 17:16]
case which you can use. Okay. Okay. So

[17:14 - 17:18]
you can see that it's a two I think

[17:16 - 17:20]
around two and a half minute long and

[17:18 - 17:24]
you can see the entire transcript for

[17:20 - 17:25]
this video. So it has used around 45,000

[17:24 - 17:27]
tokens. You can see the number of count.

[17:25 - 17:29]
You can also provide it longer videos.

[17:27 - 17:32]
So up to 30 minutes it's going to be

[17:29 - 17:34]
able to process. So that's one good

[17:32 - 17:36]
thing that we can use here with this

[17:34 - 17:39]
option for selecting YouTube video. And

[17:36 - 17:41]
you can click on camera and you can also

[17:39 - 17:43]
select your picture. You can take a

[17:41 - 17:45]
screenshot and you can ask it to do

[17:43 - 17:47]
something. You can use the image editing

[17:45 - 17:49]
tool directly from here. You can upload

[17:47 - 17:52]
your files from Google Drive. You can

[17:49 - 17:54]
upload your file from your directory or

[17:52 - 17:57]
you can also use a sample media. So the

[17:54 - 18:00]
other thing is these tools that we have

[17:57 - 18:03]
here on the right panel. Let me go to a

[18:00 - 18:06]
fresh prompt and if I type who is the

[18:03 - 18:09]
president of USA. Okay. The president of

[18:06 - 18:12]
United States is Joe Biden. If you go to

[18:09 - 18:16]
models and if you see the knowledge

[18:12 - 18:18]
cutoff it's of August 2024. So in August

[18:16 - 18:20]
2024, Joe Biden was the president of

[18:18 - 18:23]
United States. But if you want the

[18:20 - 18:25]
latest results, if you want Google

[18:23 - 18:27]
Gemini to look into the internet before

[18:25 - 18:29]
answering, you should turn on this

[18:27 - 18:32]
option called grounding with Google

[18:29 - 18:34]
search. So now you can rerun this and

[18:32 - 18:36]
it's going to use Google search and it's

[18:34 - 18:40]
going to say that as of 23rd March 2025,

[18:36 - 18:45]
it's Donald Trump. So let's look at some

[18:40 - 18:49]
other output. Maybe scrape data and put

[18:45 - 18:51]
JSON. So this is a JSON file. You have

[18:49 - 18:52]
the key and the value. So on the left

[18:51 - 18:55]
you have the key and on the right you

[18:52 - 18:57]
have the value. So you can create a JSON

[18:55 - 19:00]
file like that by selecting the generate

[18:57 - 19:02]
structured output option. Right? So I'm

[19:00 - 19:06]
going to select code execution. Now I'm

[19:02 - 19:09]
going to show you power of three, three.

[19:06 - 19:11]
Let's see. Yeah. So you can also type

[19:09 - 19:13]
something else if you want the code

[19:11 - 19:17]
execution. So you can write Fibonacci

[19:13 - 19:21]
series and let's say what it does print

[19:17 - 19:24]
up to 10 terms. So if you have the code

[19:21 - 19:25]
execution on it's going to execute code

[19:24 - 19:28]
in the prompt and it's also going to

[19:25 - 19:30]
give you the code execution result. So

[19:28 - 19:33]
whatever you want you can always go

[19:30 - 19:35]
ahead and use this option for this

[19:33 - 19:37]
particular thing. For function calling

[19:35 - 19:39]
this tool is not compatible because we

[19:37 - 19:41]
need to select. So if you click on edit

[19:39 - 19:43]
basically you'll be able to see all

[19:41 - 19:46]
these options. Enter a list of function

[19:43 - 19:48]
declaration for the model to call upon.

[19:46 - 19:51]
If you click on API documentation you'll

[19:48 - 19:52]
be able to understand more about this

[19:51 - 19:55]
particular thing. So introduction to

[19:52 - 19:57]
function calling from Gemini API how

[19:55 - 19:59]
function calling works. So basically you

[19:57 - 20:02]
create tool object function declaration.

[19:59 - 20:04]
So basically if you want the get weather

[20:02 - 20:06]
function so it's going to have

[20:04 - 20:08]
description and all these things. So you

[20:06 - 20:12]
can add function calling here as well.

[20:08 - 20:15]
Right? So let's go back to create prompt

[20:12 - 20:17]
again and select get code. So if you see

[20:15 - 20:19]
the get code option here, you can see

[20:17 - 20:21]
you can run this prompt with the Gemini

[20:19 - 20:23]
API after installing the relevant

[20:21 - 20:25]
package. If you click on these links,

[20:23 - 20:27]
you'll be able to see the documentation

[20:25 - 20:29]
for that. And also if you click on the

[20:27 - 20:31]
API docs, so this is going to give you a

[20:29 - 20:34]
quick reference as to how you can

[20:31 - 20:36]
install Gemini and how you can use the

[20:34 - 20:38]
API. So if you go to the get API key,

[20:36 - 20:41]
this is going to help you to set up your

[20:38 - 20:43]
API on Google cloud and you can also use

[20:41 - 20:45]
the Google cloud functions. So if you

[20:43 - 20:47]
click on API key, create API key, it's

[20:45 - 20:49]
going to ask you to let's see use your

[20:47 - 20:51]
API key securely. Do not share with

[20:49 - 20:54]
them. So it's this is going to be your

[20:51 - 20:56]
API key. You can click on copy and then

[20:54 - 20:58]
you can use your API key in your code.

[20:56 - 21:00]
Right? So I can see that I've created an

[20:58 - 21:02]
API key here. I can also delete this.

[21:00 - 21:05]
Okay. So let's go back to the Google

[21:02 - 21:07]
studio again. So the next option that I

[21:05 - 21:09]
wanted to show you was tune a model. So

[21:07 - 21:11]
if you click on tune a model here and

[21:09 - 21:14]
click structured output, you can give an

[21:11 - 21:19]
optional tone and style instructions for

[21:14 - 21:22]
the model. So be concise and answer in

[21:19 - 21:27]
one sentence. Okay. User input define

[21:22 - 21:29]
Python. Python is either a snake or a

[21:27 - 21:32]
programming language. Let's add

[21:29 - 21:35]
something else. Be concise and humorous.

[21:32 - 21:38]
an answer in one sentence. Okay. And

[21:35 - 21:40]
let's give write a test input. Define

[21:38 - 21:42]
apple. Let's see. An apple is either a

[21:40 - 21:45]
fruit or a company that makes you

[21:42 - 21:47]
question your life choices every time

[21:45 - 21:50]
you need a new charger. So, it is quite

[21:47 - 21:53]
funny because you can fine-tune your

[21:50 - 21:55]
model with tuner model. And let me give

[21:53 - 21:57]
another prompt here. So, I asked it to

[21:55 - 21:59]
be concise and you can, you know, give

[21:57 - 22:02]
your options like this. So, let's go

[21:59 - 22:04]
back to another application. So this was

[22:02 - 22:06]
how you can fine-tune a model and you

[22:04 - 22:08]
can select the kind of tone that you

[22:06 - 22:10]
want for your model. You can define

[22:08 - 22:13]
sample input and output and the model

[22:10 - 22:15]
will accordingly give you an answer. If

[22:13 - 22:17]
you go to prompt gallery here, there's a

[22:15 - 22:20]
huge collection of prompts that you can

[22:17 - 22:22]
use. For example, the recipe list. So

[22:20 - 22:24]
generate a list of cookie recipes, make

[22:22 - 22:27]
the outputs in JSON format. Structured

[22:24 - 22:30]
output is turned on here. So yeah, this

[22:27 - 22:32]
is what you can do. You can go ahead

[22:30 - 22:35]
select all these apps and you can uh

[22:32 - 22:37]
search. If you go to starter apps, you

[22:35 - 22:39]
can see that these are applications

[22:37 - 22:42]
built on top of Gemini. You can clone

[22:39 - 22:45]
them on GitHub. GitHub is a platform to

[22:42 - 22:47]
save all your code and you know it's a

[22:45 - 22:49]
version control application. So people

[22:47 - 22:52]
build application and then push their

[22:49 - 22:53]
code on GitHub so everyone else can see

[22:52 - 22:56]
it if you're looking at an open source

[22:53 - 22:57]
application. So let's click on map

[22:56 - 22:59]
explorer. I'm going to show you one of

[22:57 - 23:01]
these apps that are made on Google

[22:59 - 23:04]
Gemini and it's available in Google Air

[23:01 - 23:05]
Studio. Take me somewhere cold. So, it's

[23:04 - 23:06]
one of the coldest permanently

[23:05 - 23:09]
inherited. So, it's going to take you to

[23:06 - 23:10]
these places. You can select and you can

[23:09 - 23:14]
see where these places are and you can

[23:10 - 23:18]
also ask questions. Best place in India

[23:14 - 23:21]
for food. Okay, let's ask are you being

[23:18 - 23:23]
biased? All right, so it's saying that

[23:21 - 23:25]
best place in India for food is Lucknau

[23:23 - 23:27]
and you can go to Lucknow. So it's going

[23:25 - 23:30]
to recommend you places and this is the

[23:27 - 23:32]
output right. So you can go and check

[23:30 - 23:35]
out the other two apps as well. So

[23:32 - 23:37]
spatial understanding will help you to

[23:35 - 23:40]
understand a photo with spatial

[23:37 - 23:42]
analysis. If I click on that, let me

[23:40 - 23:46]
select one of these options. Maybe this

[23:42 - 23:49]
and items. Let's select this one to

[23:46 - 23:52]
foods. Okay, let's see if it's Yeah, it

[23:49 - 23:53]
is adding these boxes here. Okay, so

[23:52 - 23:56]
these are some of the applications that

[23:53 - 23:58]
you can see in the starter apps. If you

[23:56 - 24:00]
click on the API documentation, it's

[23:58 - 24:03]
going to take you to Gemini developer

[24:00 - 24:06]
API section where you can learn how you

[24:03 - 24:09]
can use Gemini API key in your codebase.

[24:06 - 24:11]
And that's about it from API. And if you

[24:09 - 24:13]
click on developer forum, this is a

[24:11 - 24:15]
place where developers discuss about

[24:13 - 24:18]
Google AI studio and what people are

[24:15 - 24:20]
building with it. So make sure to check

[24:18 - 24:23]
that out as well. So going back to

[24:20 - 24:26]
stream real time, this is where the real

[24:23 - 24:28]
fun happens and we already saw how

[24:26 - 24:31]
Gemini can look at your webcam and it

[24:28 - 24:34]
can identify objects. Now let's try to

[24:31 - 24:36]
do something else. If we share our

[24:34 - 24:39]
screen, let's say entire screen and

[24:36 - 24:42]
share. Hi, I want to learn coding. Where

[24:39 - 24:43]
should I go and learn coding? Can you

[24:42 - 24:45]
help me with that? Sure, there are many

[24:43 - 24:47]
resources available to learn coding. Do

[24:45 - 24:50]
you have a specific programming language

[24:47 - 24:52]
or area of coding you're interested in?

[24:50 - 24:54]
Yes, I want to start with the very

[24:52 - 24:56]
basics and want to go deeper into

[24:54 - 24:59]
programming. So, I'm thinking C++ or

[24:56 - 25:01]
Java. Okay. Starting with the basics and

[24:59 - 25:03]
then moving into C++ or Java is a good

[25:01 - 25:05]
approach. There are many websites that

[25:03 - 25:07]
offer free resources for learning to

[25:05 - 25:08]
code. Would you like me to suggest some

[25:07 - 25:11]
websites that offer introductory

[25:08 - 25:12]
materials for those languages? Yes. Can

[25:11 - 25:14]
you suggest me some websites and I can

[25:12 - 25:16]
go and directly start coding from there?

[25:14 - 25:18]
I want some hands-on experience.

[25:16 - 25:19]
Absolutely. Okay. Here are a few

[25:18 - 25:22]
websites where you can start coding

[25:19 - 25:24]
directly. Code Academy, Khan Academy,

[25:22 - 25:26]
and Free Code Camp. These websites offer

[25:24 - 25:28]
a good mix of interactive lessons and

[25:26 - 25:30]
coding challenges. They are great for

[25:28 - 25:31]
beginners, but you might also find some

[25:30 - 25:33]
advanced content there. Would you like

[25:31 - 25:36]
me to look up some resources specific to

[25:33 - 25:39]
C++ or Java for you? Yes, I want to

[25:36 - 25:42]
directly start using Java. So, I think I

[25:39 - 25:45]
can use online IDE for C++. Great

[25:42 - 25:46]
choice. Using an online IDE is a

[25:45 - 25:48]
fantastic way to get started coding

[25:46 - 25:50]
immediately. It eliminates the need to

[25:48 - 25:53]
set up a local development environment.

[25:50 - 25:55]
Many websites offer online C++ IDEs. Can

[25:53 - 25:57]
you tell me suggestions or would you

[25:55 - 26:00]
rather Can you tell me what's on my

[25:57 - 26:02]
screen? I can see some code. Is this C++

[26:00 - 26:05]
and what does this mean? On your screen

[26:02 - 26:08]
is an online C++ compiler. The code you

[26:05 - 26:10]
see is a basic C++ program. The hashtag

[26:08 - 26:12]
include less than ioam greater than line

[26:10 - 26:14]
includes a library for input output

[26:12 - 26:16]
operations. The int main defines the

[26:14 - 26:19]
main function where the program

[26:16 - 26:23]
execution begins. The line std code less

[26:19 - 26:25]
than less than try programmise.pro will

[26:23 - 26:26]
print that text to the console and the

[26:25 - 26:28]
return statement will indicate

[26:26 - 26:30]
successful execution. Do you have any

[26:28 - 26:32]
questions about that code? If I remove

[26:30 - 26:34]
the return zero, will this code still

[26:32 - 26:36]
work or throw an error? Generally in

[26:34 - 26:38]
modern C++, if the main function doesn't

[26:36 - 26:40]
have a return statement, it defaults to

[26:38 - 26:42]
returning zero, which indicates

[26:40 - 26:44]
successful execution. However, it's

[26:42 - 26:46]
considered good practice to explicitly

[26:44 - 26:48]
include the return zero for readability

[26:46 - 26:50]
and to make it clear that the program

[26:48 - 26:53]
terminated without errors. In some older

[26:50 - 26:54]
compilers, it may throw an error, but in

[26:53 - 26:56]
general, your code should run. Do you

[26:54 - 26:58]
have any other questions about this?

[26:56 - 27:01]
What if I change the int main to void

[26:58 - 27:03]
main? Is this correct? No, changing int

[27:01 - 27:05]
main to void main is generally not

[27:03 - 27:07]
recommended in standard C++. While it

[27:05 - 27:09]
might work on some compilers, it's not

[27:07 - 27:12]
guaranteed to be correct and can lead to

[27:09 - 27:14]
unexpected behavior or errors. The C++

[27:12 - 27:16]
standard dictates that the main function

[27:14 - 27:18]
should return an integer. Therefore,

[27:16 - 27:19]
sticking with intain is the best way to

[27:18 - 27:21]
go. Do you have any other questions I

[27:19 - 27:24]
can answer about C++? This was one

[27:21 - 27:27]
example for coding. Let's uh start

[27:24 - 27:29]
another one to see if it can help with

[27:27 - 27:31]
design as well. I'm going to go to a new

[27:29 - 27:33]
tab and I want you to help me with

[27:31 - 27:34]
Canva. Okay. You want help with Canva.

[27:33 - 27:38]
What do you want to do with Canva? I

[27:34 - 27:40]
want to create an invitation card for my

[27:38 - 27:41]
friends who are coming for a party.

[27:40 - 27:43]
Okay. You want to create an invitation

[27:41 - 27:45]
card for a party using Canva. You'll

[27:43 - 27:47]
first need to log in. Do you want to use

[27:45 - 27:49]
the option to sign in with Google or do

[27:47 - 27:52]
you have another way to log into Canva?

[27:49 - 27:54]
Okay. I'm here and I'm going to select

[27:52 - 27:57]
invitation. Okay. I'm going to select

[27:54 - 27:59]
invitation portrait. And from here, I

[27:57 - 28:01]
want your help to create an invitation

[27:59 - 28:04]
for me. Okay. You have selected an

[28:01 - 28:06]
invitation in portrait format. Now, you

[28:04 - 28:07]
want help creating the invitation. Do

[28:06 - 28:09]
you have any specific ideas on the style

[28:07 - 28:11]
you'd like for the invitation, or would

[28:09 - 28:12]
you like me to help you select from one

[28:11 - 28:14]
of the templates available on the left?

[28:12 - 28:16]
Help me select from one of the templates

[28:14 - 28:19]
and then we can add elements later. It's

[28:16 - 28:21]
a casual party, so you can help me add

[28:19 - 28:23]
some elements. Okay. Since it is a

[28:21 - 28:25]
casual party, let's look at some of the

[28:23 - 28:26]
templates available and see if one

[28:25 - 28:29]
catches your eye. How about we try the

[28:26 - 28:31]
invitation category? Okay, there are

[28:29 - 28:34]
other categories. Okay, I can see party

[28:31 - 28:37]
invitation and yes, let's select this

[28:34 - 28:38]
one. Yep. Now, what should I do? Okay,

[28:37 - 28:40]
now you've selected the black and gold

[28:38 - 28:42]
elegant dinner party template. What do

[28:40 - 28:44]
you want to do next? Do you want to

[28:42 - 28:46]
change the text or add any additional

[28:44 - 28:48]
elements? I want to add additional

[28:46 - 28:49]
elements. How can I do that? I want to

[28:48 - 28:51]
remove these elements as well. Okay. To

[28:49 - 28:53]
add additional elements, you can click

[28:51 - 28:55]
on the elements tab on the left sidebar.

[28:53 - 28:57]
Once you do that, you can search for a

[28:55 - 28:58]
specific element or browse through the

[28:57 - 29:00]
different options available. Would you

[28:58 - 29:02]
like me to show you how that looks?

[29:00 - 29:04]
Yeah. Which elements can I search for?

[29:02 - 29:06]
Suggest me some elements I can add to my

[29:04 - 29:08]
invitation card for the casual party.

[29:06 - 29:10]
Okay. For a casual party invitation, you

[29:08 - 29:13]
could search for elements like confetti,

[29:10 - 29:15]
balloons, party hats, or cocktail

[29:13 - 29:18]
glasses. You can also search for more

[29:15 - 29:19]
abstract shapes or lines to add to your

[29:18 - 29:21]
design. Would you like to try searching

[29:19 - 29:25]
for any of these? Yeah, I just did that.

[29:21 - 29:27]
So, help me add these and how I can, you

[29:25 - 29:29]
know, finalize it. And then what should

[29:27 - 29:31]
I do? Should I write my name here? Yes,

[29:29 - 29:33]
you should change Avery Davis to your

[29:31 - 29:36]
name. You can click on that text box and

[29:33 - 29:38]
then edit the text there. Okay, perfect.

[29:36 - 29:40]
So, this is where I should add. And what

[29:38 - 29:42]
else do I do? Do I need to remove this

[29:40 - 29:44]
or does it look okay? That box is a

[29:42 - 29:46]
placeholder. So, you will want to add

[29:44 - 29:47]
the address to the party there. But you

[29:46 - 29:49]
can remove it if you'd like to place the

[29:47 - 29:51]
address elsewhere. What else would you

[29:49 - 29:52]
like to do with your invitation card? Do

[29:51 - 29:54]
you want to add an image or change the

[29:52 - 29:56]
color scheme? Let's change the color

[29:54 - 29:58]
scheme. Okay. To change the color

[29:56 - 29:59]
scheme, you can click on any element or

[29:58 - 30:01]
part of the background that you want to

[29:59 - 30:03]
change. Then you can use the color

[30:01 - 30:04]
picker to select a new color. Which part

[30:03 - 30:06]
of the invitation would you like to

[30:04 - 30:08]
change the color of first? Let's change

[30:06 - 30:10]
the background color. Okay. Click on the

[30:08 - 30:12]
background of the invitation to select

[30:10 - 30:14]
it and then use the color picker that

[30:12 - 30:15]
appears on the toolbar to choose a new

[30:14 - 30:18]
color for the background. Do you have a

[30:15 - 30:21]
specific color in mind? Okay, so I'm

[30:18 - 30:23]
going to finish the stream. And this is

[30:21 - 30:27]
how you can use the stream real time

[30:23 - 30:29]
option on Gemini, Google AI studio to

[30:27 - 30:31]
learn about coding, to learn about

[30:29 - 30:33]
design, Canva, anything that you want to

[30:31 - 30:36]
learn about, you can share your screen

[30:33 - 30:38]
and you can have a realtime AI assistant

[30:36 - 30:41]
guiding you and helping you learn

[30:38 - 30:43]
different things. So this is really good

[30:41 - 30:46]
and it's going to help a lot of people

[30:43 - 30:48]
skip all the hassle of going to YouTube

[30:46 - 30:50]
tutorials and they can just continue

[30:48 - 30:53]
talking. Right now according to my

[30:50 - 30:55]
opinion I think that it's still under

[30:53 - 30:57]
progress. So it's still experimental. It

[30:55 - 30:59]
asks you a lot of questions before

[30:57 - 31:02]
answering. So this is something that's

[30:59 - 31:04]
going to be work in progress. And yeah

[31:02 - 31:07]
go ahead go to a studio.google.com

[31:04 - 31:09]
google.com. Play around with all the

[31:07 - 31:12]
options which I just showed you,

[31:09 - 31:15]
especially the stream realtime option.

[31:12 - 31:17]
You can show the webcam your things and

[31:15 - 31:18]
you can ask questions. You can ask it to

[31:17 - 31:20]
translate text. If you don't know

[31:18 - 31:22]
anything on your phone, if you don't

[31:20 - 31:24]
know how to, you know, update a software

[31:22 - 31:28]
or something like that, you can go ahead

[31:24 - 31:30]
ask Google AI Studio that. So, we are

[31:28 - 31:32]
actually living in a really fun time and

[31:30 - 31:35]
this is going to change a lot of things.

[31:32 - 31:37]
So that's it from me and bye. So these

[31:35 - 31:39]
are all the things that you can do with

[31:37 - 31:41]
Google AI Studio. I'd recommend you

[31:39 - 31:43]
check out the API documentation if you

[31:41 - 31:45]
want to use it with your code, but

[31:43 - 31:47]
definitely check out the stream real

[31:45 - 31:49]
time. Use the webcam, show it some

[31:47 - 31:52]
objects, and ask questions. And that's

[31:49 - 31:54]
it. This is Soroy signing off. We had

[31:52 - 31:55]
never made a video on Notebook LM or

[31:54 - 31:57]
Google AI Studio. So I thought it was

[31:55 - 31:59]
high time that we cover these subjects

[31:57 - 32:01]
as well. The best part is that you can

[31:59 - 32:03]
try all of it for free. So I'll put all

[32:01 - 32:04]
the links in description. The PDF to

[32:03 - 32:06]
learn prompt engineering is also going

[32:04 - 32:08]
to be in the description. Make sure you

[32:06 - 32:10]
comment below what would you want us to

[32:08 - 32:11]
cover next. We have already released

[32:10 - 32:14]
free courses on this YouTube channel

[32:11 - 32:16]
that will teach you AI agents, video

[32:14 - 32:19]
editing, content creation, increasing

[32:16 - 32:21]
your followers, make.com automations,

[32:19 - 32:23]
every fundamental skill for beginners

[32:21 - 32:25]
has been taught here all for free.

[32:23 - 32:27]
Please make sure that you share this

[32:25 - 32:29]
across WhatsApp groups on LinkedIn. I

[32:27 - 32:31]
would love to see your notes on social

[32:29 - 32:34]
media. I hope that you're taking care of

[32:31 - 32:36]
your mind and body. This is your do an

Wanted to watch this specific video since very long but finally watched it today and I am speechless seeing how supremely helpful and time saving these tools are. I'll be grateful if you ever decide and create a series on Freelancing from beginning to land a client and it would be cherry on top if you pick Video Editing as a niche. As always, grateful for all the learnings

Hey Ansh!
I really admire your work and the way you explain things. I see you as a mentor, and your content truly motivates me to become better. I'm a UI/UX designer, and I'm also trying to learn AI and explore how it can help me in my design journey.

Sometimes I feel stuck or inconsistent, and I'm not sure where to start or what to focus on first. If you could share some advice on how to stay consistent and grow in both UI/UX and AI, it would really mean a lot to me.

Woooow just amazingly explained. Ansh, thank you so much this just too good. 
Guys, Ansh is literally spoon feeding us with these videos, & still if we don't take advantage, we are missing out on a lot of skills g knowledge.

> **@CuttingEdgeSchool** (üëç 1): thank you for recognising the importance of this!

I tried them both. Notebook LM works really well.
Google AI Studio's connection to the server keeps failing when I use the stream option. Though, it generated a good enough video after it made me reframe my prompt several times due to safety reasons.
Thank you, guys!
Plus, Mr. Roy, you could use some sleep.

Hey Ansh! So much knowledge we can get from the channel, can we have a roadmap in order to apply these tools apparently and  not just limit ourselves to consume the content. Well, no other channel has done this yet. We would be grateful if we have the information and the direction to drive ourselves (that was motto of the channel üòÖ). On a personal level, not able to use these informations creates a chaos in the mind. It would be very helpful if you solve this for us.
