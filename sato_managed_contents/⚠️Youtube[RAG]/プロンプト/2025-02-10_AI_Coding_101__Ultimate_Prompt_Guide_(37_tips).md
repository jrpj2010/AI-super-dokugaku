[00:00 - 00:03]
when you're coding with AI the way you

[00:01 - 00:05]
word your prompts can be the difference

[00:03 - 00:07]
between building a full stack

[00:05 - 00:10]
application in under an hour and

[00:07 - 00:12]
troubleshooting for multiple hours and

[00:10 - 00:14]
making absolutely no progress I've spent

[00:12 - 00:16]
over a thousand hours coding with AI and

[00:14 - 00:18]
I've learned a lot of things along the

[00:16 - 00:19]
way so I will share those lessons with

[00:18 - 00:21]
you today as well as some specific

[00:19 - 00:24]
prompts that you can use so when it

[00:21 - 00:25]
comes to writing new code my first tip

[00:24 - 00:27]
is to use a specific list of

[00:25 - 00:30]
Technologies or approaches that you want

[00:27 - 00:32]
the AI to use this is going to ensure

[00:30 - 00:34]
that it's going to be easy for you to

[00:32 - 00:36]
iterate on the code after the initial

[00:34 - 00:38]
version is created and make sure that

[00:36 - 00:40]
all of the tools and Technologies you're

[00:38 - 00:43]
using actually make sense and work

[00:40 - 00:45]
together well additionally when you use

[00:43 - 00:47]
specific Technologies it signals to the

[00:45 - 00:49]
AI that you at least sort of know what

[00:47 - 00:51]
you're doing so the average output

[00:49 - 00:52]
quality tends to be higher now when it

[00:51 - 00:54]
comes to choosing the specific

[00:52 - 00:56]
technologies that you're going to use I

[00:54 - 00:58]
would lean heavily towards really

[00:56 - 01:01]
popular languages and Frameworks because

[00:58 - 01:03]
AI is much more familiar with those so

[01:01 - 01:06]
the code that it writes is going to be

[01:03 - 01:08]
higher quality also you'll have a larger

[01:06 - 01:10]
Community to help answer questions and

[01:08 - 01:13]
you'll have many more clear examples

[01:10 - 01:15]
available online that you can reference

[01:13 - 01:18]
so use things like JavaScript and Python

[01:15 - 01:20]
and some common databases like postgress

[01:18 - 01:22]
for example if you're not sure of the

[01:20 - 01:24]
specific Technologies I have a link in

[01:22 - 01:26]
the description to The Prompt guide that

[01:24 - 01:28]
will show all of the prompts in this

[01:26 - 01:29]
video as well as a glossery of

[01:28 - 01:31]
technologies that you can reference when

[01:29 - 01:34]
when crafting your prompts my next tip

[01:31 - 01:36]
for writing new code is to design a

[01:34 - 01:39]
solution and then ask the AI to build it

[01:36 - 01:41]
don't just give it a totally open-ended

[01:39 - 01:43]
prompt for example if we have a website

[01:41 - 01:46]
that shows a list of products and we

[01:43 - 01:49]
want to add a search feature we could

[01:46 - 01:51]
ask the AI to just implement it but that

[01:49 - 01:54]
doesn't give enough specific detail on

[01:51 - 01:56]
what should actually be done do we want

[01:54 - 01:59]
the search to search just by product

[01:56 - 02:00]
title should it be description should we

[01:59 - 02:02]
have a bunch of different filters in

[02:00 - 02:05]
there you see as you start to think

[02:02 - 02:07]
about how the feature should actually be

[02:05 - 02:09]
implemented there's a lot more detail

[02:07 - 02:11]
that comes out that you should really

[02:09 - 02:13]
think through before you have the AI

[02:11 - 02:15]
implemented because if you build it and

[02:13 - 02:17]
let's say you were assuming that it

[02:15 - 02:19]
should use the description but it's not

[02:17 - 02:21]
searching by that and then you just keep

[02:19 - 02:22]
saying well it doesn't work it doesn't

[02:21 - 02:25]
work you'll just get stuck in an

[02:22 - 02:27]
infinite Loop but if you think ahead of

[02:25 - 02:30]
time how you want that feature to work

[02:27 - 02:32]
and you spell it out for the AI it's

[02:30 - 02:34]
much more likely to do exactly what you

[02:32 - 02:36]
want this also makes it less ambiguous

[02:34 - 02:38]
for the AI so it's more likely to write

[02:36 - 02:40]
good code now since we're thinking

[02:38 - 02:42]
through how the features should work and

[02:40 - 02:44]
what we want the AI to do one great way

[02:42 - 02:46]
to organize your prompt is to break

[02:44 - 02:49]
things down and give it a list of things

[02:46 - 02:51]
that it needs to do so instead of that

[02:49 - 02:53]
open-ended build a search feature we

[02:51 - 02:55]
should say you know build a search

[02:53 - 02:58]
feature and then it should work with

[02:55 - 03:00]
titles and descriptions number two we

[02:58 - 03:03]
should have the ability to filter by

[03:00 - 03:06]
different product types number three we

[03:03 - 03:08]
should add a sorting capability if you

[03:06 - 03:10]
give it a list of tasks then it can

[03:08 - 03:13]
focus on each one of those and Implement

[03:10 - 03:15]
everything kind of integrated all

[03:13 - 03:18]
together instead of you then iterating

[03:15 - 03:20]
on it step by step which brings me to

[03:18 - 03:23]
the next point which is that you really

[03:20 - 03:26]
need to find the right balance of scope

[03:23 - 03:28]
of work to give to the AI because if you

[03:26 - 03:30]
give it just very small Snippets of work

[03:28 - 03:32]
to do then you're going to spend a lot

[03:30 - 03:34]
of time iterating and not making a lot

[03:32 - 03:37]
of progress on your app like you could

[03:34 - 03:39]
ask it to you know move an icon here or

[03:37 - 03:42]
add some padding there but like you'll

[03:39 - 03:44]
just end up spending so much time uh

[03:42 - 03:46]
that you could otherwise be building you

[03:44 - 03:48]
know entire features with on the flip

[03:46 - 03:51]
side of course if you ask for it to

[03:48 - 03:53]
build an entire application you can't

[03:51 - 03:56]
expect that it's going to do that all in

[03:53 - 03:58]
one go so there's very much a balance to

[03:56 - 04:01]
strike between the amount of work you

[03:58 - 04:03]
give it being too little or too large

[04:01 - 04:05]
and knowing the right amount really just

[04:03 - 04:06]
comes with experience so I strongly

[04:05 - 04:09]
recommend that you go and actually try

[04:06 - 04:11]
to build apps using Ai and then you'll

[04:09 - 04:14]
run into situations where you're asking

[04:11 - 04:16]
for too much or you're spending so much

[04:14 - 04:17]
time you know in the little details so

[04:16 - 04:20]
definitely look to find the right

[04:17 - 04:23]
balance all right my next tip is to use

[04:20 - 04:26]
examples in your prompt let's say we are

[04:23 - 04:28]
building a function to format dates well

[04:26 - 04:29]
it's going to be much easier for you to

[04:28 - 04:32]
give it examples of what you want want

[04:29 - 04:35]
your dates to look like than to describe

[04:32 - 04:37]
every possible Edge case of how it

[04:35 - 04:39]
should work AI tends to do pretty well

[04:37 - 04:42]
when it sees examples like that and the

[04:39 - 04:44]
other thing you can do with examples is

[04:42 - 04:47]
give it sample code that already works

[04:44 - 04:48]
so if you have a certain library that

[04:47 - 04:50]
you're trying to integrate with or a

[04:48 - 04:52]
tool that you're integrating with you

[04:50 - 04:55]
can just find code online that already

[04:52 - 04:58]
works and copy paste it and have the AI

[04:55 - 05:00]
start from there I found that to really

[04:58 - 05:03]
accelerate and make it much more likely

[05:00 - 05:05]
to succeed in the first go and speaking

[05:03 - 05:08]
of documentation a lot of the AI coding

[05:05 - 05:10]
tools have a feature that allows you to

[05:08 - 05:13]
immediately reference some official

[05:10 - 05:14]
documentation or search the web using

[05:13 - 05:16]
these tools can really speed up your

[05:14 - 05:18]
work because you don't have to go find

[05:16 - 05:21]
the documentation or the specific thing

[05:18 - 05:23]
on the web and it can also improve the

[05:21 - 05:25]
quality of the solution that the AI

[05:23 - 05:27]
creates when building something new

[05:25 - 05:28]
another thing you should try to do is

[05:27 - 05:31]
make sure that the code that the AI

[05:28 - 05:33]
wrote is both secure and performs well

[05:31 - 05:35]
and you can do this either in the

[05:33 - 05:37]
original prompt that you make to the AI

[05:35 - 05:39]
or you can do it as an immediate

[05:37 - 05:40]
followup after it successfully

[05:39 - 05:42]
implements the feature and you can

[05:40 - 05:45]
simply ask if there are any security

[05:42 - 05:47]
vulnerabilities that this introduces and

[05:45 - 05:49]
whether the approach that it took is the

[05:47 - 05:51]
most efficient one and it can also help

[05:49 - 05:53]
to be proactive about this and consult

[05:51 - 05:55]
the AI to see if there are any

[05:53 - 05:57]
considerations or best practices when

[05:55 - 05:59]
working with a particular piece of

[05:57 - 06:00]
software or a particular feature that

[05:59 - 06:02]
you're trying to to develop now when it

[06:00 - 06:04]
comes to testing you have two options

[06:02 - 06:06]
you can either do the same thing that we

[06:04 - 06:09]
were talking about with security and

[06:06 - 06:11]
performance and ask it as a follow-up or

[06:09 - 06:13]
you could actually take a test driven

[06:11 - 06:16]
development approach where the AI writes

[06:13 - 06:18]
the test first and then implements the

[06:16 - 06:20]
feature to make sure that it satisfies

[06:18 - 06:22]
all of those tests that way you can even

[06:20 - 06:25]
make sure that it handles all of the

[06:22 - 06:27]
edge cases before it starts writing any

[06:25 - 06:30]
of the code this works particularly well

[06:27 - 06:32]
if you're using AI agents because you

[06:30 - 06:34]
can have them iteratively write the

[06:32 - 06:36]
tests build the feature run the test to

[06:34 - 06:38]
make sure that the feature passes all of

[06:36 - 06:40]
them and doesn't break any other ones

[06:38 - 06:42]
and then if any of them fail you can

[06:40 - 06:45]
have the AI agent iterate on the code

[06:42 - 06:47]
until all of them actually pass and on

[06:45 - 06:49]
the documentation front it always helps

[06:47 - 06:50]
to have your code be well documented

[06:49 - 06:52]
whether that's comments in the functions

[06:50 - 06:55]
that you write or a nicely formatted

[06:52 - 06:57]
readme you can also have the AI write

[06:55 - 06:59]
documentation for your end users so they

[06:57 - 07:02]
can figure out how the software actually

[06:59 - 07:03]
Works since the AI has access to your

[07:02 - 07:06]
code it can write very effective

[07:03 - 07:08]
documentation that very precisely

[07:06 - 07:10]
describes what should be happening my

[07:08 - 07:13]
final tip for writing new code is to be

[07:10 - 07:15]
careful with how you name things the old

[07:13 - 07:17]
adage goes there are only two hard

[07:15 - 07:20]
things in computer science cach

[07:17 - 07:24]
invalidation and naming things and it's

[07:20 - 07:25]
more true now than ever because AI uses

[07:24 - 07:29]
the names of your files of your

[07:25 - 07:30]
functions of your classes to figure out

[07:29 - 07:33]
what is is actually happening in your

[07:30 - 07:35]
code and it's going to follow the

[07:33 - 07:37]
patterns of your naming when it

[07:35 - 07:40]
generates new code so if you have a

[07:37 - 07:42]
function that's intended to process csvs

[07:40 - 07:45]
you should call it something like CSV

[07:42 - 07:47]
parser rather than data parser because

[07:45 - 07:50]
then if you want to add parsing for

[07:47 - 07:51]
different data formats uh the AI is

[07:50 - 07:53]
going to just try to jam everything into

[07:51 - 07:56]
that function instead of writing a new

[07:53 - 07:58]
one so it's good to try to stay on top

[07:56 - 07:59]
of the naming and keep it up to date

[07:58 - 08:01]
which really brings us to the next

[07:59 - 08:03]
section of this video which is what do

[08:01 - 08:06]
you do when you're working with existing

[08:03 - 08:08]
code and trying to modify it well to

[08:06 - 08:10]
continue the naming example you want to

[08:08 - 08:13]
continuously update the naming and

[08:10 - 08:16]
organization of your code base as the

[08:13 - 08:18]
code expands and one way you can do this

[08:16 - 08:21]
is to ask it to refactor and simplify

[08:18 - 08:24]
your code so this is a really handy

[08:21 - 08:26]
prompt that I like to use is to ask the

[08:24 - 08:28]
AI to refactor a particular file and

[08:26 - 08:30]
I'll typically tell it the specific

[08:28 - 08:32]
names of the things that I want to

[08:30 - 08:35]
extract out into a new file and this

[08:32 - 08:38]
will keep your files very focused and

[08:35 - 08:40]
keep your codebase nicely organized

[08:38 - 08:42]
which is very important because at its

[08:40 - 08:45]
core coding with AI really has a lot to

[08:42 - 08:49]
do with managing context and this is

[08:45 - 08:51]
really the golden rule of coding with AI

[08:49 - 08:53]
and if you take anything away from this

[08:51 - 08:57]
video it would be this you have to

[08:53 - 08:59]
properly manage and balance the context

[08:57 - 09:01]
that you give to the AI because if if

[08:59 - 09:04]
you don't give it enough context to work

[09:01 - 09:06]
with AI is going to assume things about

[09:04 - 09:08]
your code that might not be accurate and

[09:06 - 09:10]
then the new code that it writes

[09:08 - 09:12]
fundamentally doesn't work with your

[09:10 - 09:15]
existing code and you end up in that

[09:12 - 09:17]
super messy Loop of trying to get it to

[09:15 - 09:20]
fix itself and then it doesn't know what

[09:17 - 09:22]
to do because now you have code with one

[09:20 - 09:24]
set of assumptions and code with another

[09:22 - 09:27]
set and it's all co-existing and it just

[09:24 - 09:30]
becomes a really big mess so if you can

[09:27 - 09:32]
give it relevant files to use in its

[09:30 - 09:35]
context when it's writing some new code

[09:32 - 09:38]
that's the best way to get new code that

[09:35 - 09:40]
actually works with your existing code

[09:38 - 09:42]
now on the other side of this is when

[09:40 - 09:44]
you got too much context if you got a

[09:42 - 09:47]
file and it includes your entire piece

[09:44 - 09:49]
of software and it's 5,000 lines long

[09:47 - 09:51]
the AI is going to get confused it's

[09:49 - 09:54]
going to start deleting portions of your

[09:51 - 09:56]
code it's going to create duplicate

[09:54 - 09:58]
functions because it can't really find

[09:56 - 10:00]
the relevant pieces of code that it

[09:58 - 10:02]
needs to consider and this becomes

[10:00 - 10:04]
equally problematic because it just

[10:02 - 10:06]
can't write code that works with your

[10:04 - 10:08]
existing software and a lot of people

[10:06 - 10:10]
fall into this trap and It's Perfectly

[10:08 - 10:11]
Natural especially when you're getting

[10:10 - 10:13]
started and you don't know how to

[10:11 - 10:15]
properly organize your code base so

[10:13 - 10:17]
naming things and continuously

[10:15 - 10:19]
refactoring right that's what we were

[10:17 - 10:21]
talking about earlier becomes even more

[10:19 - 10:25]
important because it allows you to tag

[10:21 - 10:28]
the relevant files and pass that context

[10:25 - 10:30]
to your subsequent AI requests the other

[10:28 - 10:32]
thing to keep in mind mind is that as

[10:30 - 10:34]
you're having that conversation about

[10:32 - 10:37]
the code and having AI generate new code

[10:34 - 10:40]
you are expanding the context because

[10:37 - 10:42]
every message in your conversation gets

[10:40 - 10:44]
passed to the AI and it goes through all

[10:42 - 10:46]
of that when it generates new code for

[10:44 - 10:48]
you so if you've had a conversation

[10:46 - 10:51]
that's been going on for like half an

[10:48 - 10:54]
hour AI is much more likely to get

[10:51 - 10:56]
confused and start you know referencing

[10:54 - 10:58]
old pieces of code that don't exist

[10:56 - 11:01]
anymore or just failing to do what you

[10:58 - 11:03]
ask get to do and this is a tricky thing

[11:01 - 11:05]
because you want to make sure that you

[11:03 - 11:08]
have the relevant context but the longer

[11:05 - 11:11]
your conversation goes the more context

[11:08 - 11:14]
there is and AI will start to get

[11:11 - 11:15]
confused so you got to really balance

[11:14 - 11:18]
when you have too much context and too

[11:15 - 11:21]
little context so one powerful tool at

[11:18 - 11:23]
your disposal is to start a new

[11:21 - 11:25]
conversation and one common way that I

[11:23 - 11:27]
like to think about it is if you're

[11:25 - 11:29]
building a new feature that doesn't

[11:27 - 11:31]
directly have to do with with everything

[11:29 - 11:33]
you've built up to this point that's

[11:31 - 11:35]
when you should start a new chat and

[11:33 - 11:38]
then just tag the relevant files you

[11:35 - 11:40]
could even reference some parts of your

[11:38 - 11:42]
previous conversation but it's much

[11:40 - 11:44]
better to have a fresh start when you're

[11:42 - 11:46]
building something new ultimately it is

[11:44 - 11:48]
going to be a balance and experience

[11:46 - 11:50]
will guide you in terms of when it's

[11:48 - 11:52]
good to continue a conversation versus

[11:50 - 11:55]
start a new one my next tip about

[11:52 - 11:57]
iterating with code is to tell the AI

[11:55 - 12:00]
what works well and what you want to be

[11:57 - 12:02]
changed so often my my flow will go

[12:00 - 12:04]
something like this I'll ask the AI to

[12:02 - 12:07]
implement a feature I'll use a list to

[12:04 - 12:09]
tell it what it needs to do and it'll

[12:07 - 12:11]
often make some mistakes like it'll make

[12:09 - 12:13]
good progress towards what I want but it

[12:11 - 12:16]
won't be perfect and so I like to tell

[12:13 - 12:18]
it what did work and then what I still

[12:16 - 12:21]
want to be changed because this focuses

[12:18 - 12:23]
its attention on fixing those things and

[12:21 - 12:25]
makes sure that the things that it

[12:23 - 12:27]
already implemented correctly don't

[12:25 - 12:30]
become broken another thing I like to do

[12:27 - 12:33]
when working with existing code is to

[12:30 - 12:35]
ask it to find edge cases or potential

[12:33 - 12:37]
bugs in the code that I'm working with

[12:35 - 12:39]
this is a good thing to add to your

[12:37 - 12:42]
repertoire because it's going to make

[12:39 - 12:44]
sure that you build quality software

[12:42 - 12:45]
that's bug-free so typically if you

[12:44 - 12:48]
build a feature you go through the

[12:45 - 12:50]
iterations everything seems to work now

[12:48 - 12:52]
you should just go ahead and ask are

[12:50 - 12:54]
there any edge cases that we're not

[12:52 - 12:56]
currently handling you know do you see

[12:54 - 12:59]
any issues in the code this will help

[12:56 - 13:01]
you handle those additional cases and

[12:59 - 13:03]
build a higher quality product speaking

[13:01 - 13:06]
of reviewing the code after you've built

[13:03 - 13:09]
the feature another thing you can do is

[13:06 - 13:11]
directly ask the AI to review the code

[13:09 - 13:13]
and this is something I like to do after

[13:11 - 13:15]
I make some major changes and of course

[13:13 - 13:17]
you always want to review the code

[13:15 - 13:19]
yourself you do want to see that things

[13:17 - 13:21]
are implemented in the way that you

[13:19 - 13:23]
expect them to work and that the AI

[13:21 - 13:26]
isn't doing something unnecessary or

[13:23 - 13:29]
insecure so always review the code

[13:26 - 13:31]
yourself but you can use AI to

[13:29 - 13:33]
essentially get a head start on that

[13:31 - 13:35]
process by reviewing the code and then

[13:33 - 13:37]
you can walk through those results uh it

[13:35 - 13:40]
can be really helpful another thing I

[13:37 - 13:42]
like to do is just ask the AI what the

[13:40 - 13:44]
current code does and how it works

[13:42 - 13:46]
because this will usually highlight for

[13:44 - 13:48]
me certain things that I might be

[13:46 - 13:50]
missing and give me some context about

[13:48 - 13:53]
the rest of the code base and how this

[13:50 - 13:54]
code fits into it it's much faster to

[13:53 - 13:57]
get started like this than trying to

[13:54 - 13:59]
read things line by line especially when

[13:57 - 14:01]
you're working with a large piece of

[13:59 - 14:03]
code and obviously this is going to be

[14:01 - 14:05]
super helpful if you're not 100%

[14:03 - 14:08]
comfortable with code just yet in trying

[14:05 - 14:09]
to understand how it all works and then

[14:08 - 14:12]
it'll actually help you learn how to

[14:09 - 14:14]
code in the process moving on to the

[14:12 - 14:16]
troubleshooting section inevitably

[14:14 - 14:19]
things will go wrong and there will be

[14:16 - 14:21]
issues and there will be bugs and the AI

[14:19 - 14:23]
won't Implement everything perfectly the

[14:21 - 14:25]
first time around so what do you do in

[14:23 - 14:27]
those cases well there are several

[14:25 - 14:29]
prompts and techniques that you can use

[14:27 - 14:30]
to really accelerate your

[14:29 - 14:32]
troubleshooting the first thing I like

[14:30 - 14:35]
to do is to be very specific about what

[14:32 - 14:37]
is going wrong and what is going right

[14:35 - 14:39]
it's similar to that prompt that we were

[14:37 - 14:41]
talking about earlier where you're

[14:39 - 14:43]
iterating on a particular feature well

[14:41 - 14:45]
in the case of troubleshooting when

[14:43 - 14:48]
you're working out a particular bug you

[14:45 - 14:51]
really want to say like this piece is

[14:48 - 14:53]
working but this other piece is not and

[14:51 - 14:56]
then you really want to dive into which

[14:53 - 14:58]
cases things work and where they fail

[14:56 - 15:00]
and give it as much detail as you can

[14:58 - 15:02]
often times you can also share

[15:00 - 15:04]
screenshots with tools that accept those

[15:02 - 15:05]
and that can actually help the AI

[15:04 - 15:07]
understand what you're saying because if

[15:05 - 15:09]
you're using words like you know it's

[15:07 - 15:12]
not centered or it's sticking all the

[15:09 - 15:14]
way to the top it might not really know

[15:12 - 15:16]
the context in which you're talking

[15:14 - 15:18]
about but if you share a screenshot it's

[15:16 - 15:20]
going to help it understand and make the

[15:18 - 15:22]
right change also when it comes to

[15:20 - 15:24]
troubleshooting I find it's super

[15:22 - 15:26]
helpful if you can just share the errors

[15:24 - 15:29]
that you're getting with the AI so just

[15:26 - 15:31]
copy paste the entire error

[15:29 - 15:33]
um and then it'll likely be able to

[15:31 - 15:35]
figure out where the problem is you can

[15:33 - 15:38]
actually take this approach one step

[15:35 - 15:41]
further and use what I call the beaver

[15:38 - 15:44]
method and ask the AI to write a bunch

[15:41 - 15:47]
of logs in your code that will help you

[15:44 - 15:49]
then troubleshoot and what you do is you

[15:47 - 15:51]
create all of those logs and then you

[15:49 - 15:54]
try to run the program and you copy

[15:51 - 15:56]
paste all of that back to the AI and

[15:54 - 15:59]
it'll be able to figure out at what part

[15:56 - 16:01]
of your process did something break so

[15:59 - 16:03]
because you're using logs instead of

[16:01 - 16:06]
just waiting for an error it gives it a

[16:03 - 16:08]
lot more detail and context into what's

[16:06 - 16:11]
going on and I found that to be a really

[16:08 - 16:13]
useful method in troubleshooting often

[16:11 - 16:16]
times after just a couple of iterations

[16:13 - 16:18]
using this approach uh it'll be able to

[16:16 - 16:20]
fix the issue but sometimes even after

[16:18 - 16:22]
doing a bunch of troubleshooting you

[16:20 - 16:24]
still end up kind of stuck and not sure

[16:22 - 16:27]
where to go next and so the first line

[16:24 - 16:29]
of attack in that case is to ask the AI

[16:27 - 16:31]
to describe what the code is currently

[16:29 - 16:33]
doing this goes back to that prompt we

[16:31 - 16:35]
were talking about when modifying code

[16:33 - 16:38]
because if you can understand what the

[16:35 - 16:40]
code is doing it can help you understand

[16:38 - 16:43]
why there is an issue in it perhaps

[16:40 - 16:46]
there is a specific case that you hadn't

[16:43 - 16:48]
accounted for and the AI explaining that

[16:46 - 16:50]
could help you actually see that problem

[16:48 - 16:52]
and then think through how you would

[16:50 - 16:54]
actually like to solve it instead of

[16:52 - 16:56]
just relying on the AI and assuming that

[16:54 - 16:58]
it'll figure out the best way to handle

[16:56 - 17:00]
it but sometimes even after you read it

[16:58 - 17:02]
it still doesn't make sense and you're

[17:00 - 17:05]
still having an issue so what do you do

[17:02 - 17:08]
then well I have one secret weapon for

[17:05 - 17:11]
you it is one word and that word is

[17:08 - 17:13]
radical for whatever reason I have found

[17:11 - 17:15]
this word to be super effective in

[17:13 - 17:17]
breaking through these troubleshooting

[17:15 - 17:20]
loops and specifically what I mean is

[17:17 - 17:23]
you ask it to try something radically

[17:20 - 17:25]
different try a radically different

[17:23 - 17:28]
approach and I've been really surprised

[17:25 - 17:30]
by the number of times in which this

[17:28 - 17:33]
prompt is the thing that gets me through

[17:30 - 17:35]
the issue because it really forces the

[17:33 - 17:38]
AI to think differently and instead of

[17:35 - 17:41]
trying to like adjust little details it

[17:38 - 17:44]
just backs all the way up and tries a

[17:41 - 17:47]
really different approach but sometimes

[17:44 - 17:49]
even that doesn't work so what do you do

[17:47 - 17:51]
when you've been there for multiple

[17:49 - 17:53]
hours you've tried pasting the logs

[17:51 - 17:55]
you've tried radically different

[17:53 - 17:58]
solution what do you do you're you're

[17:55 - 18:00]
stuck right well that's where you got to

[17:58 - 18:02]
actually know how to code you got to

[18:00 - 18:04]
understand what the code is doing so

[18:02 - 18:06]
that you can look into the code and find

[18:04 - 18:08]
the problem maybe there's just a

[18:06 - 18:10]
conceptual issue with the way you've

[18:08 - 18:13]
been approaching the particular problem

[18:10 - 18:15]
and there's just no possible way that

[18:13 - 18:17]
you can make it work there may be

[18:15 - 18:19]
fundamental constraints that you haven't

[18:17 - 18:22]
considered or limitations with the

[18:19 - 18:24]
technologies that you're using so my

[18:22 - 18:28]
final tip for troubleshooting is that

[18:24 - 18:31]
you need to know when to pause and when

[18:28 - 18:33]
to go look at the code and there's again

[18:31 - 18:34]
very much a balance to this similar to

[18:33 - 18:37]
you know some of the other prompts we

[18:34 - 18:39]
were talking about you have to know when

[18:37 - 18:42]
you've hit that point at which it really

[18:39 - 18:44]
doesn't make sense to keep asking the AI

[18:42 - 18:46]
to fix it now you don't want to do that

[18:44 - 18:49]
right away because oftentimes AI can

[18:46 - 18:50]
work through a lot of issues and if you

[18:49 - 18:52]
just keep pasting the prompts or you

[18:50 - 18:55]
tell it to take a different approach it

[18:52 - 18:58]
can be much faster to get through the

[18:55 - 19:00]
problems that way than digging deep into

[18:58 - 19:02]
the code and fully understanding it so

[19:00 - 19:04]
you can definitely save time by having

[19:02 - 19:06]
AI try to troubleshoot itself in the

[19:04 - 19:08]
ways that we've been talking about but

[19:06 - 19:11]
at some point you do want to be able to

[19:08 - 19:13]
go into the code and figure out what's

[19:11 - 19:14]
happening and of course that brings us

[19:13 - 19:17]
to our last section which is about

[19:14 - 19:19]
learning how to code you can use AI to

[19:17 - 19:21]
help you learn and so all of these

[19:19 - 19:24]
things we've been talking about you

[19:21 - 19:27]
don't absolutely need to know code to be

[19:24 - 19:29]
able to do but when you run into those

[19:27 - 19:31]
issues where you get complet completely

[19:29 - 19:34]
stuck that's when it becomes suddenly

[19:31 - 19:36]
absolutely necessary to know code and

[19:34 - 19:38]
how it works so I'll share some prompts

[19:36 - 19:40]
and tips with you in terms of what you

[19:38 - 19:41]
should ask when you're trying to learn

[19:40 - 19:44]
how to code and the first thing is you

[19:41 - 19:45]
want to ask the AI to keep things simple

[19:44 - 19:47]
and you want to tell it that you're a

[19:45 - 19:50]
new developer and that you're learning

[19:47 - 19:51]
how to code if you don't do that and you

[19:50 - 19:54]
just ask about how this function works

[19:51 - 19:56]
or what not it'll just assume that you

[19:54 - 19:58]
have a developer understanding of the

[19:56 - 20:00]
situation but if you tell it that you're

[19:58 - 20:03]
a new developer and you specifically ask

[20:00 - 20:06]
it to keep it simple it can really help

[20:03 - 20:08]
it fine-tune that response to make sure

[20:06 - 20:10]
that you can actually learn and

[20:08 - 20:12]
understand from what it's saying now

[20:10 - 20:14]
that's useful for explaining code at a

[20:12 - 20:16]
high level like when you're looking at a

[20:14 - 20:18]
piece of code and you're asking for a

[20:16 - 20:21]
description but the thing that I also

[20:18 - 20:23]
like to do is ask it to explain code

[20:21 - 20:26]
line by line and you can have it either

[20:23 - 20:28]
just explain it in a chat or you could

[20:26 - 20:30]
have it add comments to your code so

[20:28 - 20:33]
that you can follow along and that will

[20:30 - 20:35]
help you understand the syntax of what's

[20:33 - 20:37]
happening and then be able to learn as

[20:35 - 20:40]
you do that over and over you're going

[20:37 - 20:41]
to start to see a lot of patterns in the

[20:40 - 20:44]
code and then you'll be able to follow

[20:41 - 20:46]
those and you'll first know how to read

[20:44 - 20:49]
it and then when you run into issues you

[20:46 - 20:51]
might notice hey this doesn't look like

[20:49 - 20:53]
the same kind of syntax or approach that

[20:51 - 20:56]
we used in the past when doing this kind

[20:53 - 20:57]
of thing so then you can tell the AI and

[20:56 - 20:58]
that's really the process of learning

[20:57 - 21:01]
right you're you're seeing these

[20:58 - 21:03]
patterns you're starting to understand

[21:01 - 21:06]
how they all fit together and if you ask

[21:03 - 21:08]
it to explain things line by line you

[21:06 - 21:09]
will start to have a deeper

[21:08 - 21:11]
understanding of how the code actually

[21:09 - 21:14]
works but learning the code isn't just

[21:11 - 21:16]
limited to the code itself like we've

[21:14 - 21:19]
been talking about it can really help to

[21:16 - 21:21]
use specific vocabulary specific

[21:19 - 21:24]
Technologies Concepts when you're

[21:21 - 21:26]
formulating all these prompts so you can

[21:24 - 21:29]
actually use AI to learn those and you

[21:26 - 21:32]
can just specifically ask it to explain

[21:29 - 21:34]
a particular concept and how it relates

[21:32 - 21:36]
maybe to the code that you're looking at

[21:34 - 21:39]
or maybe even just outside the code you

[21:36 - 21:41]
know ask it to explain how a full stack

[21:39 - 21:43]
application works or ask it to explain

[21:41 - 21:45]
different data types in your table for

[21:43 - 21:47]
example just having those conversations

[21:45 - 21:50]
with the AI about various components and

[21:47 - 21:52]
Technologies can raise your overall

[21:50 - 21:54]
awareness of how software works and how

[21:52 - 21:57]
all the pieces fit together another

[21:54 - 21:59]
thing I like to do is ask the AI how it

[21:57 - 22:02]
would build something so let's say we

[21:59 - 22:04]
want to build a chat app I would ask how

[22:02 - 22:07]
do we do that you know what are the

[22:04 - 22:09]
Architectural Components for building a

[22:07 - 22:11]
chat app what are the things that we

[22:09 - 22:13]
need to consider um and you'll soon

[22:11 - 22:15]
realize there are different ways of

[22:13 - 22:17]
implementing chat like you could have a

[22:15 - 22:19]
central server or you could have

[22:17 - 22:21]
peer-to-peer communication and again

[22:19 - 22:22]
these things you know people don't tend

[22:21 - 22:25]
to think about until you get into the

[22:22 - 22:27]
weeds of coding and then it suddenly

[22:25 - 22:29]
becomes super important and it goes all

[22:27 - 22:32]
the way back to building our software

[22:29 - 22:33]
and being specific about the features

[22:32 - 22:36]
that we want to implement and how we

[22:33 - 22:38]
want them to be implemented so it all

[22:36 - 22:40]
kind of Loops back in on itself you know

[22:38 - 22:42]
you learn how to code you understand the

[22:40 - 22:44]
code then you can give good prompts so

[22:42 - 22:47]
you can build better code right and the

[22:44 - 22:49]
cycle continues another thing you can do

[22:47 - 22:51]
when learning is ask the AI to show you

[22:49 - 22:52]
some examples and we did this in the

[22:51 - 22:55]
previous video where we were talking

[22:52 - 22:57]
about software Basics and we had to

[22:55 - 22:59]
generate you know some examples in

[22:57 - 23:01]
JavaScript showing functions showing

[22:59 - 23:04]
different data types so that can be a

[23:01 - 23:05]
really powerful technique to use as well

[23:04 - 23:07]
and as you're working through those

[23:05 - 23:10]
examples or working on a particular

[23:07 - 23:13]
piece of code another thing that helps

[23:10 - 23:15]
is to tell the AI what you do understand

[23:13 - 23:17]
versus what is unclear because then

[23:15 - 23:19]
it'll be able to connect the things that

[23:17 - 23:21]
are unclear it'll focus on explaining

[23:19 - 23:23]
those and it'll connect them to the

[23:21 - 23:25]
things that you do already understand so

[23:23 - 23:27]
it just creates a more complete picture

[23:25 - 23:29]
of whatever it is you're exploring my

[23:27 - 23:31]
last tip is to focus Less on the

[23:29 - 23:33]
specific syntax of a language and focus

[23:31 - 23:36]
more on the bigger picture and how

[23:33 - 23:38]
various software components fit together

[23:36 - 23:40]
and that's where it really helps to

[23:38 - 23:43]
actually understand what a full stack

[23:40 - 23:45]
application actually looks like and what

[23:43 - 23:47]
are the different layers of it which is

[23:45 - 23:50]
exactly what we're covering in the next

[23:47 - 23:52]
video in the AI coding 101 series how

[23:50 - 23:54]
full stack applications actually work I

[23:52 - 23:57]
hope to see you there thanks for

[23:54 - 23:57]
watching take care

Coding this way is such a paradigm shift that it takes content like this to help you think in new ways.  Mind blown.  Thank you.

> **@VoloBuilds** (üëç 1): Absolutely - glad it was helpful!

### 2. @MrCalletennis (üëç 25)
Your voice/speed in which you talk in par with your knowledge is gold. Keep it up!

Best video I've seen on this topic so far. Please keep them coming

> **@VoloBuilds** (üëç 0): Thank you! Working on the next one now!

### 4. @stevenwall760 (üëç 0)
Fantastic tips! I'm a long time coder and have been increasingly using AI. Some of the tips around prompt generation I've found to be spot on. While the others are great insight I can't wait to put into practice. One thing I hear a lot is the generated code must be reviewed. Which I've found to be valid. The take you added where the AI is also reviewing the final code for bugs is a great twist. Why not?! I've used it to review entire source bases for critic, but not to find bugs. BTW, reviewing the entire source base has proven enlightening. The speed at which this is accomplished is also mind blowing.

> **@VoloBuilds** (üëç 0): Thank you very much! I actually just made a video expanding on some of these exact points and providing additional tips given the latest advancements! Check it out :) https://youtu.be/qWm8yJ_mDAs

### 5. @jonmhayden (üëç 6)
I just started my ai coding journey and hit that issue where the agent couldn‚Äôt fix my issue. I spent hours trying to fix and kept resetting to a known good state and would ask to try something different. But could never get it to work right. This was using vscode essentials with copilot. So I then opened windsurf and asked it to fix the issue. That IDE fixed the issue on its first try with 2 lines of code. So I would suggest other IDEs or models might do a better job when you can‚Äôt fix something.

> **@VoloBuilds** (üëç 2): That's awesome! Yeah I think Cursor and Windsurf are far ahead of VSCode (last I tried it anyway)

### 6. @edoron777 (üëç 1)

### 9. @captain365 (üëç 0)
Realy like the way you do this. Voice, tempo, the things you tell without being to elaborate. 
I am really interested how i can connect Cursor / VSCode to perplexity and use Claude from there for instance.  
Great work. Thanks.

> **@VoloBuilds** (üëç 0): Thank you so much! I haven't played with the perplexity APIs so can't advise on that front, but I will say that Cursor already has built-in search and Claude Sonnet 4 is the best and default model that they use

### 10. @John316Ministries (üëç 2)
Thanks so much! I'm very convinced into learning to code now. Best teacher ever!

> **@VoloBuilds** (üëç 0): Hell yea! That's awesome! Wishing you all the best on your journey!

### 13. @rupnikj (üëç 4)
Great insights üöÄüöÄüöÄ! One extra thing related to prompts that I find useful: stuff like cursor rules where you setup a system message around coding conventions, preferences and philosophy. Keep up the great work!

> **@VoloBuilds** (üëç 0): Great tip!

### 14. @eddvdm (üëç 0)
Very grateful for you to share such good tips. As someone that is just starting into AI coding - as an experienced developer - I can't thank you enough.

Good quality content. After watching some of your video's I start working with Cursor AI. Amazing tool! Have been using VS professional and VS code for a decade but this is the future of working.

> **@VoloBuilds** (üëç 1): That's awesome! Yeah it's a really powerful tool

### 19. @silvamiracle2347 (üëç 0)
What about using md files that is sort of like docstrings for each page and backend routes and data models ? 
Using md files for everything shouldn't better than the imperative way of asking Cursor agents ?

### 20. @SoftwareDev1431-e8u (üëç 0)
best tips on this topic so far üíØ thanks a lot for sharing buddy, god bless!
