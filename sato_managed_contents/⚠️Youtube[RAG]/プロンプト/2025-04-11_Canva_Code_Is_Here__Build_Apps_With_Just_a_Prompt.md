[00:00 - 00:05]
Canva dropped another bombshell at Canva

[00:02 - 00:08]
Create. You can now code with Canva.

[00:05 - 00:09]
That's right. Vibe coding in Canva. I

[00:08 - 00:12]
didn't see this one coming. With Canva

[00:09 - 00:15]
code, you can now just type in a simple

[00:12 - 00:18]
prompt or you can even speak to the AI

[00:15 - 00:21]
and ask it to build a website, an

[00:18 - 00:24]
interactive game or activity, a widget,

[00:21 - 00:26]
or a simple app and Canva will handle

[00:24 - 00:29]
all of the coding for you. How easy is

[00:26 - 00:32]
that? So in this video I want to give

[00:29 - 00:34]
you a first glimpse at Canva code, what

[00:32 - 00:36]
it can do, how it works, and we will

[00:34 - 00:37]
start building some cool stuff together.

[00:36 - 00:41]
Let's

[00:37 - 00:45]
go. Coding is one of the last frontiers

[00:41 - 00:47]
that Canva hasn't yet conquered. You

[00:45 - 00:49]
know, they started with design, then

[00:47 - 00:52]
they moved into presentations and then

[00:49 - 00:55]
video and then websites and then, you

[00:52 - 00:58]
know, whiteboards, AI, and now this

[00:55 - 01:00]
Canva code. the coding tool and I think

[00:58 - 01:04]
it does make a lot of sense today. There

[01:00 - 01:06]
are so many vibe coding apps or websites

[01:04 - 01:08]
or solutions. Vibe coding is this

[01:06 - 01:10]
concept that you don't need to know code

[01:08 - 01:13]
or programmation languages in order to

[01:10 - 01:17]
code anymore because you can rely on the

[01:13 - 01:19]
AI to handle that part for you. So vibe

[01:17 - 01:22]
coding is definitely a thing today with

[01:19 - 01:25]
famous apps like ripplet cursor or these

[01:22 - 01:27]
kind of platforms that allow people who

[01:25 - 01:30]
have never learned a line of code in

[01:27 - 01:33]
their life to code entire interactive

[01:30 - 01:36]
experiences apps websites whatever. So

[01:33 - 01:38]
this is what Canva is after. In this

[01:36 - 01:40]
video I want to show you how it works.

[01:38 - 01:42]
It's called Canva Code and this is the

[01:40 - 01:44]
official kind of announcement we

[01:42 - 01:47]
received from Canva. Build interactive

[01:44 - 01:50]
experiences with AI. Just a few text

[01:47 - 01:52]
prompts generate functional dynamic

[01:50 - 01:54]
experiences in moments such as custom

[01:52 - 01:57]
calculators, prototypes, or campaign

[01:54 - 02:00]
widgets and then embed them in any Canva

[01:57 - 02:02]
design. This is pretty cool. The demo we

[02:00 - 02:05]
were showed is the one of creating kind

[02:02 - 02:06]
of like a package calculator. That's

[02:05 - 02:08]
what you are seeing right here on

[02:06 - 02:11]
screen. So, important to know is that

[02:08 - 02:14]
this Canva code tool is part of Canva

[02:11 - 02:17]
AI. That's the last button code for me

[02:14 - 02:19]
from the Canva AI interface. It's also

[02:17 - 02:22]
going to be a premium. So, it will be

[02:19 - 02:25]
using this unified credit system for all

[02:22 - 02:28]
things AI in Canva. Meaning, that's the

[02:25 - 02:30]
good news that both free and pro users

[02:28 - 02:32]
will be able to use Canva code.

[02:30 - 02:34]
Obviously, pro users or paid users will

[02:32 - 02:37]
get more uses, but free users will be

[02:34 - 02:41]
able to try it. All right. So, what I

[02:37 - 02:43]
suggest is that we get into it. we roll

[02:41 - 02:46]
up our virtual sleeves and start

[02:43 - 02:48]
building stuff with Canva code. So once

[02:46 - 02:51]
again, it all starts from the homepage.

[02:48 - 02:53]
We just click on the Canva AI button

[02:51 - 02:55]
right here and use the code for me

[02:53 - 02:57]
button. Okay, that's how you access

[02:55 - 03:00]
Canva code. Let me quickly zoom out so

[02:57 - 03:03]
you can see a bit more of what this page

[03:00 - 03:06]
looks like. So from here we will get

[03:03 - 03:09]
four, one, two, three. So we have 12

[03:06 - 03:12]
different use cases here or templated

[03:09 - 03:14]
prompts to start different coding

[03:12 - 03:17]
projects. Okay. So we have create a

[03:14 - 03:19]
pricing calculator for my services, an

[03:17 - 03:21]
interactive historical timeline, an

[03:19 - 03:24]
interactive menu for a restaurant,

[03:21 - 03:27]
flashcard game, a countdown timer that

[03:24 - 03:28]
could be cool for an offer or lounge

[03:27 - 03:31]
that you are about to do, digital

[03:28 - 03:34]
birthday card, a 3D game, interactive

[03:31 - 03:36]
map. So all of this is pretty cool. And

[03:34 - 03:39]
what happens when you click on one of

[03:36 - 03:43]
these, it will preload a prompt right

[03:39 - 03:45]
here to give some instructions to the

[03:43 - 03:47]
model to the Canva AI so that it can

[03:45 - 03:49]
start generating your experience.

[03:47 - 03:52]
Immediately I can see that from here I

[03:49 - 03:55]
can also use the voice command. Okay, so

[03:52 - 03:57]
this will work as well. But since I have

[03:55 - 03:59]
preloaded this first prompt right here,

[03:57 - 04:01]
let me zoom in. There you go. I can

[03:59 - 04:04]
start working with this one. This one is

[04:01 - 04:06]
a fun example. It's an interactive map.

[04:04 - 04:08]
So, let's start reading this prompt.

[04:06 - 04:11]
Create an interactive walking tour guide

[04:08 - 04:14]
for customers of my travel agency

[04:11 - 04:16]
showcasing Sydney's most beautiful

[04:14 - 04:17]
locations within walking distance from

[04:16 - 04:19]
each other. All right. So, I'm going to

[04:17 - 04:23]
change a few things. Okay. I don't want

[04:19 - 04:25]
Sydney. I want my city, Barcelona.

[04:23 - 04:28]
Barcelona. So, create an interactive

[04:25 - 04:31]
walking tour for my visiting friends. It

[04:28 - 04:33]
doesn't matter. Visiting family members.

[04:31 - 04:35]
Okay. can delete the things. Um, what

[04:33 - 04:38]
I'm doing here is I'm tweaking the

[04:35 - 04:40]
prompt as I read it. Okay, so create an

[04:38 - 04:42]
interactive walking tour for visiting

[04:40 - 04:45]
family members showcasing Barcelona's

[04:42 - 04:47]
most beautiful locations within walking

[04:45 - 04:49]
distance of each other. Okay, the

[04:47 - 04:52]
walking tour application should include

[04:49 - 04:55]
a sleek, uncluttered map interface using

[04:52 - 04:58]
a fully working open maps implementation

[04:55 - 05:00]
with reduced visual elements. Okay.

[04:58 - 05:03]
Minimum labels, subdued colors,

[05:00 - 05:05]
simplified icons. Okay. Created roots

[05:03 - 05:08]
connecting Sydney's most stunning. Okay.

[05:05 - 05:11]
Connecting Barcelona's most stunning

[05:08 - 05:14]
locations like Okay. So, I'm going to

[05:11 - 05:17]
give a few. So, Sagada Familia. Let's

[05:14 - 05:21]
say Gaudi's

[05:17 - 05:25]
house. Okay. Hidden beaches. Okay. Maybe

[05:21 - 05:27]
famous beaches, architectural landmarks.

[05:25 - 05:29]
Let's add, etc. Location aware

[05:27 - 05:31]
functionality that highlights nearby

[05:29 - 05:33]
point of interest that are easily

[05:31 - 05:36]
walkable. That's good. Useful content

[05:33 - 05:38]
for each location like brief historical

[05:36 - 05:41]
context, local insights. Yes. Clear map

[05:38 - 05:42]
markers for each location. That's good.

[05:41 - 05:45]
All locations should be within

[05:42 - 05:48]
reasonable walking distance. Yep. So,

[05:45 - 05:50]
let's add some numbers here. Let's say 5

[05:48 - 05:52]
kilometers. That's maybe that's a bit

[05:50 - 05:55]
long. Maybe 2.5 kilometers. The user

[05:52 - 05:57]
should be able to select from a few tour

[05:55 - 06:00]
options. So that's cool. I like that.

[05:57 - 06:02]
The map design should feature a limited

[06:00 - 06:05]
color palette with subtle contrast for

[06:02 - 06:07]
path and landmarks. Okay. Elimination of

[06:05 - 06:09]
unnecessary street labels, keeping only

[06:07 - 06:12]
essential orientation information. Yes.

[06:09 - 06:14]
Custom minimal map markers that reveal

[06:12 - 06:16]
more information when clicked on. I like

[06:14 - 06:19]
that too. A zoom functionality that

[06:16 - 06:21]
gradually reveals more detail only as

[06:19 - 06:24]
needed. And before finalizing the tour

[06:21 - 06:26]
routes, please research seasonally

[06:24 - 06:28]
optimal locations. Yep. Less travel

[06:26 - 06:30]
viewpoints that offer stunning, let's

[06:28 - 06:33]
say, stunning views of the city.

[06:30 - 06:36]
Architecturally significant buildings

[06:33 - 06:39]
with noteworthy design elements, natural

[06:36 - 06:41]
features unique to Barcelona's geography

[06:39 - 06:43]
and places with cultural significance to

[06:41 - 06:45]
both indigenous and more modern city.

[06:43 - 06:46]
Okay, let's replace this entire thing

[06:45 - 06:51]
and

[06:46 - 06:52]
restaurants that serve delicious tapas.

[06:51 - 06:54]
Okay, let's just do that. Okay, that's

[06:52 - 06:57]
the end of the prompt. So, I'm going to

[06:54 - 07:00]
run this prompt and you will see Canva

[06:57 - 07:04]
is going to start like summarizing my

[07:00 - 07:06]
request and generated some code right

[07:04 - 07:09]
here on the right side of the screen. So

[07:06 - 07:12]
I have this split screen situation and I

[07:09 - 07:14]
can see some code being generated there

[07:12 - 07:16]
which I can't read. I don't know how to

[07:14 - 07:19]
code and yeah I'm very excited about

[07:16 - 07:22]
this to see like what kind of experience

[07:19 - 07:24]
I am creating right here. I'm not sure

[07:22 - 07:26]
just how long this is going to take. I

[07:24 - 07:29]
don't want to speed up the video. I want

[07:26 - 07:31]
to give you a full experience of what it

[07:29 - 07:33]
is like how long it takes to generate

[07:31 - 07:35]
such a coding project. So in the

[07:33 - 07:38]
meantime I can maybe talk a little bit

[07:35 - 07:41]
about where this might be going for

[07:38 - 07:44]
Canva like if indeed this generates an

[07:41 - 07:47]
interactive experience for me. So this

[07:44 - 07:50]
interactive map that I can then like

[07:47 - 07:52]
easily publish as a website in Canva and

[07:50 - 07:55]
then I have this URL of my interactive

[07:52 - 07:58]
map that I can share with anyone coming

[07:55 - 08:00]
to visit me right here in Barcelona and

[07:58 - 08:03]
knowing I could come back to this app

[08:00 - 08:04]
continue prompting in the same chat in

[08:03 - 08:08]
the same conversation and maybe

[08:04 - 08:10]
customize my map to provide like

[08:08 - 08:13]
customized walking tours to different

[08:10 - 08:15]
people who come and visit me. That is

[08:13 - 08:17]
pretty amazing. I mean this is for me

[08:15 - 08:21]
like walking into the future. So I think

[08:17 - 08:22]
this is a great initiative by Canva to

[08:21 - 08:25]
push the boundaries and you know when

[08:22 - 08:28]
you know that this theme of this Canva

[08:25 - 08:31]
create is uncharted territories like

[08:28 - 08:35]
unexplored territories coming up with a

[08:31 - 08:36]
feature like this is quite a ballsy move

[08:35 - 08:39]
from Canva because this is kind of

[08:36 - 08:42]
moving away quite a bit from their core

[08:39 - 08:45]
business. Okay. So it might mean okay we

[08:42 - 08:48]
are definitely an AI company. Okay we

[08:45 - 08:51]
definitely want to position our platform

[08:48 - 08:52]
as such. You come to Canva not just to

[08:51 - 08:54]
create a design anymore. You come to

[08:52 - 08:56]
Canva for anything AI. So what we are

[08:54 - 09:00]
going to do next we are going to have a

[08:56 - 09:02]
look at obviously the generated app the

[09:00 - 09:05]
generated experience that Canva has

[09:02 - 09:08]
created for us. I will try to publish

[09:05 - 09:11]
this as a website and see how it might

[09:08 - 09:14]
look from an enduser's perspective. I

[09:11 - 09:16]
hope you are enjoying this coverage that

[09:14 - 09:20]
we are making of Canva Create that you

[09:16 - 09:22]
are also discovering the other videos in

[09:20 - 09:25]
our Canva create playlist. Diana is

[09:22 - 09:27]
creating a few of these videos. If you

[09:25 - 09:30]
are enjoying this, if you are enjoying

[09:27 - 09:32]
the work we have done for covering this

[09:30 - 09:33]
event, make sure you subscribe to our

[09:32 - 09:36]
channel because we'll definitely

[09:33 - 09:39]
continue exploring these features

[09:36 - 09:41]
deeper. We will also make sure to update

[09:39 - 09:44]
our online courses about Canva. The

[09:41 - 09:46]
Canva master course on Udemy needs to be

[09:44 - 09:48]
completely rethought after so many new

[09:46 - 09:50]
announcements. Okay, so something's

[09:48 - 09:53]
going on here. Barcelona walking tour

[09:50 - 09:55]
guide. Let's see. I'd love to create an

[09:53 - 09:58]
interactive walking tour. Oh wow, look

[09:55 - 10:00]
at this. We do have our map here. Okay,

[09:58 - 10:02]
Gaudi masterpieces. That's the first

[10:00 - 10:05]
one. That's the red tour. We have the

[10:02 - 10:07]
Gothic Quarter. We have the seaside in

[10:05 - 10:09]
Barcelonetta, which is indeed the

[10:07 - 10:12]
seaside like walking tour right here.

[10:09 - 10:14]
Gothic quarter. Okay, we have a few

[10:12 - 10:16]
different things. Elcal Jewish Quarter

[10:14 - 10:19]
Plasan Jaome. Okay, let's zoom in.

[10:16 - 10:21]
Barcelona Cathedral. Oh, that's pretty

[10:19 - 10:24]
cool. So these are some of the photos

[10:21 - 10:26]
from the Canva library or from Unsplash.

[10:24 - 10:29]
I think I've seen the word Unsplash in

[10:26 - 10:32]
the code. So we do have a few photos. I

[10:29 - 10:34]
imagine these could be swapped later in

[10:32 - 10:37]
when we publish this or when we use this

[10:34 - 10:39]
in a document. But what I'm showing you

[10:37 - 10:41]
is basically when you click on any of

[10:39 - 10:43]
these points, you have more information.

[10:41 - 10:46]
One of Europe oldest Jewish quarter. So

[10:43 - 10:48]
each of these markers on the map

[10:46 - 10:50]
represent something. Okay? So we always

[10:48 - 10:53]
have the same photos but I think these

[10:50 - 10:55]
could be updated later. So let me read a

[10:53 - 10:57]
few of the things. A picturesque

[10:55 - 10:59]
medieval square surrounded by the royal

[10:57 - 11:01]
place. So all of this information is

[10:59 - 11:05]
correct, right? Okay. So here we have

[11:01 - 11:07]
one dot that is not part of the route of

[11:05 - 11:09]
the tour but that's a point of interest.

[11:07 - 11:12]
Remember we asked for adding points of

[11:09 - 11:15]
interest nearby. So this is one bodega

[11:12 - 11:17]
Juan. So traditional Catalan tavern

[11:15 - 11:19]
serving excellent tapas. Okay. So, it's

[11:17 - 11:22]
giving me the tapas thingy kind of

[11:19 - 11:24]
outside my three main walking tours

[11:22 - 11:26]
here. So, I'm very happy about this

[11:24 - 11:28]
park. Well, yes, this is another one.

[11:26 - 11:31]
Okay. So, I have some other photos,

[11:28 - 11:33]
placeholders. This one doesn't display

[11:31 - 11:35]
all of the photos, but I have the same

[11:33 - 11:37]
amount of placeholders. And I have some

[11:35 - 11:40]
information, okay, with some tags. This

[11:37 - 11:42]
is pretty cool. Like, this is literally

[11:40 - 11:45]
generated out of this prompt that I

[11:42 - 11:46]
showed you. And the nice thing is that

[11:45 - 11:49]
you see I have this result. This is

[11:46 - 11:52]
version one. I could ask it to add a

[11:49 - 11:54]
tour about anything else. So, I'm going

[11:52 - 11:56]
to ask this one thing. I'm going to use

[11:54 - 12:00]
the voice command. This is great. Can

[11:56 - 12:04]
you add a fourth walking tour that will

[12:00 - 12:06]
focus on the best pastry shops in

[12:04 - 12:08]
Barcelona? Okay. So, I'm going to go

[12:06 - 12:10]
with this. I'm going to delete the Okay,

[12:08 - 12:12]
I'm going to launch this. So, while it's

[12:10 - 12:14]
doing that, I'll come back to it later.

[12:12 - 12:17]
I opened a second tab right here on my

[12:14 - 12:20]
browser and I am again in the Canva AI

[12:17 - 12:23]
code for me section. I want to show you

[12:20 - 12:26]
by clicking on this menu here to open

[12:23 - 12:29]
the chat history. A few other things I

[12:26 - 12:31]
played around with. So this one right

[12:29 - 12:33]
here is our itinerary walking tour. So

[12:31 - 12:37]
that's the one I'm coding in the other

[12:33 - 12:40]
tab. But I also created a dynamic

[12:37 - 12:42]
timeline that retraces the career of

[12:40 - 12:44]
Michael Jordan. This one was pretty

[12:42 - 12:46]
amazing as well. And my prompt for this

[12:44 - 12:49]
one was create an interactive timeline

[12:46 - 12:51]
about Michael Jordan's MJ life and

[12:49 - 12:54]
career. Include the following chapters

[12:51 - 12:56]
to MJ's life. And then I pasted like a

[12:54 - 12:58]
few things like, you know, kind of like

[12:56 - 13:01]
similar to the chapters of The Last

[12:58 - 13:03]
Dance, the documentary about Michael

[13:01 - 13:06]
Jordan on Netflix. And I didn't give it

[13:03 - 13:08]
too much context, like maybe five or six

[13:06 - 13:11]
or seven bullet points. And it came back

[13:08 - 13:13]
with this really cool timeline right

[13:11 - 13:15]
here. You see Michael Jordan, the

[13:13 - 13:17]
journey of a legend. Explore the

[13:15 - 13:20]
timeline. Six NBA championship, five MVP

[13:17 - 13:23]
awards, 10 scoring title, etc., etc. Let

[13:20 - 13:26]
me zoom out a little bit so you can see

[13:23 - 13:29]
more. Then I have all of the eras or

[13:26 - 13:30]
different stages of MJ's career. You see

[13:29 - 13:33]
this is the beginning. So the early

[13:30 - 13:38]
years, the making of a legend. So since

[13:33 - 13:40]
his birth, I imagine 1963 to 1984. So it

[13:38 - 13:43]
gave me a really detailed timeline of

[13:40 - 13:45]
Michael Jordan's life with some nice

[13:43 - 13:48]
graphics here that represents kind of

[13:45 - 13:51]
like the most important events in his

[13:48 - 13:54]
life. And in that period of his life, a

[13:51 - 13:56]
photo gallery where I can add some

[13:54 - 13:59]
photos, I imagine. And then we move on

[13:56 - 14:01]
to the second chapter of MJ's life, the

[13:59 - 14:03]
rookie season, a glimpse of greatness

[14:01 - 14:05]
with again more stuff, some stats. So

[14:03 - 14:07]
that's pretty cool. Like really, really

[14:05 - 14:09]
cool timeline, Michael Jordan's brand,

[14:07 - 14:11]
Cultural Impact, the Air Jordan brand,

[14:09 - 14:14]
Space Jam, like all the stuff that he

[14:11 - 14:15]
did aside from basketball. So I was

[14:14 - 14:17]
really, really surprised. Now,

[14:15 - 14:20]
obviously, the design is not

[14:17 - 14:23]
particularly amazing. I can publish this

[14:20 - 14:26]
as a website if I want to. I haven't yet

[14:23 - 14:28]
found the way to really customize this

[14:26 - 14:30]
in my Canva design. So, this is the

[14:28 - 14:32]
Canva design experience. Okay, let me

[14:30 - 14:34]
zoom out a bit. I don't know how to

[14:32 - 14:36]
change the font, for example. It seems

[14:34 - 14:38]
like it's coded and it's kind of

[14:36 - 14:41]
embedded in my document. But I cannot

[14:38 - 14:43]
come and simply, you know, go to my

[14:41 - 14:45]
elements, find some photos, and just

[14:43 - 14:48]
drop them here. You see, I'm not able to

[14:45 - 14:49]
drop anything on that experience. Like

[14:48 - 14:51]
for example here, I'd love to add a

[14:49 - 14:54]
banner. And I don't know how to do this.

[14:51 - 14:56]
So it doesn't seem like I can open and

[14:54 - 14:58]
close these sections, these chapters on

[14:56 - 15:00]
my website. These buttons, they don't

[14:58 - 15:03]
really do much. But I could continue

[15:00 - 15:06]
coding. And I believe there is a way to

[15:03 - 15:08]
include in the code the images. But what

[15:06 - 15:10]
would be really amazing is that once

[15:08 - 15:12]
it's coded, once it's right there in my

[15:10 - 15:15]
Canva document, that it becomes an

[15:12 - 15:17]
editable document. I mean, that would be

[15:15 - 15:19]
really amazing. I imagine this is where

[15:17 - 15:22]
we are going but I haven't yet been able

[15:19 - 15:24]
to figure it out. Okay, I haven't played

[15:22 - 15:26]
around too much with this but I think

[15:24 - 15:28]
this is where we are going and I think

[15:26 - 15:30]
this is a very powerful experience. All

[15:28 - 15:33]
right, I want to show you a few other

[15:30 - 15:35]
things I have worked on with Canva code

[15:33 - 15:38]
yesterday while testing this. So if you

[15:35 - 15:40]
want to access your historic of

[15:38 - 15:43]
conversations, you need to make sure you

[15:40 - 15:44]
are on the right feature in my case is

[15:43 - 15:46]
code for me because otherwise you will

[15:44 - 15:48]
see something else here. You will see

[15:46 - 15:51]
probably what you have designed with

[15:48 - 15:53]
canva. So design for me but if you click

[15:51 - 15:55]
on code for me you see these will

[15:53 - 15:59]
change. Okay. So the one I want to show

[15:55 - 16:01]
you is the learn Canva with team Rondi

[15:59 - 16:04]
experience. So I started this project

[16:01 - 16:06]
like this. create a clean landing page

[16:04 - 16:08]
that features a learning path made out

[16:06 - 16:10]
of three YouTube videos. The landing

[16:08 - 16:12]
page will have embeds of the three

[16:10 - 16:14]
YouTube videos and then I paste the URLs

[16:12 - 16:16]
of these three videos. At the top of the

[16:14 - 16:19]
landing page, we can read the title

[16:16 - 16:21]
learn Canva with team Rond. And at the

[16:19 - 16:24]
bottom of the page, a pink and then I

[16:21 - 16:26]
gave the color of that pink button with

[16:24 - 16:29]
white letters in Monserat extra bold

[16:26 - 16:31]
saying subscribe to our channel and this

[16:29 - 16:33]
button leads to this URL. So this is

[16:31 - 16:35]
kind of like the direct subscribe link

[16:33 - 16:39]
to our channel. So I tried to make an

[16:35 - 16:41]
onbrand landing page featuring three of

[16:39 - 16:44]
our YouTube videos, a subscribe button

[16:41 - 16:47]
that looks and feel like our brand, like

[16:44 - 16:50]
our pink and our font to kind of promote

[16:47 - 16:52]
some of my tutorials. And so the last

[16:50 - 16:55]
version of it was this. So it looks

[16:52 - 16:57]
great, like learn Canva with team Rondi,

[16:55 - 16:58]
master Canva with our step-by-step

[16:57 - 17:01]
learning path designed to take you from

[16:58 - 17:03]
beginner to pro. So this I didn't

[17:01 - 17:06]
instruct it to create that subtitle. It

[17:03 - 17:08]
invented by the AI. So your learning

[17:06 - 17:10]
path, the first tutorial, okay, this one

[17:08 - 17:12]
right here, getting started with Canva.

[17:10 - 17:14]
This is not the title. So this one is

[17:12 - 17:17]
not the correct title and description

[17:14 - 17:20]
for this first video. Second and third.

[17:17 - 17:23]
So these three thumbnails are correct.

[17:20 - 17:25]
The description is not. But the issue is

[17:23 - 17:27]
that these never worked. You see, I got

[17:25 - 17:29]
an error message. YouTube is blocked.

[17:27 - 17:31]
the button as well, the subscribe

[17:29 - 17:34]
button, never got it to work and that

[17:31 - 17:36]
that this is version six. So, I really

[17:34 - 17:39]
tried to make this work. It never

[17:36 - 17:42]
happened. But, I mean, we got to this

[17:39 - 17:46]
point, right? We coded an entire thing.

[17:42 - 17:49]
I imagine it's something relatively easy

[17:46 - 17:51]
to fix because I'm not a coder. And also

[17:49 - 17:53]
very important because Canva doesn't

[17:51 - 17:54]
give me access to the code. So, that's

[17:53 - 17:56]
an important thing you need to know.

[17:54 - 17:58]
Like I tried I asked it okay show me the

[17:56 - 18:00]
code like I'm going to fix it you know

[17:58 - 18:02]
no I didn't get this at first and I

[18:00 - 18:04]
never got to the code part. So Canva

[18:02 - 18:06]
doesn't show you the code or it shows

[18:04 - 18:08]
you the code for an instant and then it

[18:06 - 18:11]
switches to the actual output. So I

[18:08 - 18:13]
cannot access the exact code and go and

[18:11 - 18:15]
fix it like if I know exactly what I'm

[18:13 - 18:17]
doing like just fix this line of code.

[18:15 - 18:18]
This is not happening at least not right

[18:17 - 18:21]
now. So that's one of the limitations of

[18:18 - 18:24]
the tool as of today. Now I think our

[18:21 - 18:27]
map should be ready. You see this one?

[18:24 - 18:29]
Sweet Barcelona. Okay. Let's see. We

[18:27 - 18:31]
have a few different spots. Okay.

[18:29 - 18:33]
Baloir. This one is one that I know.

[18:31 - 18:36]
Okay. With some nice croissant and

[18:33 - 18:39]
pastry photos. Okay. So, sweet Barcelona

[18:36 - 18:40]
pastry tour. Indulge your sweet tooth on

[18:39 - 18:42]
this delightful tour of Barcelona's

[18:40 - 18:45]
finest pastry shops and bakeries. From

[18:42 - 18:47]
traditional Catalan treats to innovative

[18:45 - 18:50]
modern confections. Discover the city's

[18:47 - 18:52]
rich pastry heritage. Okay, let's see if

[18:50 - 18:54]
these locations are correct. Baloir.

[18:52 - 18:56]
Definitely. I know it. Barcelonetta. I

[18:54 - 18:57]
know exactly where that is. It's a

[18:56 - 18:59]
coffee

[18:57 - 19:03]
shop/croissant pastry. So, yes. Let's

[18:59 - 19:05]
see some of these. Pateria laa. This is

[19:03 - 19:07]
one of my favorite one. Best chocolate

[19:05 - 19:10]
croissant in Barcelona in my opinion.

[19:07 - 19:12]
This one. Kyum. This one. I don't know.

[19:10 - 19:15]
Kyum unique tea room. Okay. Oh, yeah. I

[19:12 - 19:17]
see which one it's Yep. Essa. This one.

[19:15 - 19:19]
Bruners. Yeah. Another famous croissant

[19:17 - 19:21]
shop in Barcelona. So, guys, I think

[19:19 - 19:24]
this works. The line here is a little

[19:21 - 19:26]
bit broken, but I kind of see the point,

[19:24 - 19:29]
right? I kind of know where to go from

[19:26 - 19:31]
one location to the other. These

[19:29 - 19:33]
Huffman, also very famous, award-winning

[19:31 - 19:35]
pastry shop run by prestigious Huffman

[19:33 - 19:37]
Culinary School. Yes, know from the

[19:35 - 19:39]
exquisite Mascar pony croissants and

[19:37 - 19:42]
creative seasonal pastry. So, this is a

[19:39 - 19:44]
success, guys. You see, I can share

[19:42 - 19:46]
that. Wonder what happens if I click

[19:44 - 19:49]
here. Nothing happens right now. Find my

[19:46 - 19:51]
location using a design. Okay. I'm

[19:49 - 19:53]
curious to see if I use this in a

[19:51 - 19:56]
design. Okay, so I have created this.

[19:53 - 19:58]
This is a website design. I guess I want

[19:56 - 20:00]
to publish this. Okay, how do I publish

[19:58 - 20:03]
this? Include navigation menu website

[20:00 - 20:05]
URL. Publish my website. Okay, it's

[20:03 - 20:07]
preparing the website. Okay, I have a

[20:05 - 20:11]
URL. Let's view the website first on

[20:07 - 20:13]
desktop. Okay, this looks great on the

[20:11 - 20:16]
desktop. So this one is the seaside.

[20:13 - 20:18]
Yes, we have W Hotel, Portville,

[20:16 - 20:21]
Barcelonetta. Yes, Gothic Quarter right

[20:18 - 20:23]
here. I can zoom in with my mouse. I

[20:21 - 20:25]
just use the wheel on my mouse. So,

[20:23 - 20:27]
that's pretty cool. All right, I have a

[20:25 - 20:28]
find my location. Don't want to use it.

[20:27 - 20:31]
I don't want to let everybody know

[20:28 - 20:33]
exactly where I live, but I imagine this

[20:31 - 20:36]
works. All right, this looked great on

[20:33 - 20:38]
desktop. Now, I want to test this on a

[20:36 - 20:40]
mobile device. Okay. All right. So, let

[20:38 - 20:43]
me grab my phone. I'm going to paste

[20:40 - 20:45]
that URL that should be copied in my

[20:43 - 20:48]
clipboard. There you go. There's my

[20:45 - 20:50]
Canvas site. And there you go. This

[20:48 - 20:52]
looks pretty good even on my mobile

[20:50 - 20:54]
phone. So this is the Gaudi

[20:52 - 20:57]
masterpieces. Let's go for the sweet

[20:54 - 21:00]
Barcelona. So now I can zoom in, still

[20:57 - 21:02]
move the map. I can tap on the

[21:00 - 21:04]
locations. All right. So this one is

[21:02 - 21:06]
Esca Barcelona institution blah blah

[21:04 - 21:09]
blah. All right. So this works

[21:06 - 21:13]
perfectly. Wow. I am a little bit like

[21:09 - 21:15]
still under shock of how cool this

[21:13 - 21:18]
experience was. Like this map is

[21:15 - 21:21]
probably the best project I have coded

[21:18 - 21:23]
with Canva. Canva has coded for me. This

[21:21 - 21:25]
slide right here shows you a bit more of

[21:23 - 21:27]
what we can do. Interactive elements. So

[21:25 - 21:30]
I guess we could create simple

[21:27 - 21:32]
animations for your landing pages for

[21:30 - 21:35]
your Canva website. Calculators. I have

[21:32 - 21:37]
created a simple package calculator.

[21:35 - 21:39]
That was actually the first project I

[21:37 - 21:41]
tried when I tried Canva code for the

[21:39 - 21:43]
first time. Educational games. This one

[21:41 - 21:45]
I haven't tried. Interactive maps. I

[21:43 - 21:47]
showed you one countdown timers. I

[21:45 - 21:50]
didn't try this one, but it seems pretty

[21:47 - 21:52]
straightforward. SMB Ice Breakers

[21:50 - 21:54]
Educational Escape Rooms. This one I

[21:52 - 21:56]
haven't tried either. And I've seen

[21:54 - 21:59]
other people I've seen another Canva

[21:56 - 22:02]
expert, Ludo, who teaches Canva in

[21:59 - 22:03]
French coding a Tetris game that worked.

[22:02 - 22:05]
So, that was pretty amazing, too. So,

[22:03 - 22:08]
it's really up to you and your

[22:05 - 22:10]
creativity. What you see here is a few

[22:08 - 22:12]
actual use cases. So for marketing

[22:10 - 22:15]
teams, gamified campaigns, or you could

[22:12 - 22:18]
have like scratchable like discover

[22:15 - 22:21]
coupons or like a spinning wheel kind of

[22:18 - 22:23]
contest for sales product customizers.

[22:21 - 22:26]
Okay, so you could really like create an

[22:23 - 22:29]
app that customizes a specific product

[22:26 - 22:32]
experience for creative people. digital

[22:29 - 22:35]
activations, design animated interactive

[22:32 - 22:37]
brand experiences for pitches, events,

[22:35 - 22:40]
client presentations, small businesses,

[22:37 - 22:42]
pricing and quote calculators, so your

[22:40 - 22:44]
different packages, how much it would

[22:42 - 22:46]
cost to work with you on in such and

[22:44 - 22:49]
such and such a way. And obviously for

[22:46 - 22:51]
education or teachers, learning games,

[22:49 - 22:55]
learning activities like vocabulary

[22:51 - 22:58]
quizzes and stuff like that. So I highly

[22:55 - 23:01]
highly encourage you to get familiar

[22:58 - 23:04]
with this technology. Vibe coding is a

[23:01 - 23:08]
thing. Canva is demonstrating that by

[23:04 - 23:10]
making it available to its 225 million

[23:08 - 23:13]
users, it's going to be a thing, you

[23:10 - 23:16]
know. So the sooner you learn to

[23:13 - 23:18]
communicate with the AI to create all

[23:16 - 23:21]
sorts of experiences, the better. And I

[23:18 - 23:23]
can clearly see how this lays the

[23:21 - 23:25]
foundation for something really

[23:23 - 23:28]
extraordinary when we will be able to

[23:25 - 23:30]
grab that piece of code, dump it in a

[23:28 - 23:31]
document and start customizing, you

know, changing the text, changing the

[23:31 - 23:36]
fonts, changing the colors, changing the

[23:34 - 23:38]
photos, and then publish that as an

[23:36 - 23:40]
experience, as a website, as an app.

[23:38 - 23:43]
There's really no limit to what we can

[23:40 - 23:46]
do. This was Canva Code. It's a premium

[23:43 - 23:48]
feature, so it will use credits and

[23:46 - 23:50]
you've got to try it. And that's it for

[23:48 - 23:52]
this one. In the next video of our Canva

[23:50 - 23:54]
Create playlist, Diana and I are going

[23:52 - 23:57]
to cover a few of the wishes, the

[23:54 - 23:59]
community wishes that Canva has granted.

[23:57 - 24:02]
So, we'll cover a bunch of other new

[23:59 - 24:02]
features in this

*I'm EXCITED for ALL THE NEW DROPS! The only thing I've been trying to figure out is how to take my ALREADY existing creations and put them all in one document with the different sizes. I'll be spending the rest of the week getting EVERYTHING organized and streamlined.*

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 0): I guess for now that will be copying/pasting from one doc to the other ü•∏

Thanks so much for your very informative and timely videos on the latest canva create event! There‚Äôs so much in the update that it‚Äôs hard to get my head around it, but your videos have made it so much easier to take it in and start playing with it. Thanks again

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 0): Awesome!
We tried our best to give you guys a comprehensive view of what was released. 
More videos coming soon, both here and in our Canva Master Course on Udemy, to dive deeper into all of this.

### 7. @Celph (üëç 3)
How do you have access this feature? is it only not available in the USA yet?

### 8. @AishaGlenn-bracey (üëç 5)
I‚Äôve had issues when I go to add extra info to have it edit pieces, things become non functional but other than this, it‚Äôs amazing. I just hope they allow us to edit the design eventually to make it on brand

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 0): Same, I‚Äôm sure their plan is to do so. Let‚Äôs give it some time!

### 9. @sal4gal (üëç 0)
Thank you!  Your video makes me excited to test this.

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 0): Have fun!

### 10. @Loki2017nov (üëç 11)
I used an interactive historical timeline but couldn't incorporate it into the design because it doesn't cover all the pages and isn't clickable. One more thing: why can't we download the results of coddling instead of coding itself?  Could you make a video about that?

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 6): You are right, we can't access the code for now ... I don't know if Canva will change that in the future. 
And yes, we'll create more tutorials about Canva Code soon üòé

### 11. @elori21136 (üëç 1)
I am having the same issue with editing the website created in Canva Code. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me! Just a limitation. I only wish I didn‚Äôt waste a couple hours trying to figure it out‚Ä¶

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 3): Orrrr... you could look at it this way: 
Canva is not going to stop there with this product ... it's only gonna get better. So you've invested a few hours fiddling with the tool in its early days. This will eventually pay off üòé

### 12. @PCJISNOW17 (üëç 1)
Really cool! Will def need to test it. When it comes to making apps do you know if they actually come out as an ‚Äúapp‚Äù like you could publish on an App Store or is it just like a website that looks like an app?

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 1): It‚Äôs more like widgets or interactive design elements. Not something you can publish on the App Store üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

> **@gamwsas** (üëç 0): @@TeamRonDi how can i publish it as an app?

### 13. @MartavanEckDesigns (üëç 1)
How can i reuse the code and copy it for my own website? I get ready design but how can i get just the html code?

### 14. @soneaf (üëç 1)
Ok I am so happy you posted this video. I had ALL the same issues you are having actually using the code and or designs or side of Canva (minus websites)  . So are we just trying this out for Canva so they can see what works and doesnt work cause at this time I do not see the point of this.

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 0): It's an early release, so yes, pretty much. 
That's how most AI companies do nowadays. They ship and then fix.

### 15. @jugandbrew (üëç 1)
Your explanations are perfect; however please enlarge your cursor so people who have a visual impairment can track where the cursor is pointing.

> **@TeamRonDi** (üëç 0): Will try to accommodate that.

### 16. @sandhaninc (üëç 0)
I'm thinking that in order to swap fonts or add headers/ images etc you might be able to ask that in the prompt??

### 17. @davidlaryea873 (üëç 0)
It's a wonderful feature. But its like if i want to add more stuff to the web application, there is no history section for the code AI so i can update the website

### 18. @sandhaninc (üëç 1)
How lucky you are... it's being released gradually and I haven't got it yet üò•

### 19. @khedleytw (üëç 0)
Wow, cant wait to play with this one!üéâ

### 20. @andrewlee3625 (üëç 0)
Can I set up cloud database linkage to save data from the app that Canva AI coding create?  How to do it?  Any advice?
