[00:00 - 00:03]
i've dedicated the last three years of

[00:01 - 00:05]
my life teaching millions of people how

[00:03 - 00:09]
to use AI and if I had to leave you with

[00:05 - 00:11]
one must-learn skill in 2025 2026 and

[00:09 - 00:13]
beyond it would be prompt engineering

[00:11 - 00:15]
prompt engineering single-handedly has

[00:13 - 00:17]
changed my life knowing how to ask

[00:15 - 00:19]
questions to a language model and give

[00:17 - 00:22]
commands is something that has allowed

[00:19 - 00:24]
me to increase my intellectual capacity

[00:22 - 00:25]
it's allowed me to build a sevenfigure

[00:24 - 00:27]
brand a lot quicker than I would have

[00:25 - 00:30]
without it and it's allowed me to save

[00:27 - 00:32]
literally weeks of my life just knowing

[00:30 - 00:33]
how to ask the right questions and give

[00:32 - 00:35]
the right commands that's what I'm here

[00:33 - 00:38]
to show you today is how to get started

[00:35 - 00:40]
in becoming a prompt engineer so today

[00:38 - 00:42]
I'm going to walk through seven steps

[00:40 - 00:44]
with you in order to help you become

[00:42 - 00:46]
better at prompt engineering now this is

[00:44 - 00:47]
something that takes time practice and

[00:46 - 00:50]
working through multiple projects in

[00:47 - 00:52]
order to master and in order to perfect

[00:50 - 00:54]
but before we get into it a little bit

[00:52 - 00:56]
more about me my name is Drake i run a

[00:54 - 00:58]
community on the school platform called

[00:56 - 01:00]
AI foundations you may see school

[00:58 - 01:03]
bouncing around we were one of the first

[01:00 - 01:05]
communities for AI to start doing it and

[01:03 - 01:08]
uh we're one of the best and it shows we

[01:05 - 01:10]
have over 1,400 students and a lot of

[01:08 - 01:12]
our students are doing some pretty cool

[01:10 - 01:13]
things like getting a bunch of clients

[01:12 - 01:16]
from what they're learning in the

[01:13 - 01:19]
classroom and some other people are even

[01:16 - 01:21]
uh landing jobs at Apple uh Jonathan

[01:19 - 01:24]
here became an analyst at Apple thanks

[01:21 - 01:26]
to what he's learned in this community

[01:24 - 01:28]
and in the classroom we teach all about

[01:26 - 01:31]
prompt engineering why it's important

[01:28 - 01:34]
and a full guide on how to master it and

[01:31 - 01:36]
not only that but AI images AI audio AI

[01:34 - 01:38]
video and AI agent building this is the

[01:36 - 01:40]
spot to be for artificial intelligence

[01:38 - 01:41]
from beginner to master if you want to

[01:40 - 01:43]
join I'll leave a link in the

[01:41 - 01:45]
description and the top pinned comment

[01:43 - 01:47]
and now let's get into these seven

[01:45 - 01:49]
prompt engineering tips that will help

[01:47 - 01:50]
take you from a beginner and get you up

[01:49 - 01:53]
to speed on the direction that you need

[01:50 - 01:55]
to go in order to start using prompt

[01:53 - 01:58]
engineering to its full capabilities now

[01:55 - 02:01]
the first spot I always like to begin is

[01:58 - 02:04]
what is a prompt well a prompt is any

[02:01 - 02:06]
question or command typed into a large

[02:04 - 02:08]
language model so when I'm telling you

[02:06 - 02:11]
that you need to refine your prompt and

[02:08 - 02:13]
that you need to prompt chat GBT or

[02:11 - 02:14]
claude or any large language model in a

[02:13 - 02:17]
certain way this is what I'm talking

[02:14 - 02:19]
about the ability to ask it questions in

[02:17 - 02:21]
here in the prompt bar you can ask it

[02:19 - 02:23]
all sorts of questions this thing has a

[02:21 - 02:25]
plethora of information and it's all at

[02:23 - 02:27]
your fingertips if you aren't using a

[02:25 - 02:29]
large language model at least two to

[02:27 - 02:31]
three times a day then you're definitely

[02:29 - 02:33]
not maxing out the potential of what

[02:31 - 02:35]
your life could be so reframe your mind

[02:33 - 02:38]
and try to put yourself in the mind of a

[02:35 - 02:40]
philosopher one who is always asking

[02:38 - 02:42]
questions about anything in life it

[02:40 - 02:45]
doesn't have to be anything crazy either

[02:42 - 02:47]
it could be about everyday things you

[02:45 - 02:49]
can become much more intellectually

[02:47 - 02:51]
capable while just using this on a

[02:49 - 02:53]
day-to-day basis about anything you want

[02:51 - 02:54]
step number one falls within the prompt

[02:53 - 02:57]
engineering hierarchy that I've built

[02:54 - 02:59]
here first we need to define a clear

[02:57 - 03:01]
goal so tip number one is define your

[02:59 - 03:03]
goal now this does not go for every

[03:01 - 03:05]
single question and every single command

[03:03 - 03:07]
that you give to a language model but

[03:05 - 03:09]
anytime you're doing a big project you

[03:07 - 03:10]
need to have a clear goal if you don't

[03:09 - 03:12]
know what you want it's going to be very

[03:10 - 03:15]
difficult giving the large language

[03:12 - 03:18]
model direction into the result that you

[03:15 - 03:20]
want so first know what you want and

[03:18 - 03:22]
I've got a Google doc that I'm going to

[03:20 - 03:25]
give you for free in order to help you

[03:22 - 03:27]
define a clear goal so I'll leave this

[03:25 - 03:29]
in the description below but today we're

[03:27 - 03:31]
going to be using smart goals for tip

[03:29 - 03:33]
number one in order to define clearly

[03:31 - 03:35]
what is the objective that we are after

[03:33 - 03:38]
smart goals were created in 1981 by a

[03:35 - 03:40]
man named George T doran who recognized

[03:38 - 03:42]
that many business objectives lacked

[03:40 - 03:44]
clarity and focus making them

[03:42 - 03:46]
ineffective in driving real results and

[03:44 - 03:49]
that's a fact whether you're using this

[03:46 - 03:52]
for business or personal life use cases

[03:49 - 03:54]
you need to clearly define what your

[03:52 - 03:56]
goal is with direct focus and that's

[03:54 - 03:57]
what smart goals allows us to do smart

[03:56 - 03:59]
is actually an acronym that we're going

[03:57 - 04:01]
to get into later but this is a good

[03:59 - 04:02]
project to do without the help of AI a

[04:01 - 04:04]
lot of people tell me just to put this

[04:02 - 04:08]
in an agent or a GPT to define the goal

[04:04 - 04:09]
for us but my answer to that is no if

[04:08 - 04:11]
you can't define the goal yourself then

[04:09 - 04:13]
your project will be in shambles goals

[04:11 - 04:16]
and ideas are very different you should

[04:13 - 04:18]
use LLM to help you brainstorm ideas and

[04:16 - 04:20]
get those creative juices flowing but

[04:18 - 04:22]
not to define goals of projects or plans

[04:20 - 04:23]
that could potentially change your life

[04:22 - 04:25]
so let's keep scrolling down to the

[04:23 - 04:27]
smart goals table template that I want

[04:25 - 04:29]
you to fill out before starting the rest

[04:27 - 04:31]
of this video because we're going to

[04:29 - 04:33]
keep referencing this as we move on

[04:31 - 04:35]
through the next four to five tips so

[04:33 - 04:38]
SMART is an acronym for specific

[04:35 - 04:40]
measurable achievable relevant and time

[04:38 - 04:42]
bound that is the acronym that we're

[04:40 - 04:44]
using so I've given you guiding

[04:42 - 04:46]
questions to base your answers on and

[04:44 - 04:49]
you need kind of a northstar vision you

[04:46 - 04:52]
know why are you doing what you want to

[04:49 - 04:55]
do why are you going to chat GPT or

[04:52 - 04:57]
Claude or any language model in order to

[04:55 - 04:59]
get an answer what's your northstar goal

[04:57 - 05:02]
maybe my northstar goal is to educate

[04:59 - 05:05]
100,000 students about artificial

[05:02 - 05:07]
intelligence and maybe I want to set a

[05:05 - 05:10]
90-day objective on how I can get closer

[05:07 - 05:12]
to reaching that what I can do is I can

[05:10 - 05:14]
hit file and then I can go to make a

[05:12 - 05:15]
copy and once you copy this to your

[05:14 - 05:18]
workspace you can fill out your answers

[05:15 - 05:20]
here in order to first define a goal now

[05:18 - 05:22]
think of any goal you want in order to

[05:20 - 05:24]
follow along and use it as a test

[05:22 - 05:26]
example it could be a health goal it

[05:24 - 05:27]
could be you know maybe you want to drop

[05:26 - 05:30]
some pounds maybe you want to gain some

[05:27 - 05:32]
muscle maybe you want to run a marathon

[05:30 - 05:34]
maybe you want to clean your house and

[05:32 - 05:36]
you need a spot to start um whatever

[05:34 - 05:38]
goal you have in mind go down to the

[05:36 - 05:40]
description copy this and then make a

[05:38 - 05:42]
copy to your own workspace so you can

[05:40 - 05:44]
actually edit this let me show you an

[05:42 - 05:46]
example of what it might look like when

[05:44 - 05:48]
it's filled out maybe my northstar goal

[05:46 - 05:50]
like I said is educating 100,000

[05:48 - 05:53]
students about AI but beneath here I

[05:50 - 05:55]
want to set a shorter 90-day goal to

[05:53 - 05:56]
progress to a certain member count as

[05:55 - 05:57]
you can see right now in the AI

[05:56 - 06:02]
Foundations community we have about

[05:57 - 06:04]
1,400 members maybe I want to get 2,000

[06:02 - 06:06]
in 90 days not 2,000 new members but

[06:04 - 06:08]
maybe I want to get the actual number to

[06:06 - 06:12]
2,000 that way I can get closer to my

[06:08 - 06:14]
100,000 students educated about AI from

[06:12 - 06:16]
AI Foundation's community i can get more

[06:14 - 06:18]
specific about that if I want so here

[06:16 - 06:21]
we're getting specific about what I want

[06:18 - 06:22]
using the S in smart i want 601 new

[06:21 - 06:25]
members to join AI Foundation's

[06:22 - 06:26]
community in the next 90 days how will I

[06:25 - 06:29]
track progress or know it's done this is

[06:26 - 06:31]
the M of the acronym i say I will track

[06:29 - 06:33]
my progress by going to the metric tab

[06:31 - 06:35]
on school once per week when the member

[06:33 - 06:36]
count reaches 2,00 we will know it's

[06:35 - 06:39]
complete didn't even mean to rhyme there

[06:36 - 06:42]
but that's pretty sweet the next element

[06:39 - 06:44]
that we need to discover is achievable

[06:42 - 06:46]
is this realistic given my resources and

[06:44 - 06:49]
time i have this YouTube channel it's a

[06:46 - 06:50]
huge resource so yes this is achievable

[06:49 - 06:52]
we will need to gain six new members per

[06:50 - 06:54]
day as you can see I'm being very

[06:52 - 06:56]
specific about what I need to do in

[06:54 - 06:58]
order to achieve this goal does this

[06:56 - 07:00]
align with my long-term vision does

[06:58 - 07:02]
getting 600 new members in the next 90

[07:00 - 07:06]
days align with my northstar goal of

[07:02 - 07:08]
getting 100,000 students absolutely now

[07:06 - 07:10]
what's the deadline well 90 days from

[07:08 - 07:12]
now it's Saturday July 5th so that would

[07:10 - 07:15]
be my deadline so this is how you define

[07:12 - 07:17]
a goal you need a system in place you

[07:15 - 07:18]
need to start thinking in systems and

[07:17 - 07:20]
you need to first define your goal

[07:18 - 07:22]
before you try explaining to AI to help

[07:20 - 07:24]
you with your goal so this is great

[07:22 - 07:26]
we've completed step one we've defined a

[07:24 - 07:28]
clear goal and that's probably one of

[07:26 - 07:31]
the most important steps because it sets

[07:28 - 07:33]
you up for the next three items but

[07:31 - 07:37]
remember we are using the uh SMART

[07:33 - 07:39]
acronym for completing and defining what

[07:37 - 07:41]
our goal truly is and now we can start

[07:39 - 07:44]
getting into prompting because what we

[07:41 - 07:47]
need to do next is we need to create a

[07:44 - 07:50]
role around the goal now I keep rhyming

[07:47 - 07:52]
on accident but you get the point we

[07:50 - 07:54]
need to create a role for the goal so

[07:52 - 07:56]
let's get into creating a role and what

[07:54 - 07:59]
that might look like in something like

[07:56 - 08:02]
chat GBT so if I want chat GBT to get in

[07:59 - 08:03]
the shoes of someone an expert and start

[08:02 - 08:05]
thinking like an expert if you think

[08:03 - 08:07]
about it chat GBT is like a digital

[08:05 - 08:09]
brain that we have access to for the

[08:07 - 08:11]
first time it behaves similar to how the

[08:09 - 08:13]
neural networks behave in our brain and

[08:11 - 08:16]
it picks up on word patterns so it's

[08:13 - 08:18]
like you're accessing a brain online a

[08:16 - 08:21]
digital brain this is absolutely insane

[08:18 - 08:22]
if you're not taking advantage of this I

[08:21 - 08:24]
don't know what to tell you but you need

[08:22 - 08:26]
to start taking advantage of this so how

[08:24 - 08:29]
do we want this brain to think if you

[08:26 - 08:31]
could change your mindset to help you

[08:29 - 08:33]
accomplish your goal what would you

[08:31 - 08:35]
change your mindset to what job role

[08:33 - 08:36]
would you put your brain in if you could

[08:35 - 08:38]
tell yourself to act like somebody in

[08:36 - 08:40]
order to help you get to where you want

[08:38 - 08:42]
to be who would you tell yourself to act

[08:40 - 08:43]
like how would you change your brain

[08:42 - 08:45]
chemistry in order to help you

[08:43 - 08:46]
accomplish your goal these are the

[08:45 - 08:48]
questions you need to think of in tip

[08:46 - 08:50]
number two because that's what you're

[08:48 - 08:53]
going to be giving a large language

[08:50 - 08:55]
model is a role so role creation is

[08:53 - 08:57]
absolutely crucial in prompt engineering

[08:55 - 08:58]
and that's what we need to do right now

[08:57 - 09:00]
and the thing I love about role

[08:58 - 09:02]
prompting is you can get as specific as

[09:00 - 09:04]
you want using AI so I'm telling it you

[09:02 - 09:06]
are a professional school community

[09:04 - 09:08]
growth expert with years of experience

[09:06 - 09:10]
in growing online digital communities

[09:08 - 09:12]
quickly i probably don't need to put

[09:10 - 09:14]
digital after online it's a little

[09:12 - 09:16]
repetitive so in growing online

[09:14 - 09:19]
communities quickly this is perfect and

[09:16 - 09:20]
after you have your role prompted out

[09:19 - 09:23]
you're basically just giving it a

[09:20 - 09:25]
profession to fill the shoes of you can

[09:23 - 09:27]
make up a profession or you can just do

[09:25 - 09:29]
an actual profession right out of the

[09:27 - 09:32]
gate so this isn't really a profession a

[09:29 - 09:34]
school community growth expert i mean it

[09:32 - 09:36]
could be but I'm kind of making that up

[09:34 - 09:39]
i'm trying to put chat GBT in the shoes

[09:36 - 09:40]
of what that person would be doing so

[09:39 - 09:42]
now before I even send off the prompt

[09:40 - 09:45]
it's already reframing the way that it's

[09:42 - 09:47]
going to answer my action my command or

[09:45 - 09:50]
my question because it's going to take

[09:47 - 09:51]
this and use it before it gives me an

[09:50 - 09:55]
answer so after you have a nice role

[09:51 - 09:58]
written down a next good step to take is

[09:55 - 10:00]
actually writing your goal within the

[09:58 - 10:02]
prompt bar let's say right now I'm just

[10:00 - 10:04]
trying to get a plan for how I can

[10:02 - 10:07]
accomplish this in 90 days with

[10:04 - 10:09]
milestones objectives YouTube videos I

[10:07 - 10:10]
might need to post and so on well what I

[10:09 - 10:14]
could do in order to find that is to go

[10:10 - 10:16]
to the specific element within my smart

[10:14 - 10:18]
goals uh resource that I gave you so

[10:16 - 10:21]
really the answer to that question is

[10:18 - 10:23]
under what exactly do I want to achieve

[10:21 - 10:25]
i want 601 new members to join the AI

[10:23 - 10:28]
foundations community in the next 90

[10:25 - 10:30]
days i could just copy that and paste it

[10:28 - 10:33]
right in here so now we have a role and

[10:30 - 10:35]
a goal this is how you think and reframe

[10:33 - 10:36]
your mind about prompt engineering

[10:35 - 10:38]
you're being hyper specific about the

[10:36 - 10:40]
things that you want and how chat GPT

[10:38 - 10:44]
should act so that was kind of like a

[10:40 - 10:48]
step 1.5 if you would uh prompting in a

[10:44 - 10:50]
role but next we need to do the context

[10:48 - 10:53]
provision now context provision probably

[10:50 - 10:55]
one of the most important steps of all

[10:53 - 10:56]
of these in here i would say goal is

[10:55 - 10:58]
definitely the most important but

[10:56 - 11:01]
outside of defining your goal outside of

[10:58 - 11:04]
using AI uh context is going to be the

[11:01 - 11:06]
next biggest thing that you need to add

[11:04 - 11:09]
to your prompt if you want action-driven

[11:06 - 11:11]
results from AI now context in my

[11:09 - 11:14]
opinion is so important that I made an

[11:11 - 11:17]
entire uh module on it same with stating

[11:14 - 11:19]
your goals in our community here so I

[11:17 - 11:22]
put down here I think I said it quite

[11:19 - 11:24]
well when you hear the word context

[11:22 - 11:26]
think statistics and resources when

[11:24 - 11:27]
prompting in a large language model to

[11:26 - 11:29]
solve your problems you need to think

[11:27 - 11:31]
and provide the current way that things

[11:29 - 11:33]
are going the current way things are

[11:31 - 11:35]
looking the duration it's taken the

[11:33 - 11:37]
duration you want to complete things in

[11:35 - 11:39]
percentages results you've seen so far

[11:37 - 11:41]
and more this is going to give the large

[11:39 - 11:44]
language model you're using an idea of

[11:41 - 11:46]
where to start and where it needs to be

[11:44 - 11:48]
when combining this with goals and the

[11:46 - 11:50]
other techniques yet to come you get

[11:48 - 11:51]
something very tailored to you and quite

[11:50 - 11:53]
amazing i couldn't have said it better

[11:51 - 11:55]
there this is the way that you want to

[11:53 - 11:58]
think of context within your prompt so

[11:55 - 12:02]
now we have a role how we want chat GBT

[11:58 - 12:05]
to act right we have a goal based on the

[12:02 - 12:06]
role or I guess the role is based on the

[12:05 - 12:09]
goal either way you get the point we've

[12:06 - 12:10]
got our goal and we've got our role now

[12:09 - 12:12]
we need to give context to chat GBT

[12:10 - 12:14]
about our situation if we want an

[12:12 - 12:16]
effective plan created for us in order

[12:14 - 12:19]
to achieve this so if we're trying to

[12:16 - 12:21]
get this plan what might chat GBPT need

[12:19 - 12:24]
to know in order to understand the

[12:21 - 12:27]
entirety of the situation how fast have

[12:24 - 12:30]
we grown so far what resources do I have

[12:27 - 12:32]
in order to drive growth things like

[12:30 - 12:34]
that and it's cool because you can use

[12:32 - 12:36]
text as context like you can type in all

[12:34 - 12:39]
of these things or you can even select

[12:36 - 12:40]
this and upload an image for context if

[12:39 - 12:44]
you were doing something like website

[12:40 - 12:46]
design you might want to restyle your

[12:44 - 12:48]
homepage different let's say you could

[12:46 - 12:50]
upload that picture as your context as

[12:48 - 12:52]
your current homepage the way that

[12:50 - 12:54]
things currently are and then you could

[12:52 - 12:56]
upload maybe an example of how you want

[12:54 - 12:58]
it to look based on another website and

[12:56 - 13:00]
that would be context into how you want

[12:58 - 13:02]
it to look right providing all sorts of

[13:00 - 13:04]
context is going to be crucial and I

[13:02 - 13:06]
like providing it after the role and the

[13:04 - 13:08]
goal quite high up in the prompt and

[13:06 - 13:09]
then we're later going to get into

[13:08 - 13:11]
things like a sendoff command and an

[13:09 - 13:14]
output format but first let's add some

[13:11 - 13:16]
relevant context to this prompt so if I

[13:14 - 13:18]
go to the school metrics tab as you can

[13:16 - 13:20]
see this is great context right here i

[13:18 - 13:23]
could copy and paste this in and just

[13:20 - 13:25]
reword it a little bit so I'm giving how

[13:23 - 13:26]
much my group has grown in the past 30

[13:25 - 13:29]
days i could even add more metrics in

[13:26 - 13:31]
here if I wanted to but let me go back

[13:29 - 13:32]
to chat GBT and just paste that in and

[13:31 - 13:38]
then I can reword it a little bit so in

[13:32 - 13:44]
the past 30 days I can say my group has

[13:38 - 13:46]
grown to 1434 members plus 203 and 142

[13:44 - 13:48]
members were active i can get rid of

[13:46 - 13:52]
that part right now um just so it knows

[13:48 - 13:53]
my member growth in the past 30 days and

[13:52 - 13:55]
now you need to really think outside of

[13:53 - 13:58]
the box like what other useful

[13:55 - 14:00]
information could chat GBT use in order

[13:58 - 14:04]
to help me here when developing a plan

[14:00 - 14:06]
and an action step-bystep guide in order

[14:04 - 14:09]
to keep this growth up in order to

[14:06 - 14:12]
achieve 601 new members and maybe I can

[14:09 - 14:14]
give a CSV that I got straight from my

[14:12 - 14:17]
YouTube about the views that I've gotten

[14:14 - 14:19]
on each day so it can get insight into

[14:17 - 14:21]
how many views are driving that member

[14:19 - 14:23]
growth and how many views I need to hit

[14:21 - 14:25]
in the next 90 days in order to achieve

[14:23 - 14:27]
similar member growth that's the thing

[14:25 - 14:30]
you have to remember with context is you

[14:27 - 14:32]
can use analytics and files and photos

[14:30 - 14:34]
as well as text so I say I have a

[14:32 - 14:36]
YouTube channel with 250,000 subscribers

[14:34 - 14:40]
where I get my main source of traffic

[14:36 - 14:46]
from i've uploaded the

[14:40 - 14:48]
totals of views per day from the last 28

[14:46 - 14:50]
days and then I can upload that file

[14:48 - 14:54]
that I just showed you i can upload the

[14:50 - 14:56]
entire zip file that contains the videos

[14:54 - 14:58]
the views what's driven the most traffic

[14:56 - 15:00]
etc so that's huge for context when

[14:58 - 15:04]
you're filling out prompts like this and

[15:00 - 15:07]
AI has access to back-end analytics from

[15:04 - 15:09]
what's driven the most growth it's

[15:07 - 15:12]
insane remember what I said in my module

[15:09 - 15:13]
we're talking in the classroom here if I

[15:12 - 15:15]
go back to the large language model

[15:13 - 15:17]
course and providing context we're

[15:15 - 15:19]
thinking statistics and resources what

[15:17 - 15:21]
do I have where am I at where do I want

[15:19 - 15:23]
to be and then when we're giving that

[15:21 - 15:25]
information to chat GPT it's actually

[15:23 - 15:27]
diving much further into our problem and

[15:25 - 15:29]
giving us much more tailored help and

[15:27 - 15:33]
one thing I recommend adding in here for

[15:29 - 15:37]
context is your overall northstar goal

[15:33 - 15:39]
now I want your uh short-term goal or

[15:37 - 15:41]
your short-term project to be near the

[15:39 - 15:43]
top but you can add in your main goal

[15:41 - 15:46]
your northstar total goal in the context

[15:43 - 15:48]
as well just so chat GBT has insight or

[15:46 - 15:50]
your large language model rather has

[15:48 - 15:52]
insight into the overall project that

[15:50 - 15:54]
you're trying to complete so it can gear

[15:52 - 15:56]
the next 90 days closer to that and for

[15:54 - 15:58]
now this is a pretty good prompt i could

[15:56 - 16:00]
keep on going and keep on diving into

[15:58 - 16:03]
context but I want to move on and get

[16:00 - 16:06]
you starting to think about your actions

[16:03 - 16:09]
so actions are important because actions

[16:06 - 16:12]
are literally your sendoff command your

[16:09 - 16:14]
prompt your question everything so it

[16:12 - 16:16]
all comes down to the action and there's

[16:14 - 16:19]
different methodologies for providing

[16:16 - 16:21]
actions in your prompt i recommend

[16:19 - 16:23]
thinking and sticking to one action at a

[16:21 - 16:26]
time so don't try to create a content

[16:23 - 16:28]
calendar an objective milestone plan and

[16:26 - 16:30]
literally everything with one sendoff

[16:28 - 16:32]
because chat GBT only has so much

[16:30 - 16:34]
context that it can also take in and

[16:32 - 16:37]
provide you back so if you're giving it

[16:34 - 16:38]
30 different tasks it can only focus so

[16:37 - 16:40]
far in each direction you want to focus

[16:38 - 16:43]
on one thing and have it do that one

[16:40 - 16:44]
thing very very good and if you do focus

[16:43 - 16:46]
on one thing it's going to put all of

[16:44 - 16:48]
its token limit all of its energy and

[16:46 - 16:50]
all of its thought into that single

[16:48 - 16:52]
thing and we're nearing the top of the

[16:50 - 16:55]
pyramid here actions super important one

[16:52 - 16:57]
of my favorite parts other than output

[16:55 - 16:58]
formatting of course so if we wanted to

[16:57 - 17:01]
break this up I could do that real quick

[16:58 - 17:03]
we have our role we have our goal and

[17:01 - 17:06]
then we have all of our context down

[17:03 - 17:08]
here as you can see context is taking up

[17:06 - 17:10]
most of this space we even have context

[17:08 - 17:13]
up here in the form of a zip file so now

[17:10 - 17:14]
let's get into our action and output

[17:13 - 17:17]
format first we need the action so what

[17:14 - 17:18]
do we want chat GBT to do for us this is

[17:17 - 17:20]
where it gets fun and this is where you

[17:18 - 17:22]
really have to get creative and start

[17:20 - 17:24]
thinking about the direction you want

[17:22 - 17:26]
this to go cuz it could go any direction

[17:24 - 17:27]
I want i could I could tell it to do

[17:26 - 17:29]
anything with this information it has

[17:27 - 17:30]
here i could tell it to create me a

[17:29 - 17:32]
content calendar for the next 10 days i

[17:30 - 17:34]
could tell it to create me milestone

[17:32 - 17:36]
objectives which that's kind of the

[17:34 - 17:38]
route that I'm thinking about going you

[17:36 - 17:40]
can do so many things here but I'm going

[17:38 - 17:42]
to say this create me a trackable

[17:40 - 17:44]
strategy guide that I can check off

[17:42 - 17:47]
weekly with objectives and milestones

[17:44 - 17:49]
for member growth and content created so

[17:47 - 17:52]
this would be an example of giving a

[17:49 - 17:54]
very specific action now actions very

[17:52 - 17:56]
important because like I said it changes

[17:54 - 17:57]
the entire direction of the prompt what

[17:56 - 18:00]
if I would have said create me a content

[17:57 - 18:01]
calendar that is in line with all of

[18:00 - 18:03]
this well then it would have created me

[18:01 - 18:05]
a content calendar here I'm giving a

[18:03 - 18:08]
command you know you could ask questions

[18:05 - 18:10]
as well so you could ask like based on

[18:08 - 18:12]
my growth what is the best route you

[18:10 - 18:14]
think I should go in regards to content

[18:12 - 18:16]
I need to be creating because remember

[18:14 - 18:17]
it has access to all of my videos I've

[18:16 - 18:19]
created in the past 30 days and what's

[18:17 - 18:21]
been doing the best so the more context

[18:19 - 18:23]
you give the more powerful of results AI

[18:21 - 18:25]
can give you now that doesn't mean just

[18:23 - 18:27]
overload your prompt with a bunch of

[18:25 - 18:29]
context this is a pretty good uh set of

[18:27 - 18:31]
context here i'm not giving it too much

[18:29 - 18:33]
information but I'm giving it very

[18:31 - 18:36]
important details that actually matter

[18:33 - 18:38]
and actually giving it statistics of how

[18:36 - 18:40]
I've performed in the past 30 days so

[18:38 - 18:41]
now I have my action right the I want

[18:40 - 18:44]
the trackable strategy guide that I can

[18:41 - 18:46]
check off weekly now it's time to get

[18:44 - 18:49]
into the fun part the output formatting

[18:46 - 18:51]
the top of this little hierarchy here

[18:49 - 18:53]
very very cool so what kind of output do

[18:51 - 18:55]
you want this in there's multiple

[18:53 - 18:56]
different routes you could go this is I

[18:55 - 18:58]
think tip number five by the way out of

[18:56 - 19:00]
seven is output formatting and output

[18:58 - 19:02]
formatting is huge because you can get

[19:00 - 19:04]
this in a CSV format you could get this

[19:02 - 19:07]
with tables being generated bullet list

[19:04 - 19:10]
numbered list uh PDFs that are

[19:07 - 19:12]
downloadable SVG i mean you could do

[19:10 - 19:15]
pretty much whatever you want for your

[19:12 - 19:18]
output format and um you could even do

[19:15 - 19:20]
charts you know visualizations images so

[19:18 - 19:22]
output format's pretty fun and that's

[19:20 - 19:23]
something you can do as you go as well

[19:22 - 19:26]
that's not something you really have to

[19:23 - 19:30]
send off right now but for now I can say

[19:26 - 19:33]
output format this

[19:30 - 19:35]
response or instead of response I could

[19:33 - 19:37]
say this strategy guide remember be

[19:35 - 19:39]
specific about what you want i mentioned

[19:37 - 19:41]
it i told it to create a strategy guide

[19:39 - 19:43]
up here so if I want the strategy guide

[19:41 - 19:44]
in a certain format make sure that I

[19:43 - 19:47]
mention okay this is what I want the

[19:44 - 19:51]
strategy guide in so I'm saying output

[19:47 - 19:53]
format the strategy guide with tips

[19:51 - 19:56]
paragraphs for

[19:53 - 20:00]
direction and

[19:56 - 20:02]
checkboxes I can check off beautiful so

[20:00 - 20:04]
I'm giving a bunch of different things

[20:02 - 20:06]
that I want the output format to include

[20:04 - 20:08]
and now comes the fun part we've been

[20:06 - 20:10]
crafting this beautiful prompt and we've

[20:08 - 20:13]
been creating this exactly how we want

[20:10 - 20:15]
it so now let's send it off and when I

[20:13 - 20:17]
hit send as you're going to see

[20:15 - 20:19]
chatgbt40 is going to get to work it's

[20:17 - 20:21]
going to get analyzing here which is

[20:19 - 20:24]
beautiful right now it's extracting my

[20:21 - 20:26]
file content and yeah I'm excited to see

[20:24 - 20:29]
what answer we get when you give good

[20:26 - 20:30]
context you give a good goal you

[20:29 - 20:32]
actually think about how you're thinking

[20:30 - 20:34]
you think about the way you're asking

[20:32 - 20:36]
questions think about the output format

[20:34 - 20:38]
when you take all of this this little

[20:36 - 20:40]
prompt engineering hierarchy here and

[20:38 - 20:42]
you combine it into one thing you get

[20:40 - 20:43]
amazing results so without asking they

[20:42 - 20:45]
even gave me a chart which I can make

[20:43 - 20:48]
interactive and I can check my YouTube

[20:45 - 20:49]
stats over the past 28 days as you can

[20:48 - 20:51]
see I'm plummeting so make sure you drop

[20:49 - 20:53]
a like and tell your friends to watch

[20:51 - 20:55]
this video to get me back up to these

[20:53 - 20:58]
levels no I'm joking but let's dive into

[20:55 - 21:01]
what it created for me so first to

[20:58 - 21:03]
analyze that uh thing I gave it that uh

[21:01 - 21:05]
file with all of my views and it said

[21:03 - 21:07]
"Thanks i see your view trends over the

[21:05 - 21:09]
last month averaging around 10 to 13,000

[21:07 - 21:11]
views per day with some variation." It

[21:09 - 21:14]
says based on this your ambitious target

[21:11 - 21:16]
6001 new members in 90 days let's build

[21:14 - 21:18]
a trackable weekly strategy guide and it

[21:16 - 21:21]
says it's going to focus on these three

[21:18 - 21:23]
things so then down here gives the AI

[21:21 - 21:26]
Foundation's 90-day growth strategy

[21:23 - 21:28]
guide gives my goal my time frame my

[21:26 - 21:30]
north star and it's all packaged in such

[21:28 - 21:32]
a nice way compared to if you were just

[21:30 - 21:33]
to go in here and randomly start typing

[21:32 - 21:35]
out things with no direction or no

[21:33 - 21:38]
structure it gives me my key weekly

[21:35 - 21:39]
objectives says each week check off the

[21:38 - 21:42]
following and so it's giving me a weekly

[21:39 - 21:43]
strategy that every Monday I can come in

[21:42 - 21:45]
here review and it actually provided

[21:43 - 21:47]
checkboxes for me because I specified

[21:45 - 21:50]
that in the output format and it gives

[21:47 - 21:52]
me a literal weekby- week road map of 13

[21:50 - 21:54]
weeks for everything I need to do each

[21:52 - 21:56]
week and milestone member objectives

[21:54 - 21:58]
that I need to be hitting gives me the

[21:56 - 22:00]
conversion test retention loop invite

[21:58 - 22:02]
strategy it's giving me new things to

[22:00 - 22:05]
implement each week with checkboxes that

[22:02 - 22:07]
I can check off and that weekly strategy

[22:05 - 22:10]
review every single Monday that I can uh

[22:07 - 22:12]
do in order to increase my member growth

[22:10 - 22:13]
so it gives me all of that and I could

[22:12 - 22:15]
go in here and review this i could

[22:13 - 22:17]
change things as I wish um I like how it

[22:15 - 22:19]
added that little party emoji there at

[22:17 - 22:21]
the end a nice little fun celebration

[22:19 - 22:23]
but it also gives me bonus metric

[22:21 - 22:25]
tracker which I think is sweet gives me

[22:23 - 22:27]
the metrics that I need to track and the

[22:25 - 22:30]
weekly target that I need to hit so it's

[22:27 - 22:32]
wanting me to hit $10,000 I mean excuse

[22:30 - 22:37]
me 10,000 views a day with a 28 day

[22:32 - 22:39]
average and um a CTA of 1.5 to 3%

[22:37 - 22:41]
conversion rate 1% minimum so it's

[22:39 - 22:43]
literally giving me all the stats I need

[22:41 - 22:45]
the views I need to hit in order to

[22:43 - 22:48]
achieve this goal and the only reason it

[22:45 - 22:50]
knows anything about this is because I

[22:48 - 22:52]
gave it all that context into where I

[22:50 - 22:54]
was currently at where I wanted to be

[22:52 - 22:56]
and a time frame to complete it in it

[22:54 - 22:58]
all started with defining my goals using

[22:56 - 22:59]
smart goals so all of this is beautiful

[22:58 - 23:00]
now I have two more prompt engineering

[22:59 - 23:02]
tips that I want to give you in order to

[23:00 - 23:04]
help you move forward i'm going to make

[23:02 - 23:06]
these quick that way you can move on and

[23:04 - 23:10]
get prompting within your language

[23:06 - 23:12]
models but tip number six in the entire

[23:10 - 23:14]
prompt engineering video would be to

[23:12 - 23:16]
templatize your prompts that have been

[23:14 - 23:18]
successful let's say that you are

[23:16 - 23:20]
somebody who now wants to help other

[23:18 - 23:23]
people grow their school communities

[23:20 - 23:25]
well maybe you have a funnel right where

[23:23 - 23:27]
or a classroom or a course or a

[23:25 - 23:30]
community or consulting group where you

[23:27 - 23:32]
teach people how to use YouTube in order

[23:30 - 23:34]
to grow school communities maybe that's

[23:32 - 23:36]
your business maybe you used this prompt

[23:34 - 23:37]
for yourself and it worked well now I

[23:36 - 23:39]
want you to do something that's called

[23:37 - 23:41]
templatizing your prompt i want you to

[23:39 - 23:43]
copy it i want you to open up a new

[23:41 - 23:45]
Google Docs or Microsoft Word and if

[23:43 - 23:46]
this was a successful prompt for you I

[23:45 - 23:48]
want you to think about how you can make

[23:46 - 23:50]
it a template so that it can work for

[23:48 - 23:51]
you in the future when using it for

[23:50 - 23:54]
other school communities or so that it

[23:51 - 23:56]
can work for other people now this is a

[23:54 - 23:58]
pretty basic concept but maybe I want to

[23:56 - 24:00]
keep some some things the same that I

[23:58 - 24:02]
thought were very helpful to have and

[24:00 - 24:05]
some things different and dynamic for

[24:02 - 24:07]
other people on school who want to grow

[24:05 - 24:09]
their communities so maybe I say create

[24:07 - 24:10]
me a trackable strategy guide and all

[24:09 - 24:13]
that is good maybe I want to keep that

[24:10 - 24:15]
the same um in my prompt template but

[24:13 - 24:18]
there are some things that we need to

[24:15 - 24:21]
change so I want how many new members to

[24:18 - 24:23]
join uh what community in how many days

[24:21 - 24:26]
here's what an example of templatizing

[24:23 - 24:29]
your prompt would look like so I could

[24:26 - 24:33]
say um instead of 601 I could just put

[24:29 - 24:35]
some brackets and say number of new

[24:33 - 24:37]
members and so anybody can come in here

[24:35 - 24:39]
and they can input the number of new

[24:37 - 24:41]
members they want to join and then I

[24:39 - 24:45]
could put

[24:41 - 24:46]
community name so I'm basically just

[24:45 - 24:48]
turning this prompt that worked well for

[24:46 - 24:51]
me into a template for other people to

[24:48 - 24:55]
use in the next and then I could put

[24:51 - 24:56]
right here time frame so this is what

[24:55 - 24:59]
you do when you have a successful prompt

[24:56 - 25:01]
is you can templatize it you can even in

[24:59 - 25:03]
Google Docs highlight certain things and

[25:01 - 25:06]
bold certain things that are dynamic and

[25:03 - 25:07]
change from person to person but this is

[25:06 - 25:09]
the way I like to go about creating

[25:07 - 25:11]
prompt templates in order to help myself

[25:09 - 25:13]
out in the future and other people that

[25:11 - 25:15]
are going to be using these uh prompts

[25:13 - 25:16]
as well so as you can see if I wanted to

[25:15 - 25:17]
templatize this prompt this is what that

[25:16 - 25:20]
would look like and this is going to

[25:17 - 25:21]
save you time in the future for personal

[25:20 - 25:23]
prompts or when you're giving away

[25:21 - 25:25]
prompt templates to other people a quick

[25:23 - 25:26]
prompt engineering tip that I just

[25:25 - 25:28]
wanted to share this has been very

[25:26 - 25:30]
helpful for me i've got a ton of prompt

[25:28 - 25:32]
templates saved in Notion and Google

[25:30 - 25:34]
Docs and everywhere else not only for

[25:32 - 25:35]
myself but for other people and it just

[25:34 - 25:38]
saves a ton of time because now people

[25:35 - 25:40]
could just come in here and uh if they

[25:38 - 25:41]
know the process of course which you

[25:40 - 25:43]
might have to teach they could just come

[25:41 - 25:46]
in here and say I want okay how many new

[25:43 - 25:50]
members do I want maybe I want 500 new

[25:46 - 25:52]
members to join um my community whatever

[25:50 - 25:55]
your community name is in the next maybe

[25:52 - 25:57]
it's 180 days and you know you could

[25:55 - 25:58]
even give information like how much does

[25:57 - 26:01]
your group cost how much are you

[25:58 - 26:03]
increasing the price to once 250 members

[26:01 - 26:04]
come in as much context as you want to

[26:03 - 26:06]
give but this would be an example of

[26:04 - 26:08]
templatizing your prompt and I think

[26:06 - 26:09]
it's a very useful prompt engineering

[26:08 - 26:11]
tip for when something works

[26:09 - 26:13]
successfully and you want to repeat that

[26:11 - 26:16]
success now the last tip I want to give

[26:13 - 26:18]
you which this goes very in-depth and

[26:16 - 26:20]
you can actually do some insane things

[26:18 - 26:22]
with this is to create custom

[26:20 - 26:23]
instructions for your chatbot now this

[26:22 - 26:25]
is going to allow you to set

[26:23 - 26:26]
instructions in the back end of pretty

[26:25 - 26:27]
much any application you want to use

[26:26 - 26:30]
nowadays like I think Claude and

[26:27 - 26:33]
Perplexity and ChatGBT and N8N if you're

[26:30 - 26:35]
building agents everything has this but

[26:33 - 26:37]
it's setting a system message or backend

[26:35 - 26:39]
instructions let me show you what that

[26:37 - 26:41]
might look like very quickly so if we're

[26:39 - 26:44]
on this example here I'll send this off

[26:41 - 26:45]
again to show you um what custom

[26:44 - 26:47]
instructions allow you to do but if you

[26:45 - 26:50]
go to the upper right hand corner and go

[26:47 - 26:54]
to customize chat GBT in this case you

[26:50 - 26:56]
can actually uh give chat GBT uh more

[26:54 - 26:58]
personalized responses by using some of

[26:56 - 27:01]
these fields and pretty much any LLM has

[26:58 - 27:03]
this now but in what trait should chat

[27:01 - 27:04]
GBT have uh let me just show you an

[27:03 - 27:07]
example of what providing backend

[27:04 - 27:09]
instructions can do for you maybe I want

[27:07 - 27:13]
ChatGBT to write all of its sentences

[27:09 - 27:15]
backwards uh no matter what right maybe

[27:13 - 27:18]
I want a specified output format every

[27:15 - 27:20]
single time so I don't have to prompt it

[27:18 - 27:23]
within my prompt bar i could hit save

[27:20 - 27:26]
and then maybe I just want to take this

[27:23 - 27:29]
and go back start a new chat paste it in

[27:26 - 27:32]
and I can um get rid of the zip archive

[27:29 - 27:33]
since I don't have that uploaded and

[27:32 - 27:35]
then I could send this off and what

[27:33 - 27:37]
you're going to notice is chat GPT will

[27:35 - 27:40]
now write every single one of its

[27:37 - 27:42]
sentences backwards so obviously this is

[27:40 - 27:44]
just a goofy example and you could get a

[27:42 - 27:46]
lot more in-depth with this but I just

[27:44 - 27:49]
wanted to show you uh how that works

[27:46 - 27:51]
within the custom instructions so now as

[27:49 - 27:54]
you can see Chad GBT looks like it's

[27:51 - 27:55]
talking in code and um it's writing all

[27:54 - 27:57]
of its sentences backwards because I

[27:55 - 28:00]
instructed it to do so in the back end

[27:57 - 28:03]
so very foundational concept uh of

[28:00 - 28:05]
providing instructions actually go super

[28:03 - 28:07]
in-depth in this in the premium AI

[28:05 - 28:09]
foundation school community of course

[28:07 - 28:10]
but providing instructions is one of

[28:09 - 28:13]
those things that's going to save you so

[28:10 - 28:16]
much time and puts chat GBT in the shoes

[28:13 - 28:18]
of whatever you want it to be 247 so

[28:16 - 28:20]
these have been seven prompt engineering

[28:18 - 28:23]
tips that will help you get up to speed

[28:20 - 28:26]
and use AI how it's meant to be used now

[28:23 - 28:27]
if you learn these truly you will become

[28:26 - 28:29]
smarter you can increase your net worth

[28:27 - 28:32]
you can increase your intellect and if

[28:29 - 28:34]
you're just using AI in general now if

[28:32 - 28:36]
you're not using AI right now I highly

[28:34 - 28:38]
highly recommend it even if you're not

[28:36 - 28:40]
going to use all the fancy techniques I

[28:38 - 28:43]
showed you in today's video just get

[28:40 - 28:46]
asking questions to it and start diving

[28:43 - 28:47]
into what what do you have in your mind

[28:46 - 28:49]
what do you want to create what do you

[28:47 - 28:51]
want to know the answers to what do you

[28:49 - 28:52]
want to brainstorm there are so many

[28:51 - 28:54]
different routes you could take with AI

[28:52 - 28:56]
and that's what makes it so exciting now

[28:54 - 28:58]
if you want to join a network of people

[28:56 - 29:01]
who are using this daily and who are

[28:58 - 29:03]
succeeding landing jobs getting clients

[29:01 - 29:04]
learning how to build automations

[29:03 - 29:06]
learning the basics of prompt

[29:04 - 29:08]
engineering and advanced concepts of

[29:06 - 29:10]
prompt engineering then again I

[29:08 - 29:12]
recommend joining my AI foundations

[29:10 - 29:14]
community which I run with my brother

[29:12 - 29:17]
and partner Carter otherwise known as

[29:14 - 29:18]
productive dude on YouTube here like I

[29:17 - 29:20]
said we've got the classroom where you

[29:18 - 29:22]
can learn about large language models in

[29:20 - 29:24]
depth this is this video right here is

[29:22 - 29:27]
just scratching the surface you learn

[29:24 - 29:30]
about AI image generation AI audio

[29:27 - 29:33]
generation AI video generation and also

[29:30 - 29:36]
building out full stack agents to work

[29:33 - 29:38]
for you while you sleep so I recommend

[29:36 - 29:41]
joining this probably the best spot to

[29:38 - 29:43]
be in the AI industry right now a lot of

[29:41 - 29:44]
scams out there a lot of people looking

[29:43 - 29:46]
for money we're more so looking for

[29:44 - 29:48]
connection and that's why we want you

[29:46 - 29:50]
there so when you get in there introduce

[29:48 - 29:52]
yourself and make yourself at home all

[29:50 - 29:54]
right with that being said I hope you

[29:52 - 29:57]
enjoyed these tips and I will see you in

[29:54 - 29:57]

Great video! The seven-step prompt engineering guide is clear and practical, especially the focus on defining SMART goals, specifying roles, and providing detailed context. The technical explanations about structuring prompts, using context (like analytics and files), and formatting outputs are spot-on for anyone wanting to get the most out of AI tools. If you add a quick summary or checklist at the end, it would make the learning process even smoother. Thanks for sharing such actionable and technically sound advice!

### 8. @MarkJohnson-of2sv (👍 13)
Love these videos that show how to actually prompt effectively (and the work involved) rather than the “here’s the amazing prompt that makes $10k apps”

> **@ai-foundations** (👍 4): Glad you enjoyed it Mark!! I like to get into the brass tacks 😁

> **@ricksiddiqui8354** (👍 3): ​@@ai-foundations I'm today years old in learning that it's "brass tacks" and not "brass tax" 😂😂😂

As always, you guys are noted gurus of AI and your content is beyond awesome and helpful.

### 9. @dylan.siegel (👍 5)
This video provides a solid foundation in prompt engineering! The breakdown into seven practical steps is particularly useful for anyone looking to get better results from AI models.

Key takeaways for effective prompting, based on the video:

Define Your Goal (SMART): Be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound with your requests. This clarity is essential.

Assign an AI Role: Tell the AI who it should be (e.g., expert copywriter, data analyst) to frame its responses.

Provide Context: Don't assume the AI knows your situation. Give it background info, data, or resources.

Clear Actions: State exactly what you want the AI to do (e.g., summarize, analyze, write, list).

Specify Output Format: Request the structure you need (e.g., bullet points, table, JSON) for easier use.

Templatize: Save your successful prompts! This saves time and ensures consistency for recurring tasks.

Use Custom Instructions: Tailor the AI's default behavior for responses that better fit your ongoing needs.

Mastering these steps really seems like the key to unlocking more powerful AI interactions. The emphasis on treating prompting as a skill is spot on.

### 10. @des7638 (👍 2)
Consistently one of the best AI teachers

### 11. @LynneMadison0731 (👍 1)
Wow! This was very straight forward and easy to understand for a A.I noob like myself. You worded it best describing it as a "Digital Brain". 🧠  I would love a career teaching A.I or writing A.I prompts. I like to write and was wanting to be an addiction counselor for the longest time. I feel like A.I would be so beneficial to the medical field, whether it be physical or mental health. I think people like Fei Fei Li are interesting to gather information about. I am definitely interested in your classes as well.

You da man. Thanks for these tips, excellento. Thanks again!

### 16. @augmentos (👍 3)
You didn't mention that best practices on some models is actually really not meta prompting or over prompting them, and allowing them to work on their own, so to an extent it is being phased out though a well formed, though not overly verbose initial prompt is still worthwhile. Would be nice to see a video on this.

> **@TimsMySuedNoTim** (👍 0): I’m not sure this is true. Ai isn’t thinking it’s mathematics, and the prompts help connect the algorithm to your own personal needs, which helps match the output to your personal needs. You will always be needed to provide insight to you.

> **@augmentos** (👍 0): @ on A prompt yes of course, but the latest frontier models don’t require much of what was ‘prompt engineering’ like setting a role, over defining tasks etc things that were ‘best practices’ in prompting 3-6 months ago. In fact try to neutrally ASK the latest models about this
