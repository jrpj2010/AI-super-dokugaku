[00:00 - 00:04]
JT GBT has changed the game when it

[00:02 - 00:06]
comes to generating images, but most

[00:04 - 00:09]
people are not using it to its fullest

[00:06 - 00:10]
potential. Now you can replace a design

[00:09 - 00:13]
team worth tens of thousands of dollars

[00:10 - 00:16]
a month with ChateBT if you know how to

[00:13 - 00:18]
use it right. Not to mention, you can

[00:16 - 00:19]
now avoid additional software

[00:18 - 00:21]
subscriptions, all those $20 a month

[00:19 - 00:22]
subscriptions as well. That's why in

[00:21 - 00:25]
this video, I'm going to share with you

[00:22 - 00:27]
how to craft prompts in the Chat GPT40

[00:25 - 00:30]
image model that gets you the kind of

[00:27 - 00:32]
images that you want. examples of

[00:30 - 00:34]
different image use cases and one of the

[00:32 - 00:37]
fastest ways of generating multiple

[00:34 - 00:40]
variations of an image which you cannot

[00:37 - 00:42]
do inside of ChachiPT itself that will

[00:40 - 00:44]
make your workflows so much faster. If

[00:42 - 00:46]
you're new here, my name is Rick Mul

[00:44 - 00:48]
already and for the past 11 and a half

[00:46 - 00:50]
years, I've run a multisefigure online

[00:48 - 00:52]
business helping other online business

[00:50 - 00:54]
owners grow and scale their business.

[00:52 - 00:56]
Today, I run a community called the AI

[00:54 - 00:59]
playbook where I help online businesses

[00:56 - 01:01]
leverage AI so that you can streamline

[00:59 - 01:03]
your business and increase profitability

[01:01 - 01:04]
in the process. I'll link to the

[01:03 - 01:06]
community in the description below. Now

[01:04 - 01:08]
for tip number one, when it comes to

[01:06 - 01:10]
reliably generating the kind of images

[01:08 - 01:13]
that you want in Chat GBT, not

[01:10 - 01:16]
surprisingly, it comes down to clear

[01:13 - 01:18]
specific instructions in your prompt.

[01:16 - 01:22]
And I like to include eight different

[01:18 - 01:24]
elements whenever I'm prompting chatbt

[01:22 - 01:25]
to create an image. Now actually I

[01:24 - 01:28]
shouldn't say that I don't I don't

[01:25 - 01:31]
always include eight elements but if I

[01:28 - 01:34]
know that I want to get very specific

[01:31 - 01:36]
consistent results I will include these

[01:34 - 01:38]
elements. So the first element is going

[01:36 - 01:41]
to be your subject. What do you want the

[01:38 - 01:43]
image to be of? So describe the main

[01:41 - 01:45]
subject super clearly. What kind of

[01:43 - 01:48]
appearance are they wearing? Clothes if

[01:45 - 01:52]
it's a person. Uh what's the pose, the

[01:48 - 01:54]
expression? Is it a castle? Is it an F1

[01:52 - 01:56]
race car? Whatever it might be. This is

[01:54 - 01:58]
going to be the subject of your image.

[01:56 - 02:00]
The next thing being the composition.

[01:58 - 02:03]
This is where you want to specify like a

[02:00 - 02:05]
camera angle, framing, arrangement of

[02:03 - 02:08]
the elements, uh that sort of thing. The

[02:05 - 02:10]
next one's the style. Do you want the uh

[02:08 - 02:14]
image to be any specific kind of style

[02:10 - 02:16]
like realistic cartoon, cyberpunk, etc.?

[02:14 - 02:17]
Then if you want lighting to be

[02:16 - 02:20]
included, specific kind of lighting to

[02:17 - 02:21]
be included in the image, this is where

[02:20 - 02:23]
you want to include that like soft

[02:21 - 02:26]
morning light or sunset or something

[02:23 - 02:28]
like that. The color, this is where if

[02:26 - 02:30]
you have brand colors, so if you have

[02:28 - 02:31]
like hex codes of your brand colors

[02:30 - 02:35]
you're going to want to make sure that

[02:31 - 02:38]
you include those hex colors in your

[02:35 - 02:40]
prompt. The next thing is the mood. Do

[02:38 - 02:43]
you want it to be like emotional or

[02:40 - 02:44]
energetic, mysterious, that sort of

[02:43 - 02:46]
thing. The seventh element is going to

[02:44 - 02:48]
be any kind of details that you want

[02:46 - 02:50]
included in the images. This is where

[02:48 - 02:52]
you want to highlight unique features or

[02:50 - 02:53]
elements that you want to included or to

[02:52 - 02:56]
avoid, which I'll tell you more about

[02:53 - 02:58]
that in just a second. So like props

[02:56 - 03:00]
accessories, a coffee cup, uh something

[02:58 - 03:02]
like that, facial marks, whatever. And

[03:00 - 03:04]
then the final thing, super important

[03:02 - 03:06]
you want to give it the context. So

[03:04 - 03:10]
describe the setting, describe the time

[03:06 - 03:13]
period. Is are you creating a a YouTube

[03:10 - 03:14]
video thumbnail, describe the context of

[03:13 - 03:16]
why you want the image created? Now

[03:14 - 03:18]
within the structure of these eight

[03:16 - 03:20]
elements, like I just mentioned, a good

[03:18 - 03:24]
practice is to use negative prompting.

[03:20 - 03:26]
So, for example, don't include or no

[03:24 - 03:28]
use the word no. So, if you're drawing a

[03:26 - 03:31]
picnic scene, for example, you can put

[03:28 - 03:34]
in like no people, no birds, uh no

[03:31 - 03:36]
blanket or whatever it might be. So be

[03:34 - 03:38]
really really clear on what it is that

[03:36 - 03:40]
you want in the image as well as what

[03:38 - 03:42]
you don't want in the image. And here's

[03:40 - 03:44]
where it gets really interesting. Once

[03:42 - 03:48]
you understand this framework, you can

[03:44 - 03:50]
totally systematize your entire visual

[03:48 - 03:52]
brand because you just keep including

[03:50 - 03:54]
these elements within all the prompts

[03:52 - 03:57]
where you want to create images and then

[03:54 - 03:59]
you just start saving these prompts.

[03:57 - 04:01]
Even better, and I talked about it in a

[03:59 - 04:04]
recent video here on the channel, a pro

[04:01 - 04:06]
tip would be to use ChachiBT's extended

[04:04 - 04:09]
memory to your advantage. So, for

[04:06 - 04:11]
example, you could say uh you could give

[04:09 - 04:13]
ChachBT your hex codes for your brand

[04:11 - 04:16]
colors and you could tell Chachbt to

[04:13 - 04:18]
remember your hex codes as your brand

[04:16 - 04:20]
colors. So, the next time you want to

[04:18 - 04:22]
create an image, you could say using my

[04:20 - 04:24]
brand colors. It's all you'd have to do.

[04:22 - 04:27]
You don't have to retype in the hex

[04:24 - 04:30]
codes. Or if you have a hero image that

[04:27 - 04:32]
you like to include in your brand

[04:30 - 04:35]
elements for example or creating images

[04:32 - 04:37]
you could tell chatbt to remember that

[04:35 - 04:39]
as your hero image and then you can just

[04:37 - 04:40]
reference that whenever you want to

[04:39 - 04:41]
create a new image. All right, the next

[04:40 - 04:42]
thing I want to show you now that we

[04:41 - 04:45]
have our prompting techniques for

[04:42 - 04:47]
creating consistently reliable images

[04:45 - 04:49]
with ChachiBT, let's create a brand

[04:47 - 04:51]
board because a brand board can drive

[04:49 - 04:53]
the future look and feel of all your

[04:51 - 04:55]
brand images. So this is the prompt that

[04:53 - 04:57]
I like to use and it simply includes

[04:55 - 04:58]
each of the eight elements that we just

[04:57 - 05:00]
talked about. So again, it's got your

[04:58 - 05:03]
subject composition style etc. and

[05:00 - 05:06]
the input variables for each one of

[05:03 - 05:07]
these sections of your prompt. Okay, so

[05:06 - 05:09]
now let's actually create a brand board

[05:07 - 05:11]
from that prompt. And I'm going to put

[05:09 - 05:13]
the variables from my own brand as input

[05:11 - 05:15]
variables into that prompt, which is

[05:13 - 05:18]
this prompt right here. I'm going to

[05:15 - 05:19]
click on go, and we'll see what comes

[05:18 - 05:20]
up. All right, here's the finished brand

[05:19 - 05:22]
board that it just created for me based

[05:20 - 05:23]
on the prompt I just gave it. It's

[05:22 - 05:26]
actually pretty good. I mean, it's got

[05:23 - 05:27]
the colors, the fonts, examples of

[05:26 - 05:29]
images that we could use. I could

[05:27 - 05:31]
totally download this and I could then

[05:29 - 05:34]
go and upload this into Canva, for

[05:31 - 05:37]
example, and use this as a brand kit in

[05:34 - 05:40]
Canva if I wanted to. Or better yet, I

[05:37 - 05:42]
could actually ask ChattBT to save this

[05:40 - 05:44]
brand board in its memory for me so that

[05:42 - 05:45]
I can just reference it whenever I want

[05:44 - 05:49]
to be creating images. is I could just

[05:45 - 05:50]
say based on my brand board do this and

[05:49 - 05:52]
it'll remember it. Tip number three

[05:50 - 05:55]
this is what I like to call image to

[05:52 - 05:57]
prompt reverse engineering. So this is

[05:55 - 06:00]
where you upload an image and then you

[05:57 - 06:02]
ask chat to describe the prompt that

[06:00 - 06:04]
could recreate that image. This is great

[06:02 - 06:07]
for when you know you're on the internet

[06:04 - 06:09]
and you come across images that you love

[06:07 - 06:10]
the aesthetic, you love the look of the

[06:09 - 06:12]
image and you want to be able to

[06:10 - 06:15]
recreate that type of aesthetic or look

[06:12 - 06:16]
in your own images. use this tip right

[06:15 - 06:18]
here. So, I'm going to paste in an image

[06:16 - 06:20]
here. It's just a screenshot of an image

[06:18 - 06:22]
that I found on Instagram. It's actually

[06:20 - 06:24]
an Instagram ad. And by the way, if you

[06:22 - 06:26]
run ads at all, this is a great way if

[06:24 - 06:29]
you consistently see the same ad over

[06:26 - 06:31]
and over and over, chances are that ad

[06:29 - 06:32]
is doing well and the person or company

[06:31 - 06:35]
is continuing to run that ad because

[06:32 - 06:37]
it's doing well. Well, you can learn a

[06:35 - 06:40]
lot from that. take a screenshot of the

[06:37 - 06:41]
image itself, stick it in the chatbt

[06:40 - 06:45]
here, and you can simply say something

[06:41 - 06:48]
like, "Describe the prompt that could

[06:45 - 06:50]
recreate this image." And with that

[06:48 - 06:52]
simple of a request, describe the prompt

[06:50 - 06:53]
that could recreate this image. I could

[06:52 - 06:55]
be a little bit more specific there, but

[06:53 - 06:57]
I wanted to see what it would do. Here

[06:55 - 07:00]
I have this detailed prompt that

[06:57 - 07:03]
describes that image. So, I can use this

[07:00 - 07:07]
prompt to recreate that image. So, let's

[07:03 - 07:08]
actually use the prompt and see what it

[07:07 - 07:11]
does. All right. And here's the image

[07:08 - 07:13]
that it just recreated using the prompt

[07:11 - 07:15]
that we asked Chat GBT for to describe

[07:13 - 07:18]
that original image. Here's the one that

[07:15 - 07:22]
I just created. Here is the

[07:18 - 07:24]
original. I mean, pretty darn close

[07:22 - 07:26]
right? Um, makes me really hungry right

[07:24 - 07:29]
now. So, this is a great way as you get

[07:26 - 07:31]
inspiration when you're online to prompt

[07:29 - 07:34]
reverse engineer a specific image or

[07:31 - 07:35]
images and have it write the prompt for

[07:34 - 07:37]
you and then you go and customize that

[07:35 - 07:38]
prompt for whatever it is that you want

[07:37 - 07:40]
to do. Now, speaking of capturing things

[07:38 - 07:43]
that I come across online, before I

[07:40 - 07:46]
share the next tip for you, one tool

[07:43 - 07:48]
that I use all the time in my workflows

[07:46 - 07:51]
to capture the inspiration I come across

[07:48 - 07:54]
online or content that I want captured

[07:51 - 07:57]
and and summarized is recall. recall

[07:54 - 08:01]
captures and summarizes anything that I

[07:57 - 08:04]
watch, listen to, read, or open online.

[08:01 - 08:06]
And it saves it in one AI powered

[08:04 - 08:08]
knowledge base. It instantly summarizes

[08:06 - 08:11]
YouTube videos, PDFs, articles

[08:08 - 08:13]
podcasts, and more. I can also chat with

[08:11 - 08:16]
all the content that I'm capturing

[08:13 - 08:18]
inside of Recall as it saves it and

[08:16 - 08:20]
organizes it in its own smart AI

[08:18 - 08:22]
library. I don't have to lift a finger.

[08:20 - 08:24]
It does it automatically for me. And a

[08:22 - 08:27]
surprisingly cool feature has been the

[08:24 - 08:29]
quiz feature. So when I'm on my phone

[08:27 - 08:31]
and I have a few minutes to spare, I

[08:29 - 08:33]
just run through my personalized

[08:31 - 08:35]
learning schedule that I've created

[08:33 - 08:37]
within Recall so that I can actually

[08:35 - 08:38]
take in and learn from the content that

[08:37 - 08:40]
I'm capturing. So if you want to check

[08:38 - 08:42]
out recall, I put a link in the

[08:40 - 08:44]
description below. Use the promo code

[08:42 - 08:46]
recall Rick and you'll get 25% off

[08:44 - 08:47]
Recall. So for image tip number three

[08:46 - 08:50]
we're going to use what we've learned so

[08:47 - 08:52]
far, especially the memory feature of

[08:50 - 08:54]
ChatBT, and we're going to use the image

[08:52 - 08:55]
model to create a logo. And I'm going to

[08:54 - 08:57]
give it very minimal information, but

[08:55 - 08:59]
I'm also going to ask it to leverage the

[08:57 - 09:01]
memory that it has of me. So I'm going

[08:59 - 09:04]
to type in generate a minimalist owl

[09:01 - 09:06]
logo in my hex colors. I'm going to

[09:04 - 09:08]
click on create an image. And again

[09:06 - 09:09]
we're using the 40 model here. And let's

[09:08 - 09:12]
see what it comes up with. All right.

[09:09 - 09:15]
And here's my minimalist owl logo in my

[09:12 - 09:17]
hex colors. This is very minimal. And I

[09:15 - 09:20]
would say that it could be a little bit

[09:17 - 09:22]
more colorful with my hex colors, but

[09:20 - 09:23]
not too bad. So, you can ask ChatBD for

[09:22 - 09:24]
any kind of file format that you want.

[09:23 - 09:27]
So, for example, if you want it as an

[09:24 - 09:29]
SVG extension or a PNG file, you can

[09:27 - 09:31]
just simply ask it for it, and it will

[09:29 - 09:32]
give you instructions on what to do with

[09:31 - 09:33]
that file once it gives it to you. All

[09:32 - 09:36]
right, for this next image tip with

[09:33 - 09:38]
ChatBT, you can use the image model to

[09:36 - 09:40]
create a brand avatar. I'm sure you've

[09:38 - 09:42]
seen these brand avatars going around

[09:40 - 09:44]
online. Well, we're going to create one

[09:42 - 09:46]
right now. I've written a prompt to

[09:44 - 09:48]
create a brand avatar in a specific

[09:46 - 09:51]
style. So, now all I want to do is

[09:48 - 09:52]
upload an image of me and it'll give me

[09:51 - 09:54]
a brand avatar that I can use online

[09:52 - 09:55]
maybe in social media or what have you.

[09:54 - 09:57]
All right. And let's see what it comes

[09:55 - 10:00]
up with. All right. And here is the

[09:57 - 10:02]
brand avatar that it came up with. It's

[10:00 - 10:03]
pretty good, right? But just keep in

[10:02 - 10:06]
mind that all the elements that are

[10:03 - 10:08]
included in here, including the shirt.

[10:06 - 10:11]
So, like this is the image that I gave

[10:08 - 10:13]
it. I can give it any additional

[10:11 - 10:15]
instructions in the prompt to make any

[10:13 - 10:17]
kind of changes that I want to create

[10:15 - 10:19]
this brand avatar. But as you can see

[10:17 - 10:21]
here, it did that in a matter of 90

[10:19 - 10:22]
seconds. Not too bad. All right. So for

[10:21 - 10:25]
image trick number five, now that you

[10:22 - 10:27]
can create consistent branding in your

[10:25 - 10:30]
images, let's talk about some advanced

[10:27 - 10:31]
techniques for image generation with the

[10:30 - 10:33]
40 model. And the first thing we're

[10:31 - 10:35]
going to do is use the image model to

[10:33 - 10:37]
add elements or an element to an

[10:35 - 10:39]
existing picture or image. All right. So

[10:37 - 10:42]
what I've done is I've just uploaded the

[10:39 - 10:43]
exact same image that I used previously

[10:42 - 10:45]
for the brand avatar and I just said

[10:43 - 10:48]
edit this image such that the person is

[10:45 - 10:51]
holding a coffee cup. So just to recap

[10:48 - 10:53]
this is the image that we are using and

[10:51 - 10:56]
we are hoping that it's going to add a

[10:53 - 11:00]
coffee cup to the to my hands. All right

[10:56 - 11:04]
and the image is generating the

[11:00 - 11:07]
face looks a little wonky but it's not

[11:04 - 11:10]
too bad. I think it said a good job in

[11:07 - 11:12]
the And there's the coffee cup. I mean

[11:10 - 11:15]
that is really cool, right? It looks

[11:12 - 11:18]
really natural in how I'm holding the

[11:15 - 11:20]
coffee cup with a simple prompt. Taking

[11:18 - 11:23]
an image, edit this image that the

[11:20 - 11:25]
person is holding a coffee cup. And here

[11:23 - 11:28]
it is. I would say the only thing that's

[11:25 - 11:30]
a little bit questionable is the face on

[11:28 - 11:33]
how it's done it, but it's not too bad

[11:30 - 11:34]
if this is the original. So, what I

[11:33 - 11:37]
could do on this, and I'll talk more

[11:34 - 11:39]
about this coming up also, is I could

[11:37 - 11:43]
click on the image here and go to the

[11:39 - 11:46]
little select tool and I could select

[11:43 - 11:48]
the the face and then I can describe

[11:46 - 11:50]
what I want to change or replace or edit

[11:48 - 11:51]
or or update. I could highlight the

[11:50 - 11:54]
coffee cup and I could say make the

[11:51 - 11:56]
coffee cup black or whatever it is. So

[11:54 - 11:59]
there's a lot of different ways that you

[11:56 - 12:01]
can uh edit the images in addition to

[11:59 - 12:03]
just giving it simple prompts which

[12:01 - 12:06]
we'll do in the next one because with

[12:03 - 12:08]
the next advanced technique it's what I

[12:06 - 12:11]
like to call multi-perspective

[12:08 - 12:14]
generation. So this is essentially like

[12:11 - 12:17]
you're prompting the for the same scene

[12:14 - 12:20]
to be from different viewpoints. So, I'm

[12:17 - 12:25]
going to put in a prompt here for a

[12:20 - 12:26]
castle and a dragon. And so, I'm going

[12:25 - 12:29]
to put this right in here. Actually, I'm

[12:26 - 12:31]
going to start a new chat and just going

[12:29 - 12:34]
to put that right in here. I'm going to

[12:31 - 12:36]
click on image and we'll see what comes

[12:34 - 12:37]
up with because then we can use a little

[12:36 - 12:39]
bit of iterative editing here, which

[12:37 - 12:42]
we'll talk again more about here in a

[12:39 - 12:44]
second on getting different angles and

[12:42 - 12:46]
multiple perspectives of this image. All

[12:44 - 12:49]
right. And here's the image that it

[12:46 - 12:51]
created. It's pretty good, right? Like I

[12:49 - 12:53]
sun's really cool. Detail is pretty

[12:51 - 12:57]
cool. Love the dragon there. Okay. So

[12:53 - 12:58]
now let's ask the image model here to

[12:57 - 13:00]
make a couple changes. So I'm going to

[12:58 - 13:02]
ask it to revise the image so that the

[13:00 - 13:04]
castle is seen from above. All right.

[13:02 - 13:06]
With that simple tweak, this is the

[13:04 - 13:08]
image that we just got. So as you can

[13:06 - 13:13]
see here, now we're looking down on the

[13:08 - 13:15]
castle and the dragon rather than up at

[13:13 - 13:15]
the castle and the dragon. Now, if you

[13:15 - 13:17]
wanted to, you could put that

[13:15 - 13:19]
multi-perspective generation request

[13:17 - 13:21]
right within the prompt. So, maybe

[13:19 - 13:24]
you're getting back like three different

[13:21 - 13:27]
images, the castle seen through a forest

[13:24 - 13:29]
or from a moat of the castle, and then

[13:27 - 13:31]
from above like we just did. So, you can

[13:29 - 13:32]
put that into your prompt and Chhat GPT

[13:31 - 13:34]
will give you that same image from

[13:32 - 13:35]
different perspectives. For tip number

[13:34 - 13:38]
seven, we're going to use the 40 image

[13:35 - 13:42]
model to transfer a style that we give

[13:38 - 13:44]
Chad GPT to an image. So, this is what

[13:42 - 13:46]
I've written in this prompt here. Create

[13:44 - 13:47]
a handdrawn digital illustration of the

[13:46 - 13:50]
attached image. I'm going to use the

[13:47 - 13:52]
exact same image of me before in a bold

[13:50 - 13:54]
minimal, energetic sketch style, like a

[13:52 - 13:56]
high performance concept, blah blah

[13:54 - 13:58]
blah. I've given it the hex code colors

[13:56 - 13:59]
and let's see what it gives us. All

[13:58 - 14:01]
right. And here's the output that it

[13:59 - 14:02]
just gave me. I think it's actually

[14:01 - 14:04]
really, really good, especially

[14:02 - 14:06]
considering it really did a good job

[14:04 - 14:08]
following the prompt. So, handdrawn

[14:06 - 14:10]
digital illustration of the attached

[14:08 - 14:12]
image bold minimal energetic etc.

[14:10 - 14:13]
etc. I think it did a really good job

[14:12 - 14:15]
with this. So, this is a great use case

[14:13 - 14:17]
for you for any kind of brand photos

[14:15 - 14:19]
that you have in your business, for

[14:17 - 14:21]
example, and you want to turn them into

[14:19 - 14:23]
fun sketches like this. Easy way to do

[14:21 - 14:24]
it. Did it in about 90 seconds. All

[14:23 - 14:27]
right, for tip number eight, this is all

[14:24 - 14:29]
about image expansion or outpainting.

[14:27 - 14:32]
So, this is essentially where you take

[14:29 - 14:35]
an existing image and you ask Chat GBT

[14:32 - 14:37]
to expand the image in some way. So, for

[14:35 - 14:39]
example, expand the border into some

[14:37 - 14:40]
scene that you want. So, what we're

[14:39 - 14:41]
going to do here is we're going to take

[14:40 - 14:43]
the same image that I've been using

[14:41 - 14:45]
here. So, I'm going to tell Chachi BT to

[14:43 - 14:48]
expand the attached picture into a

[14:45 - 14:50]
landscape view inside a coffee shop. So

[14:48 - 14:53]
the goal here is to put me inside a

[14:50 - 14:54]
coffee shop of the image that we've

[14:53 - 14:56]
given it. All right. And here's the

[14:54 - 14:59]
image that it just created. It's

[14:56 - 15:02]
actually pretty good. Uh, it's a little

[14:59 - 15:03]
I think I have like demon eyes, but it's

[15:02 - 15:06]
pretty good. Like, I would totally work

[15:03 - 15:09]
in a coffee shop like this. And a simple

[15:06 - 15:12]
prompt. take an original image, expand

[15:09 - 15:13]
the attach picture into a fill-in-

[15:12 - 15:16]
thelank, whatever it is that you want to

[15:13 - 15:17]
do, and chatb takes care of it in like

[15:16 - 15:20]
again 90 seconds. So that is image

[15:17 - 15:21]
expansion or outpainting. Now, the next

[15:20 - 15:23]
tip I want to talk to you about is

[15:21 - 15:25]
editing your images. We talked a little

[15:23 - 15:27]
bit about it already, but you do not

[15:25 - 15:30]
have to start from scratch necessarily

[15:27 - 15:33]
when you don't like an image. TATBT is

[15:30 - 15:35]
really good now at taking your feedback

[15:33 - 15:37]
and making edits to the image. This is

[15:35 - 15:39]
what I like to call iterative chat loop

[15:37 - 15:42]
editing. So, you're basically

[15:39 - 15:44]
continuously giving it feedback in a

[15:42 - 15:45]
loop to get it to an image quality or

[15:44 - 15:47]
something that you're really really

[15:45 - 15:50]
happy with. Basically, you're treating

[15:47 - 15:52]
the image model as you're a live art

[15:50 - 15:55]
director. So, you could say something

[15:52 - 15:58]
like, "Love it. Raise the camera. Punch

[15:55 - 16:00]
up the teal." Um, I could say with this

[15:58 - 16:04]
image right here, for example, I could

[16:00 - 16:07]
say add coffee to the uh bar back here

[16:04 - 16:10]
or add a barista behind the counter or

[16:07 - 16:11]
something like that. I could fix the I

[16:10 - 16:13]
don't know if this is like an Italian

[16:11 - 16:15]
spelling of cappuccino or not. I don't

[16:13 - 16:17]
think it is, but I could uh I could

[16:15 - 16:20]
definitely select it. I could tell

[16:17 - 16:22]
ChatPD to correct the spelling of

[16:20 - 16:25]
cappuccino, for example. So, you become

[16:22 - 16:29]
the art director of your images. just

[16:25 - 16:30]
simply giving feedback to chatbt on

[16:29 - 16:32]
whatever it's kicking out to you. And

[16:30 - 16:34]
you just repeat that process until

[16:32 - 16:35]
you're really happy with the image. For

[16:34 - 16:36]
this next tip, we're going to continue

[16:35 - 16:38]
to take everything we've learned so far

[16:36 - 16:41]
in this video and we're going to create

[16:38 - 16:43]
assets for our business in terms of

[16:41 - 16:45]
advertising. So, for example, you can

[16:43 - 16:47]
use the image model to create ad

[16:45 - 16:50]
creative. And I'm going to show you a

[16:47 - 16:52]
prompt here that very simple where we're

[16:50 - 16:54]
going to create an Instagram ad

[16:52 - 16:57]
creative. You could do this with

[16:54 - 16:59]
Facebook ads or uh Tik Tok ads or

[16:57 - 17:00]
LinkedIn ads, whatever kind of ads that

[16:59 - 17:02]
you want to be running, but I'm just

[17:00 - 17:04]
going to say create an image for my

[17:02 - 17:05]
Instagram ad creative in my branding.

[17:04 - 17:08]
Again, so I'm using the memory feature

[17:05 - 17:11]
of ChatBT that aligns with the following

[17:08 - 17:13]
ad copy. I'm purposely keeping it broad

[17:11 - 17:16]
in the exact prompt because I want

[17:13 - 17:19]
ChatBT to really get its inspiration

[17:16 - 17:21]
from the ad copy rather than me telling

[17:19 - 17:23]
it something, not giving it the ad copy.

[17:21 - 17:25]
Then there's misalignment within the

[17:23 - 17:26]
creative itself. So, let's go ahead and

[17:25 - 17:28]
see what this comes up with. All right.

[17:26 - 17:30]
And here's the image that it just

[17:28 - 17:32]
created. Not too bad. I would totally

[17:30 - 17:34]
use this for an Instagram ad creative.

[17:32 - 17:37]
And and by the way, this is actually

[17:34 - 17:38]
true. If you want to check out recall

[17:37 - 17:40]
which I talked about earlier in the

[17:38 - 17:43]
video, and you want to get 25% off, just

[17:40 - 17:46]
uh use the code recall Rick. It's linked

[17:43 - 17:48]
to in the description below. But pretty

[17:46 - 17:51]
cool, right? All I did was a simple

[17:48 - 17:54]
prompt. I included ad copy and I told it

[17:51 - 17:56]
to create an image that complements the

[17:54 - 17:59]
ad copy. Don't just replicate the ad

[17:56 - 18:00]
copy in an image, but give me a an

[17:59 - 18:02]
interesting image that I can use as ad

[18:00 - 18:04]
creative. And then I can create

[18:02 - 18:06]
different variations of this if I want.

[18:04 - 18:08]
And speaking of variations, this is the

[18:06 - 18:10]
next tip and the final tip that I want

[18:08 - 18:12]
to share with you in this video. This is

[18:10 - 18:13]
what I like to call multi- scene

[18:12 - 18:16]
storytelling. And what I mean by

[18:13 - 18:18]
multi-seen storytelling, ChachiBT the 40

[18:16 - 18:20]
image model is really good at creating

[18:18 - 18:22]
visual narratives obviously if you

[18:20 - 18:25]
prompt it correctly showing like a

[18:22 - 18:27]
specific transformation. So for example

[18:25 - 18:30]
in scene one you can say frustrated

[18:27 - 18:33]
entrepreneur scene two organizing with

[18:30 - 18:34]
tools or scene three then giving

[18:33 - 18:36]
confident presentation. So it's almost

[18:34 - 18:38]
showing the story arc this you could

[18:36 - 18:40]
actually use this for an ad creative as

[18:38 - 18:43]
well. And to do this, I'm going to show

[18:40 - 18:45]
you in the OpenAI playground. And the

[18:43 - 18:46]
reason I want to do this is because I'm

[18:45 - 18:47]
going to click on images. By the way

[18:46 - 18:50]
this again, this is the uh the

[18:47 - 18:51]
playground platform.openai.com.

[18:50 - 18:53]
And I'm going to come down here to the

[18:51 - 18:55]
bottom. I'm going to put in my prompt

[18:53 - 18:58]
that I've written for this. And you'll

[18:55 - 19:00]
notice here that it says 1x. Well, I can

[18:58 - 19:03]
choose that. And I can run the slider

[19:00 - 19:06]
along to tell it how many images, how

[19:03 - 19:09]
many variations of this image that I

[19:06 - 19:11]
want it to create. This is great because

[19:09 - 19:15]
I can't create more than one image at a

[19:11 - 19:16]
time in the normal chatbt tool. But if I

[19:15 - 19:19]
want to create different variations of

[19:16 - 19:22]
it up to 10, I'd have to use the or I

[19:19 - 19:24]
can use the playground. You just simply

[19:22 - 19:26]
click on images in the lefth hand column

[19:24 - 19:28]
here. I'm going to click on three. I'm

[19:26 - 19:29]
going to give it the prompt. And again

[19:28 - 19:32]
we're going to create our multi-seene

[19:29 - 19:33]
story telling a visual narrative. All

[19:32 - 19:36]
right. And here's the result. I think

[19:33 - 19:38]
that took like 26 seconds to generate

[19:36 - 19:41]
these images here. So, you can click on

[19:38 - 19:43]
expand and look at the image. Now, it

[19:41 - 19:47]
cut it off. I think I could have been

[19:43 - 19:50]
Now, I was pretty specific in the size

[19:47 - 19:52]
but uh 3280 x 1080 panels. Okay, I could

[19:50 - 19:55]
probably be more specific in the sizing

[19:52 - 19:57]
but you can tell here of the storyboard

[19:55 - 19:59]
that it's created for me here. And I can

[19:57 - 20:02]
go back because I looked I because I

[19:59 - 20:06]
asked it for three different variations.

[20:02 - 20:09]
So, here's the next one.

[20:06 - 20:12]
Here's the sad, organizing, and

[20:09 - 20:15]
confident. So, again, it's telling a

[20:12 - 20:17]
visual story all based on the prompt

[20:15 - 20:19]
here. And I can create, if I wanted to

[20:17 - 20:22]
I can create again up to 10 different

[20:19 - 20:24]
variations of this. And I'll often come

[20:22 - 20:27]
in here and use the playground to

[20:24 - 20:29]
generate images because I can do this.

[20:27 - 20:30]
Just a quick side note here on when

[20:29 - 20:32]
you're in the playground, you can click

[20:30 - 20:34]
on this little toy box if you will or I

[20:32 - 20:37]
don't even know what that is. A toolbox

[20:34 - 20:40]
maybe. And you can use all of these

[20:37 - 20:42]
different sort of presets. Logo, 3D

[20:40 - 20:44]
city, birthday card. They have a whole

[20:42 - 20:47]
bunch. And I think they've added to this

[20:44 - 20:48]
actually in the past little while. But

[20:47 - 20:51]
especially if you're creating like

[20:48 - 20:52]
product designs or anything like that, I

[20:51 - 20:54]
would be doing that over here in the

[20:52 - 20:56]
playground. So they because they give

[20:54 - 20:58]
you they give you some more tools. The

[20:56 - 21:00]
other thing here is you can go in here

[20:58 - 21:02]
if you're not setting in your prompt

[21:00 - 21:06]
which I still recommend that you do uh

[21:02 - 21:08]
is to go ahead and choose the uh sizing.

[21:06 - 21:10]
I would probably click on landscape. If

[21:08 - 21:12]
I'm going to do this same prompt again

[21:10 - 21:13]
I would click on landscape. You can do

[21:12 - 21:16]
quality and then click on advanced. And

[21:13 - 21:18]
you can do the different output uh

[21:16 - 21:20]
format, PNG, JPEG, WEBP. Now, one final

[21:18 - 21:22]
tip. What I would recommend that you do

[21:20 - 21:24]
if you're going to be creating images on

[21:22 - 21:28]
a regular basis, especially brand images

[21:24 - 21:30]
for your business, I would use chatbs

[21:28 - 21:32]
and then you can just use the 40 model

[21:30 - 21:34]
within the project. So you can come in

[21:32 - 21:37]
here, give your project a name. So like

[21:34 - 21:40]
maybe this is uh Instagram ad creative

[21:37 - 21:42]
and this is your Instagram ad project.

[21:40 - 21:44]
So you have the prompt, you don't have

[21:42 - 21:46]
to keep retyping it. It remembers all of

[21:44 - 21:48]
your hex codes and brand colors, etc.

[21:46 - 21:49]
etc. just do it all within the same

[21:48 - 21:51]
project. You can create different

[21:49 - 21:53]
projects for all the different image

[21:51 - 21:55]
projects that you're doing in your

[21:53 - 21:58]
business. Now, a note of caution when

[21:55 - 22:00]
you're generating images within chatp40.

[21:58 - 22:02]
This doesn't absolve your need for

[22:00 - 22:04]
creativity. Quite the contrary. A lot of

[22:02 - 22:05]
people have talking about that was like

[22:04 - 22:07]
oh, I don't have to be creative or it's

[22:05 - 22:10]
taking my creativity away. You still

[22:07 - 22:12]
have to design the image and have taste

[22:10 - 22:15]
to know what's good and also give it

[22:12 - 22:16]
feedback as to what you don't like or

[22:15 - 22:17]
the types of things that you want to

[22:16 - 22:20]
change, which is going to take a

[22:17 - 22:22]
creative eye now. You don't have to hire

[22:20 - 22:24]
a design team anymore to accomplish

[22:22 - 22:26]
these things. Right? But you can also

[22:24 - 22:27]
use the type of work that you're doing

[22:26 - 22:29]
or that we talked about here today in

[22:27 - 22:32]
the video. you can take down these now

[22:29 - 22:34]
fleshed out ideas of a design that

[22:32 - 22:36]
you're thinking about and then if you do

[22:34 - 22:36]
want to work with a design team then

[22:36 - 22:39]
give them the things that you're

[22:36 - 22:40]
creating in chatbt now they have a

[22:39 - 22:42]
stronger starting point. All right, I

[22:40 - 22:43]
hope you got a ton out of this video

[22:42 - 22:44]
here today. Again, if you're an online

[22:43 - 22:46]
entrepreneur and you're really looking

[22:44 - 22:48]
to leverage AI in your business so that

[22:46 - 22:49]
you can scale your business, streamline

[22:48 - 22:51]
it, and increase profitability in the

[22:49 - 22:53]
process. I want to invite you to join us

[22:51 - 22:55]
inside my AI playbook community. I'll

I am a total ChatGPT novice and the second time I made an image I did ask it to give me a prompt itself. It asked me a couple of questions and then created it. It was pretty good

### 2. @robertfindnature (üëç 1)
Long time subscriber here ...thanks. I like this format more then your standard format inside the studio. Honest to hearth Alston, would you recommend starting with 30 shorts or 30 videos around the 10-15 min mark?...

Incredibly useful. Thank you for the wonderfully produced college level course. I tried these tips and was blown away about the improvement in my work, plus the time saving.

### 5. @advazon (üëç 2)
It's a high value content. Thank you for sharing Rick!

### 6. @IncredibleFlyinSquid (üëç 34)
Instead of crafting prompts, have you considered building a reference document that you upload first to constrain the Image Generation through specific logic and rules? I've created several documents to simulate cameras and effects, which allows for easier application of whatever image you want so long as you have planned ahead for what the end result will be.

> **@RisingOne2See** (üëç 13): @IncredibleFlyinSquid  Can you talk more about this? Help people out with an example or two? Or explain what your logic and rules look like that simulate cameras and effects? Inquiring minds want to know! Appreciate anything you can enlighten us on.

100% disagree with #10. Chatgpt often ignores clear directions because its STILL referring to past images. Ask it to  zoom out and not cut off any parts and it will continually crop out over and over again. Ask CHATGPT if it's following your directions and it replies "no. I didn't do this and this and that. Do you want me to follow the instructions given?" And then it doesn't. Sometimes it's best just to ask to write a prompt that will do what you want,  start a new chat using the image you are working from again and say to ignore any previous chats or images and work only from the image provided.

> **@xxcourtjesterxx** (üëç 2): This is 100% my experience as well

> **@SoulfulStrategyLab** (üëç 0): yes chatgpt made my IG carousels a hot messüòÇ

> **@raguellagrande7344** (üëç 1): I think this depends how long you interact with one chat session, if we are fair.

> **@wendyon4517** (üëç 0): ‚Äã@@raguellagrande7344Yes, for sure it becomes progressively more challenging if we keep going with one chat because we want to keep the themes consistent.
I've also had it incorporate items from previous chats. Many times when making adjustments to a specific image I ask CHATGPT to describe the image they are referring to and it's a totally different image. BUT sometimes when it goes off and doesn't follow directions it comes back with something incredible that I'd never have thought of.

> **@eric.c.bullock** (üëç 2): No. I agree. AND there's considerable image quality degrading from iteration to iteration. It's not random; it gets progressively worse. ALWAYS better to start with a new chat thread

### 10. @JohnnyLeuthard (üëç 0)
Fantastic video, with awesome tips and tricks. I have an image I used to follow along and it was fun tweaking and editing an image of my dog (her name is buckeye) standing in my living room. I went from that  image, recreated it, using another AI with the prompt ChatGPT gave to recreate then used that image in ChatGPTb to remove some elements, make it a sketch, put her on a football field with Brutus doing a cartwheel in the background, added the Buckeyes colors and had her balancing a coffee mug on her he'd with her name printed on it. Crazy what you can do with AI these days!

Just subscribed, I noticed that when you did your hero lifestyle photo it did a great job of capturing your exact face. One of the challenges I have is that it never seems to get my look correct my face is always distorted or off or I‚Äôm almost unrecognizable.

Let me know if there‚Äôs any basic advice you‚Äôd have regarding this.

Thanks so much for all the prompts as well as the information, very useful. I‚Äôm excited to try it all.

### 14. @RightsRanch (üëç 4)
For my specific image needs, I find it easiest to start with an initial image premise, then build on that image with further prompts, starting with a new image each time, and the updated instructions. I have found that when I try to make changes directly to an already-generated image, the AI model screws everything up, where it becomes to far too time consuming trying to correct errors.

### 15. @LucyBlack-l6l (üëç 4)
Great tricks, thanks so much!

### 16. @EliotHochberg (üëç 3)
One thing few creators of these kind of videos are talking about is that when you create your images in this way, as far as the US patent office is concerned, your images are public domain. You cannot copyright them. And ChatGPT may have something to say about that copyright as well depending on how many images you use and whether or not you try to print them on a shirt and sell it or what have you.

According to my research so far, images generated by AI are automatically considered public domain. This is very important, especially if you decide to use this kind of technology to generate a logo. While it is an open question, it is my guess (I'm not an attorney) that if your logo in fringes on someone else's logo, you will automatically lose because your logo was generated with AI. First, you would lose if your logo was created after theirs for obvious reasons, but you would also lose even if your logo was created first, since it was generated by AI, it cannot be copyrighted, which I assume means it could also not be trademarked. All your legal opponent would have to prove is that you used an AI tool to create the logo.

This would also go for any other trade dress, so for example, if you used ChatGPT to generate the design of your website, or an advertisement, someone else if they perceived correctly that you used AI, would be able to take those images and use it for their business.

As a result, I would think very carefully about when and how I would use AI generated images. If they are incidental, or in place of stock photography, if you do not pay for exclusive use of stock photography, then I would imagine you'd be pretty safe with an AI image.

But, if you use an AI generated image as your "hero "imagery, or anything else that you want to have ownership of for your business, you would be wise to think very carefully as to what you risk if someone decides to use the exact same image for their business, especially if they compete against you.

While you may be able to win a case about this sort of thing, it's unlikely that you would, because if I buy a non-exclusive license for stock photography, I can't sue a competitor for using the exact same photo who has also paid for a non-exclusive license. It appears that using AI in this way would fall under the same judgment.

> **@Steve757-fl1hd** (üëç 0): I asked ChatGPT this very question. Chat told me anything I write or have sketched is all mine and only all mine. I have read about several authors that have written novel or books using Chat. They filed for copyright protections. They got their copyrights. Can you sight an example where authors were not able to copyright or publish ‚Äútheir‚Äù writings? If so, I‚Äôd be interested to hear the circumstances.

21:05 Do you need to have a subscription for the playground? Do you find it better than Sora? I'm looking at using that for book images.
