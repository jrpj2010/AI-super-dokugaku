[00:00 - 00:06]
It is easier than ever before to build

[00:02 - 00:09]
AI agents in 2025.

[00:06 - 00:12]
AI agent AI agent agent capabilities

[00:09 - 00:14]
agents. Hi everyone, I'm Ishan Sharma

[00:12 - 00:16]
and the best skill you can learn in 2025

[00:14 - 00:18]
is how to build and sell AI agents.

[00:16 - 00:21]
Today in this video, I'm going to show

[00:18 - 00:23]
you how to build AI agents effortlessly

[00:21 - 00:25]
without knowing how to code by simply

[00:23 - 00:27]
using make.com. It's going to be a

[00:25 - 00:30]
stepbystep tutorial. Watch till the end

[00:27 - 00:32]
because we'll be building a personal

[00:30 - 00:34]
assistant agent. This agent is going to

[00:32 - 00:36]
help you plan your entire day, tell you

[00:34 - 00:38]
what events you have on your calendar,

[00:36 - 00:41]
help you prepare for those events. It's

[00:38 - 00:43]
also going to help you summarize all of

[00:41 - 00:45]
your emails for the day. It will help

[00:43 - 00:47]
you reply to those emails as well, and

[00:45 - 00:49]
give you answers to any question that

[00:47 - 00:51]
you might have. All of this packed into

[00:49 - 00:54]
one agent itself. I'll show you how to

[00:51 - 00:56]
make it. make.com just had an amazing

[00:54 - 00:58]
new update in which it allows you to now

[00:56 - 01:01]
create agents from scratch right in

[00:58 - 01:04]
make.com again with no coding experience

[01:01 - 01:06]
simply by dragging and dropping and that

[01:04 - 01:07]
is what we'll be having a look at today.

[01:06 - 01:09]
So hit the like button and subscribe and

[01:07 - 01:12]
let's jump into the laptop and have a

[01:09 - 01:14]
look at make.com. So this as you can see

[01:12 - 01:16]
is make.com. It's an amazing platform

[01:14 - 01:19]
with which you can build automations

[01:16 - 01:21]
that can scale. Now they have the latest

[01:19 - 01:23]
update which allows you to create AI

[01:21 - 01:26]
agents. So let me log into it. Let me

[01:23 - 01:28]
sign in. You can make a free account.

[01:26 - 01:30]
Now I've made a separate video talking

[01:28 - 01:32]
about how to make simple AI automations

[01:30 - 01:35]
using make.com. We built a lead

[01:32 - 01:38]
generation scenario and I'm going to

[01:35 - 01:40]
show you how to build AI agents today.

[01:38 - 01:42]
So this is what make AI agents look

[01:40 - 01:46]
like. You can basically go ahead and

[01:42 - 01:48]
click on create an agent. We will

[01:46 - 01:51]
basically go ahead and say let's just

[01:48 - 01:54]
say that this agent is our personal

[01:51 - 01:56]
assistant. The model we can use any

[01:54 - 01:58]
model. I'll just go with 2.0 flash and

[01:56 - 02:00]
the system prompt. This is very

[01:58 - 02:04]
important. You can literally just go to

[02:00 - 02:04]
chat GPT and ask it

[02:05 - 02:13]
generate question I might

[02:10 - 02:16]
have and chat GPD is going to give you a

[02:13 - 02:19]
welldetailed in-depth prompt for exactly

[02:16 - 02:22]
this. Right? So what we'll do is we'll

[02:19 - 02:27]
basically just have to copy this entire

[02:22 - 02:28]
prompt and paste it inside of that box

[02:27 - 02:30]
right here.

[02:28 - 02:32]
And as you can see now you have an

[02:30 - 02:35]
in-depth prompt. You can click on save.

[02:32 - 02:38]
And once you do that, there you go. This

[02:35 - 02:41]
is your AI agent right here on mate.com.

[02:38 - 02:43]
But what does it lack? It lacks system

[02:41 - 02:45]
tools. Now you gave it a system prompt

[02:43 - 02:48]
which is going to help it get an idea

[02:45 - 02:50]
for what all you have to do. Right? So

[02:48 - 02:52]
it says you are a proactive, intelligent

[02:50 - 02:54]
and efficient personal assistant for

[02:52 - 02:56]
Ishan Sharma. Your job is to help him

[02:54 - 02:57]
organize and optimize his day, manage

[02:56 - 02:59]
his communications and answer any

[02:57 - 03:02]
queries that he might have with accuracy

[02:59 - 03:03]
and clarity. You have to do day

[03:02 - 03:05]
planning. You have to do email

[03:03 - 03:08]
management. You have to just provide

[03:05 - 03:10]
general knowledge support. So that's

[03:08 - 03:13]
what the prompt is. But it also needs to

[03:10 - 03:16]
have some tools. So any AI agent is

[03:13 - 03:19]
basically a large language model which

[03:16 - 03:21]
has access to tools to actions that it

[03:19 - 03:24]
can do. So what you can basically do is

[03:21 - 03:26]
you can go here and start adding tools.

[03:24 - 03:28]
Now we will have to create these tools

[03:26 - 03:31]
from scratch which is what I'm going to

[03:28 - 03:35]
show you right now. So let's first of

[03:31 - 03:37]
all go onto scenarios and we can start

[03:35 - 03:40]
building scenarios from scratch. And

[03:37 - 03:42]
once we do that we can basically add

[03:40 - 03:45]
those scenarios as tools into our AI

[03:42 - 03:47]
agent for it to access those tools and

[03:45 - 03:49]
execute certain functions. For example,

[03:47 - 03:51]
a function could be summarizing all of

[03:49 - 03:53]
your emails. So that is going to be one

[03:51 - 03:56]
scenario. Another function could be

[03:53 - 03:57]
looking at the events in your calendar

[03:56 - 03:59]
and giving you a summary and planning

[03:57 - 04:00]
your day. That is another scenario that

[03:59 - 04:02]
we can create. So let me just go ahead

[04:00 - 04:06]
and create a new scenario right here on

[04:02 - 04:09]
make.com. And we will start with our

[04:06 - 04:11]
first app. This one is going to be a

[04:09 - 04:14]
Telegram bot, right? So let's say that

[04:11 - 04:16]
you can access this agent on Telegram.

[04:14 - 04:19]
So, we'll just go ahead and go for

[04:16 - 04:22]
Telegram bot and I want to watch for

[04:19 - 04:24]
updates. So, I'll just go ahead and do

[04:22 - 04:27]
this. I have already created a web hook.

[04:24 - 04:30]
Now, you can add a web hook right here

[04:27 - 04:34]
and we will go ahead and keep it like

[04:30 - 04:37]
so. And I will click on save and we will

[04:34 - 04:39]
be able to save this as a Telegram bot.

[04:37 - 04:41]
Now, you can very easily go on to

[04:39 - 04:44]
Telegram and once you do that, you can

[04:41 - 04:46]
build your own bot from scratch. So all

[04:44 - 04:50]
you have to do is to basically just go

[04:46 - 04:52]
here and just say forward slash newbot

[04:50 - 04:53]
and this will help you create a new bot.

[04:52 - 04:55]
It will ask you for the name. So you

[04:53 - 04:57]
give it a name and then you will have a

[04:55 - 04:59]
bot ready for you to use in telegram

[04:57 - 05:02]
itself. Once you do that there is going

[04:59 - 05:04]
to be this little token that you can

[05:02 - 05:07]
basically copy and you can then paste

[05:04 - 05:10]
this token right into this telegram bot

[05:07 - 05:12]
when you are adding a web hook. So

[05:10 - 05:13]
basically you go on to connection, you

[05:12 - 05:15]
add a connection and you enter this

[05:13 - 05:17]
token right here which I've already

[05:15 - 05:20]
entered before. So I don't have to do

[05:17 - 05:22]
this all the way again. So this should

[05:20 - 05:24]
be good to go. And now we have a

[05:22 - 05:27]
telegram bot which will watch for

[05:24 - 05:29]
replies and messages. Okay, that is the

[05:27 - 05:31]
first step. The next step is for me to

[05:29 - 05:34]
create a router. So I want to have a if

[05:31 - 05:37]
else condition here. If I am messaging

[05:34 - 05:39]
that I want you to plan my day, then it

[05:37 - 05:41]
should access my Google calendar and

[05:39 - 05:43]
then plan my day using a Gemini module

[05:41 - 05:45]
and then give me a response afterwards.

[05:43 - 05:48]
If it does not say plan my day, I can

[05:45 - 05:50]
ask it to do something else. So for that

[05:48 - 05:53]
I need a router. So I'll go ahead and

[05:50 - 05:54]
search for a router module which is

[05:53 - 05:57]
right here. And as you can see now I

[05:54 - 05:59]
have two different conditions. So the

[05:57 - 06:05]
first condition I can set up a filter

[05:59 - 06:10]
and I can say label um check for plan my

[06:05 - 06:13]
day request the condition is going to be

[06:10 - 06:16]
basically on the text that we get. So

[06:13 - 06:19]
the message text right so you can

[06:16 - 06:21]
basically just drag and drop the output

[06:19 - 06:23]
from this telegram bot is all of this

[06:21 - 06:25]
information. Now we go into the message

[06:23 - 06:27]
section. We can drag and drop the text

[06:25 - 06:30]
part of it. Right? And then we can

[06:27 - 06:33]
basically say equals to or contains

[06:30 - 06:37]
contains case insensitive. So I can say

[06:33 - 06:40]
plan my day. And that's all you need.

[06:37 - 06:43]
And you can then click on save. So this

[06:40 - 06:47]
is going to execute if the message

[06:43 - 06:50]
contains plan my day. And now we can

[06:47 - 06:53]
start by adding our Google calendar. Now

[06:50 - 06:55]
I want it to search for all the events.

[06:53 - 06:56]
If I'm asking it to plan my day, it

[06:55 - 06:59]
first needs to have a look at the

[06:56 - 07:02]
current events in my day itself. So I'm

[06:59 - 07:04]
going to ask it to search events. And

[07:02 - 07:06]
now I have already connected my Google

[07:04 - 07:08]
calendar with make.com. You can

[07:06 - 07:10]
basically just click on add and it will

[07:08 - 07:13]
ask you to sign in with Google and give

[07:10 - 07:15]
it permission to read your Google

[07:13 - 07:16]
calendar. So you give it the permission

[07:15 - 07:19]
and then you will have access to it like

[07:16 - 07:21]
I have it right here. Now, there is a

[07:19 - 07:23]
calendar ID that I can set. So, I'll

[07:21 - 07:27]
just go ahead and click on this primary

[07:23 - 07:31]
calendar ID. Start date. It's pretty

[07:27 - 07:36]
much up to me, but I can actually keep

[07:31 - 07:39]
it to now. So, now is going to be the

[07:36 - 07:44]
date and the end date is basically going

[07:39 - 07:48]
to be now + 1. So basically what I want

[07:44 - 07:52]
is I want it to look at my calendar from

[07:48 - 07:54]
this particular time to the next one day

[07:52 - 07:57]
and I wanted to scan for all the events

[07:54 - 08:00]
in this particular time and when it does

[07:57 - 08:02]
that it's going to be able to fetch all

[08:00 - 08:05]
of my events in that particular time.

[08:02 - 08:07]
Click on select all and we can limit it

[08:05 - 08:09]
by let's just say five for now. can

[08:07 - 08:12]
click on save and now we have a Google

[08:09 - 08:15]
calendar module which will search all of

[08:12 - 08:19]
the events. Now I wanted to take this

[08:15 - 08:21]
input into a Gemini LLM. So I'll go onto

[08:19 - 08:24]
Google Gemini AI module and I'll click

[08:21 - 08:25]
on create a completion. So create a

[08:24 - 08:28]
completion is basically how you get a

[08:25 - 08:30]
reply from Gemini. Now I'm going to

[08:28 - 08:32]
create a connection. So you can add a

[08:30 - 08:35]
connection and enter your API key which

[08:32 - 08:37]
you can access by simply going on to AI.

[08:35 - 08:40]
studio which is basically Google AI

[08:37 - 08:43]
studio and you can click on get API

[08:40 - 08:46]
keys. So once this thing loads up click

[08:43 - 08:48]
on get API key and you can basically

[08:46 - 08:51]
create an API key right here and then

[08:48 - 08:52]
utilize that. So once you do that you

[08:51 - 08:54]
can basically then click on save and

[08:52 - 08:56]
then you would have a good to go Gemini

[08:54 - 08:58]
connection right here. I already have

[08:56 - 09:00]
this saved up right here so I won't do

[08:58 - 09:03]
it again. The model I'll just go with a

[09:00 - 09:05]
very well- tested model which is Gemini

[09:03 - 09:08]
2.0 flash. Now I'll go into the

[09:05 - 09:11]
messages. Role would be user, parts

[09:08 - 09:14]
would be text. And this is where I can

[09:11 - 09:17]
enter the prompt that I want Gemini to

[09:14 - 09:20]
look at. So this is where I'm going to

[09:17 - 09:23]
ask Gemini to give me the complete plan

[09:20 - 09:25]
of my day. Look at it one by one and

[09:23 - 09:26]
give me exactly what to do next. So if I

[09:25 - 09:29]
enter this text, which is basically

[09:26 - 09:30]
based on the following calendar events,

[09:29 - 09:32]
create a detailed and motivational day

[09:30 - 09:34]
plan for me. include time block

[09:32 - 09:37]
suggestions for work, meals, exercise

[09:34 - 09:41]
and breaks. The event is going to be

[09:37 - 09:44]
this summary and then this start. So

[09:41 - 09:46]
what you can also do is before we go

[09:44 - 09:50]
ahead with this Gemini module, let me

[09:46 - 09:53]
just delete this and start with a text

[09:50 - 09:56]
aggregator. So this is a way for us to

[09:53 - 09:59]
take all of the text together. The model

[09:56 - 10:03]
would be Google calendar. Text would be

[09:59 - 10:08]
the result that we get from

[10:03 - 10:12]
it. Um, which is going to be

[10:08 - 10:16]
summary at start time. So, we'll go

[10:12 - 10:18]
ahead and put that and then we will put

[10:16 - 10:20]
a row separator and then we'll click on

[10:18 - 10:23]
save. So what this does is it basically

[10:20 - 10:25]
looks at your Google calendar and it's

[10:23 - 10:27]
going to check for events one by one and

[10:25 - 10:30]
give you those events. Now if you don't

[10:27 - 10:32]
add this text aggregator, it will keep

[10:30 - 10:35]
firing Gemini again and again. So it

[10:32 - 10:36]
will get just one event and then will

[10:35 - 10:38]
try to plan your entire day around it.

[10:36 - 10:40]
Let's say you have four meetings in a

[10:38 - 10:42]
particular day. If you don't use text

[10:40 - 10:44]
aggregator, it will give you one event

[10:42 - 10:45]
to Gemini and the Gemini will think that

[10:44 - 10:47]
okay, you only have one meeting. Then it

[10:45 - 10:49]
will plan your day accordingly. then it

[10:47 - 10:51]
will get another the next meeting then

[10:49 - 10:52]
it will plan the entire day accordingly.

[10:51 - 10:54]
So it will send you multiple messages

[10:52 - 10:57]
and multiple responses which you want to

[10:54 - 11:00]
avoid. So you want Google calendar to

[10:57 - 11:03]
give you just one complete answer with

[11:00 - 11:05]
all of the events lined up in one text

[11:03 - 11:07]
field which is what you will get with

[11:05 - 11:11]
text aggregator. So I set it up like

[11:07 - 11:13]
that and I can save it and I can add

[11:11 - 11:17]
another module which would be our Gemini

[11:13 - 11:19]
bot right here. create a completion. You

[11:17 - 11:22]
can add a connection. So you can

[11:19 - 11:25]
basically oh wait a minute you can

[11:22 - 11:26]
basically click on add and get your API

[11:25 - 11:29]
key from Google AI studio. So click on

[11:26 - 11:31]
get API key and then you can paste that

[11:29 - 11:33]
key for completely free and create a

[11:31 - 11:36]
connection. I already have one so I will

[11:33 - 11:39]
not do that again. You can go and add

[11:36 - 11:43]
any model. I'll go with Gemini 2.0

[11:39 - 11:44]
flash. And then we can add our message.

[11:43 - 11:47]
So I'll go ahead and click on role of

[11:44 - 11:49]
user parts would be message type would

[11:47 - 11:53]
be text and then we can enter the actual

[11:49 - 11:57]
text which we receive from the tools. So

[11:53 - 12:00]
what we have to basically do here is

[11:57 - 12:02]
create this prompt. So based on the

[12:00 - 12:04]
following calendar events create a

[12:02 - 12:06]
detailed and motivational day plan for

[12:04 - 12:09]
me include time block suggestions for

[12:06 - 12:12]
work, meals, exercise and breaks and

[12:09 - 12:14]
then I can write down all the events. So

[12:12 - 12:16]
this is going to be the output I get

[12:14 - 12:20]
from the text aggregator which is I've

[12:16 - 12:24]
mentioned right here. Keep the

[12:20 - 12:26]
response to less

[12:24 - 12:29]
than,000 characters. Right? This is

[12:26 - 12:30]
important because Gemini often gives you

[12:29 - 12:32]
a very long reply which you do not

[12:30 - 12:35]
really want. So now we're going to go

[12:32 - 12:38]
ahead and click on save. I think that

[12:35 - 12:41]
looks good. And let's just, you know,

[12:38 - 12:42]
test it out once and let's wait for a

[12:41 - 12:45]
message. So I'll go ahead into this

[12:42 - 12:49]
particular bot and I'll say let's just

[12:45 - 12:52]
say plan my day and it should get a

[12:49 - 12:54]
response which I got right here and then

[12:52 - 12:57]
it gave us an error in Google calendar.

[12:54 - 12:59]
Let's have a look at this. So it says um

[12:57 - 13:02]
invalid date and parameter time max.

[12:59 - 13:04]
Okay, we need to fix this right now. We

[13:02 - 13:06]
can fix it by by writing this and then

[13:04 - 13:08]
we can click on save. And now let's try

[13:06 - 13:11]
to save this one. And let's try to run

[13:08 - 13:14]
this once again.

[13:11 - 13:16]
Let me again say plan my day please. You

[13:14 - 13:19]
can write anything as long as it has

[13:16 - 13:21]
plan my day in it. It should work. So as

[13:19 - 13:24]
you can see it's going to go ahead and

[13:21 - 13:26]
go through the router. It has plan my

[13:24 - 13:30]
day text. So it went through the tools

[13:26 - 13:34]
and we got the response in Gemini AI

[13:30 - 13:37]
which is now if you go in the output you

[13:34 - 13:39]
get the result. So you get this as the

[13:37 - 13:41]
entire day plan right? So this is what

[13:39 - 13:44]
we basically have. Now we need to

[13:41 - 13:47]
receive this as well. So we'll go on to

[13:44 - 13:50]
Telegram and then we'll go on to send a

[13:47 - 13:52]
message or reply. And right here we can

[13:50 - 13:55]
basically just go on to our particular

[13:52 - 13:57]
bot. You can click on the chat ID which

[13:55 - 14:00]
we can derive right from our telegram

[13:57 - 14:03]
message. So whoever sent us this message

[14:00 - 14:05]
will have a chat ID. So I'll go on to

[14:03 - 14:08]
chat and I'll just take this ID and drop

[14:05 - 14:11]
drag and drop it in the chat ID section.

[14:08 - 14:14]
And that should be good to go. And then

[14:11 - 14:16]
we have the text section which is

[14:14 - 14:19]
basically going to be the response from

[14:16 - 14:22]
the Google Gemini AI. So I'll go ahead

[14:19 - 14:25]
and grab this result and paste it right

[14:22 - 14:28]
here. And everything else should just be

[14:25 - 14:31]
okay. And once we save this, we can now

[14:28 - 14:35]
go ahead and run this automation. Now,

[14:31 - 14:37]
if I again go here and say, "Plan my

[14:35 - 14:41]
day," it should get back to

[14:37 - 14:44]
me with a reply. So, let's go back here.

[14:41 - 14:46]
And this is my one simple message. It's

[14:44 - 14:49]
going to help me plan my day in less

[14:46 - 14:51]
than a,000 characters. Very simple to

[14:49 - 14:54]
set up. Doesn't take a lot of time. And

[14:51 - 14:56]
now you have one scenario ready to go.

[14:54 - 14:58]
How cool is that? If that sounds

[14:56 - 15:00]
exciting, if you've already built this

[14:58 - 15:01]
to this point, hit the like button. Let

[15:00 - 15:03]
me know also in the comment section if

[15:01 - 15:05]
you have any questions about what I'm

[15:03 - 15:07]
doing right now. But this is the router.

[15:05 - 15:09]
We can also set one more condition. So

[15:07 - 15:12]
we can say it set up a filter and we can

[15:09 - 15:16]
ask it

[15:12 - 15:20]
um any other query. So if it has any

[15:16 - 15:23]
other question if you're asking um the

[15:20 - 15:30]
condition is going to be from the

[15:23 - 15:33]
message that we get. So the text and

[15:30 - 15:36]
contains does not contain actually. So

[15:33 - 15:39]
does not contain plan my day. So if you

[15:36 - 15:42]
do not have this as a message and we can

[15:39 - 15:44]
just click on save. So if you don't say

[15:42 - 15:46]
plan my day in your message then any

[15:44 - 15:48]
other query will pass through this other

[15:46 - 15:51]
condition. So we can again attach it to

[15:48 - 15:55]
a Gemini AI which will be to create a

[15:51 - 15:57]
completion. We can again hook it up with

[15:55 - 16:01]
a 2.0

[15:57 - 16:04]
flash message is role is user parts

[16:01 - 16:08]
message type is text and the text is

[16:04 - 16:10]
going to be the message we got as the

[16:08 - 16:12]
question. So we can basically say that

[16:10 - 16:14]
you are a smart concise AI assistant.

[16:12 - 16:16]
Answer the following question clearly

[16:14 - 16:18]
and helpfully. And then I can basically

[16:16 - 16:23]
paste in the question which is the

[16:18 - 16:24]
response I get from the Gemini AI if I

[16:23 - 16:26]
can see

[16:24 - 16:28]
that. Um so that that's going to be from

[16:26 - 16:31]
the message itself. So that is going to

[16:28 - 16:36]
be text. So I'll paste the text right

[16:31 - 16:39]
here and I can now save this as it is.

[16:36 - 16:41]
Let's let's try running this right now

[16:39 - 16:42]
and seeing what happens. So I'm going to

[16:41 - 16:47]
ask a different question this time. I'll

[16:42 - 16:49]
say why is the sky blue and it should

[16:47 - 16:52]
get back to me with a message from

[16:49 - 16:57]
Gemini itself. Let's wait and

[16:52 - 16:57]
watch. Does it work or does it not

[16:58 - 17:02]
work? Okay, I don't think this works.

[17:00 - 17:03]
Let's see. Let's see what's happening.

[17:02 - 17:06]
Okay, it does work. Okay, we don't have

[17:03 - 17:08]
the message um send message feature

[17:06 - 17:11]
right here. So, let's quickly add that

[17:08 - 17:15]
that. So, we'll go send a message. Um,

[17:11 - 17:19]
the bot is this one. The chat ID is from

[17:15 - 17:21]
the bot itself, which is right

[17:19 - 17:25]
here. And the text is going to be the

[17:21 - 17:28]
response from the Gemini AI. And that is

[17:25 - 17:31]
all that we need. Let me try saving this

[17:28 - 17:34]
once again. And let's try running this.

[17:31 - 17:38]
And let me ask a different question.

[17:34 - 17:42]
Um, how tall is Empire

[17:38 - 17:43]
State Building? Let's see. Should get

[17:42 - 17:46]
back to me with the answer. The Empire

[17:43 - 17:47]
State Building is this feet tall to the

[17:46 - 17:50]
tip of its lightning rod. And there you

[17:47 - 17:52]
go. You have a ready to go scenario

[17:50 - 17:54]
which is going to help you plan your day

[17:52 - 17:56]
or it can also help you answer any of

[17:54 - 17:58]
the questions that you might have built

[17:56 - 18:00]
right in front of you without writing a

[17:58 - 18:01]
single line of code. How cool is that?

[18:00 - 18:03]
So, this is one scenario. Let's build

[18:01 - 18:05]
one more scenario so that our agent can

[18:03 - 18:08]
actually have more tools to use. So we

[18:05 - 18:12]
would basically save this once

[18:08 - 18:17]
again. We can call this

[18:12 - 18:18]
um scenario one for our agent. Let's

[18:17 - 18:20]
make one more scenario right here. So

[18:18 - 18:22]
I'll quickly go ahead and show you how

[18:20 - 18:24]
to do it. Let's try to make a scenario

[18:22 - 18:26]
which will help us summarize our emails.

[18:24 - 18:30]
So we would first of all need to get

[18:26 - 18:32]
access to Gmail watch emails. So this is

[18:30 - 18:35]
going to get access to all of your

[18:32 - 18:37]
emails. Now you need to login into this

[18:35 - 18:39]
to give you access. So you basically can

[18:37 - 18:40]
click on add and sign in with your

[18:39 - 18:42]
Google account. Give it access to your

[18:40 - 18:45]
email. I have already given it access to

[18:42 - 18:48]
a email. I'll keep the folder as all

[18:45 - 18:52]
mail. Let's see if that works. All mail

[18:48 - 18:54]
is good to go. And everything else looks

[18:52 - 18:57]
nice. Let's put the maximum number of

[18:54 - 19:00]
results to five. Mark emails as read.

[18:57 - 19:03]
Show advanced settings.

[19:00 - 19:06]
And you basically now have an ability to

[19:03 - 19:08]
read all the emails, right? So let's

[19:06 - 19:11]
just click on save. The criteria is

[19:08 - 19:14]
going to be all emails. And now we can

[19:11 - 19:16]
save the emails. Emails after a specific

[19:14 - 19:16]
date. All

[19:17 - 19:23]
emails. Date. Let's just put the date to

[19:20 - 19:26]
be I don't know

[19:23 - 19:29]
20 25th. Let's go with that.

[19:26 - 19:31]
And now we have this one module which

[19:29 - 19:33]
will check for all the emails. Let's say

[19:31 - 19:36]
I want to summarize these emails, right?

[19:33 - 19:39]
So what do we do about that? We can

[19:36 - 19:41]
basically add a module which is going to

[19:39 - 19:43]
look at all of these emails. So we'll

[19:41 - 19:46]
have a

[19:43 - 19:49]
Gemini. It will help us summarize and

[19:46 - 19:50]
create a response. Again the same thing,

[19:49 - 19:54]
create a simple connection. Add your API

[19:50 - 19:57]
key. We'll add 2.0 flash once again

[19:54 - 19:59]
because it's fast. It's simple. It is

[19:57 - 20:02]
reliable. We'll add the role to be user

[19:59 - 20:04]
paths to be message type to be text and

[20:02 - 20:07]
then the actual text itself. Now, this

[20:04 - 20:10]
is where we need to enter uh what do we

[20:07 - 20:12]
want this module to do. So, we wanted to

[20:10 - 20:15]
look at all of our emails, summarize

[20:12 - 20:18]
those emails, and then get back to me

[20:15 - 20:19]
with a solid reply and give me

[20:18 - 20:21]
suggestions on how to reply to those

[20:19 - 20:24]
emails as well. Now what we can also do

[20:21 - 20:26]
is instead of going through this one by

[20:24 - 20:28]
one we can simply just you know delete

[20:26 - 20:30]
this module attach it to a text

[20:28 - 20:34]
aggregator. Gmail watch emails text

[20:30 - 20:36]
would be the reply we get subject and

[20:34 - 20:39]
the

[20:36 - 20:40]
text sent

[20:39 - 20:44]
by

[20:40 - 20:49]
the sender

[20:44 - 20:52]
name from the email address.

[20:49 - 20:55]
Yeah. And then we can

[20:52 - 20:57]
basically have a row separator. So we'll

[20:55 - 21:00]
have a new row. And we can now save all

[20:57 - 21:03]
of this. And now we can attach our final

[21:00 - 21:07]
module to create a

[21:03 - 21:11]
completion. And this should be better.

[21:07 - 21:14]
So let's just go with 2.0 flash. Um I'll

[21:11 - 21:20]
go with role to be user paths to be text

[21:14 - 21:23]
and the text itself. So you are an email

[21:20 - 21:28]
manager. Your role is to

[21:23 - 21:30]
look at the below emails, summarize them

[21:28 - 21:34]
and

[21:30 - 21:38]
suggest a reply to each,

[21:34 - 21:42]
a twoline reply to each for

[21:38 - 21:45]
example emails. And let's just you know

[21:42 - 21:47]
write uh the text that we get from the

[21:45 - 21:50]
text aggregator. Then we can click on

[21:47 - 21:52]
save. And then what we can do is we can

[21:50 - 21:54]
take this response and we can send it as

[21:52 - 21:57]
a email as well. So let's just go to

[21:54 - 21:59]
Gmail and send an email. Let's go with

[21:57 - 22:01]
that. Now again you need to add a

[21:59 - 22:03]
connection if you have not already. And

[22:01 - 22:06]
this is where we can set where do you

[22:03 - 22:10]
want to send this email. Now I can send

[22:06 - 22:13]
it to my work email which is this one

[22:10 - 22:18]
right here. And the subject could

[22:13 - 22:23]
basically be your email

[22:18 - 22:25]
report. And we can also have the content

[22:23 - 22:28]
which would actually be the result

[22:25 - 22:31]
itself. That's all you need. Um we can

[22:28 - 22:35]
quickly just click on

[22:31 - 22:38]
save. And this is our simple scenario

[22:35 - 22:41]
which is going to give us check all of

[22:38 - 22:43]
our emails, take them together, give it

[22:41 - 22:46]
to Gemini to summarize it to give us a

[22:43 - 22:48]
reply and then send it back to another

[22:46 - 22:50]
email of ours. So let me give you an

[22:48 - 22:51]
example of what that would look like. So

[22:50 - 22:55]
if I run this once, I basically have to

[22:51 - 22:58]
send an email to hey and be like uh sup

[22:55 - 23:03]
and I can get back by saying

[22:58 - 23:07]
um what do you think is the deadline for

[23:03 - 23:10]
the project we are doing with Google and

[23:07 - 23:12]
then we can basically just send this

[23:10 - 23:14]
email and let's see what happens. So it

[23:12 - 23:17]
got one email, it sent it to the text

[23:14 - 23:20]
aggregator, it sent it to the summarizer

[23:17 - 23:23]
and then send that as an email itself.

[23:20 - 23:26]
So this is working flawlessly. We can to

[23:23 - 23:29]
testify to see if it works. We can

[23:26 - 23:32]
always just go to our actual email and

[23:29 - 23:34]
get this as a report. Okay, here's a

[23:32 - 23:37]
here's a summary and the suggested email

[23:34 - 23:40]
for the each email from Don Pivot

[23:37 - 23:43]
partners. We got some email and it is

[23:40 - 23:46]
giving us this huge chunk of text. Now

[23:43 - 23:48]
we can always make it more structured

[23:46 - 23:50]
but this is just an example of how the

[23:48 - 23:53]
summarizer and replier would actually

[23:50 - 23:55]
work. So this is basically how it works.

[23:53 - 23:58]
We've built two scenarios now. Now all

[23:55 - 24:01]
we have to do is let's just say uh

[23:58 - 24:04]
scenario two for our agent and we can

[24:01 - 24:05]
basically just save this. And once we do

[24:04 - 24:09]
that, let's go

[24:05 - 24:13]
back to the main agents and we can turn

[24:09 - 24:14]
this on as well. And once we do that, if

[24:13 - 24:18]
you go

[24:14 - 24:20]
back, you basically should be having two

[24:18 - 24:22]
scenarios which are working for us and

[24:20 - 24:23]
we can add that to our agent and then

[24:22 - 24:26]
our agent would be good to go. Now you

[24:23 - 24:29]
can change the schedule to on demand and

[24:26 - 24:32]
then save it right here. And then this

[24:29 - 24:34]
would be available as a scenario to add

[24:32 - 24:38]
in our agent as well. So now if we go

[24:34 - 24:39]
into our agent, we have our system

[24:38 - 24:41]
prompt which I already showed you. This

[24:39 - 24:44]
is the system prompt. But then we also

[24:41 - 24:46]
have access to tools. We click on this.

[24:44 - 24:50]
You can basically add scenario one and

[24:46 - 24:53]
scenario two. So we'll click on this and

[24:50 - 24:57]
then we can add both of them into our

[24:53 - 25:01]
agent like so. Then we can just click on

[24:57 - 25:02]
save and now this agent is good to go.

[25:01 - 25:05]
There are so many apps you can actually

[25:02 - 25:07]
be using but I'm just giving you a very

[25:05 - 25:12]
simple example of using Telegram bot in

[25:07 - 25:16]
which I can basically watch for

[25:12 - 25:19]
updates and we can again you know add

[25:16 - 25:23]
our bot. Click on

[25:19 - 25:25]
save. We can save this and now we can

[25:23 - 25:28]
ask any question to this current bot

[25:25 - 25:31]
that we have because after this we can

[25:28 - 25:34]
search agents and you have the make AI

[25:31 - 25:37]
agent right here. The option is to run

[25:34 - 25:39]
an agent and now we can select the agent

[25:37 - 25:42]
that we want to run. For our case we'll

[25:39 - 25:43]
be running the personal assistant agent

[25:42 - 25:46]
which has access to both of these

[25:43 - 25:49]
scenarios right here. And now I can

[25:46 - 25:51]
basically just say save. And there you

[25:49 - 25:54]
go. This is what an agent looks like. I

[25:51 - 25:56]
can now run this. And that is literally

[25:54 - 25:58]
all you need to create an AI agent from

[25:56 - 25:59]
scratch. This is what it looks like. You

[25:58 - 26:01]
can simply message it anything you want

[25:59 - 26:03]
right here. You can ask it any

[26:01 - 26:05]
questions. You can ask it to check your

[26:03 - 26:07]
your status for the day, your plan for

[26:05 - 26:09]
the day. You can ask it to summarize all

[26:07 - 26:12]
of your emails, reply to your emails,

[26:09 - 26:15]
and it will do that effortlessly right

[26:12 - 26:18]
using make.com. This is how you create

[26:15 - 26:20]
make agents from scratch without writing

[26:18 - 26:22]
a single line of code. If you want to

[26:20 - 26:24]
learn more about make.com and how to

[26:22 - 26:25]
build agents with it, check out my

[26:24 - 26:28]
previous video I made on how to make

[26:25 - 26:30]
scenarios using make.com if you want to

[26:28 - 26:32]
understand the basics of that. But this

[26:30 - 26:35]
is an incredibly powerful platform which

[26:32 - 26:38]
can help you create any AI automation

[26:35 - 26:40]
and now AI agents as well. Go have a

[26:38 - 26:41]
look at that. Thanks a lot for watching

[26:40 - 26:43]
this video till the very end. I will see

[26:41 - 26:45]
you all in the next video. Hit the like

[26:43 - 26:47]
button and subscribe. And thanks to

[26:45 - 26:52]
make.com for sponsoring this video. I'll

[26:47 - 26:52]
see you in the next one. Bye-bye.

i have created same but each time it not shows me day schedule , sometimes it gives message like , "i am missing the calendar event ", even i add tasks on calendar

### 14. @devanshsharma486 (👍 1)
Not receiving message back in telegram ? Here's the mistake I was making : 

I was selecting the wrong "Chat" drop down button. You are supposed to be selecting the second one under MESSAGE.

### 15. @khansaa-u7x2q (👍 2)
Are you using paid version of make

### 16. @simantathakuria2907 (👍 1)
I have build one Ai Agent using n8n 14 days trial , it  was. Good one

> **@shubhamnimgade7055** (👍 1): I have tried the free trial version.
I tried to self-host N8N using Docker, but it was futile as Docker consumes a lot of RAM and CPU. Do you have any other method to self-host N8N?

### 17. @MayurParmar-p9h (👍 0)

Super detailed walkthrough! Do you think Moxby will support building agents this way too? We’re just exploring what’s possible and curious about your thoughts.
