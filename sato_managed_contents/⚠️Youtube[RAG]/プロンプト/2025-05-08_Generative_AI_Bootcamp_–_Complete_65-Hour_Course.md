### 4. @PrathameshMawlankar (👍 240)
No freaking way this is insane what you guys are doing for the community! Can’t thank you guys enough!

> **@ExamProChannel** (👍 2): Really appreciate that, means a lot to us!

### 5. @pohlondrej (👍 96)
As a participant of the bootcamp, it's the best $0 I ever spent! Jokes aside, I recommend everyone to watch this, and do all the homeworks. Get your hands dirty, and you will learn heaps.

> **@sanumehendi1317** (👍 1): Will there be a free certificate or should we pay for it😢😢😢

> **@pfever** (👍 2): how did you knew about the event before they uploaded the video here?

> **@saskakc3365** (👍 0): Would you suggest it for beginners to?, and what job opportunity's can it provide ?

> **@shivampareek3482** (👍 0): Can you pls tell me what are the prerequisites for this?

> **@sanumehendi1317** (👍 1): @ almost none but if u know basic programming it might be helpful a bit but don’t worry

### 6. @dev-raja-007 (👍 73)
65 hours of content on GenAI, it's insane! Thanks for doing this for the community ❤

> **@ExamProChannel** (👍 1): Thanks for the support! ❤

### 7. @r1shabhnegi (👍 22)
I’m beginning the course today and will be providing updates on my experience.

3 H Done -> No coding yet. But for beginners, the discussions so far are valuable. I recommend fast forward the side-topic talks. Aside from that, listen to everything with full focus.

3 - 6 H Done -> A brief overview of the Japanese language (you can fast forward it if you want, but it may be useful later). Started exploring prompting - refining the prompting seems helpful so far, though no coding yet.

6 - 10 H Done -> Topics like Bad vs. Good Architecture in Gen AI, submission review, and tweaking a coding assistant. The concepts are still at a basic level, no actual coding yet. I fast-forwarded through some sections but made sure to rewatch the important parts, especially around how to use code assistants efficiently and the differences between bad and good architecture.

10 - 15 H Done -> Data pre-processing part was fun, building backend with windsurf was okish IMO doesn't adding much value to my skillset.

15 - 18 H Done -> Learned about running models locally, but the process was unclear. I spent most of the time fixing issues without a clear approach to follow.

> **@memmudmemmed3022** (👍 2): comments like yours are invaluable. thx for your input. Did you go any further or did you feel it's not good fit for you?

> **@lazy_lepord** (👍 0): any update on this ?

> **@user-rc9qv7yz3x** (👍 2): The guy disappeared. Skynet won after 16h :)

> **@amartya8101** (👍 0): update?

> **@r1shabhnegi** (👍 3): Guys I am doing 2 jobs right now, also for OPEA and running LLM in my local setup I need a good machine so I probably need to switch to my office laptop, I will continue it in 2 to 3 days, Thanks.

### 8. @codeFlah (👍 60)
Hey, yoo. You surprise us every time with a course longer than the one before!
Awesome!! Thanks, Sir.

> **@ExamProChannel** (👍 0): Haha, you know it , glad you're enjoying them!

### 9. @saintpierre669 (👍 41)
Wow, these guys are about to start releasing whole semesters

> **@yolanda6392** (👍 6): This is the same number of hours I would spend in lectures for 3 different classes throughout a single semester

### 10. @dharanidharan8953 (👍 29)
65 hours worth of content about Gen AI. 
Thanks you guys!

> **@ExamProChannel** (👍 0): Appreciate it!🙌

### 11. @ddfelder2 (👍 6)
See… this is why I donate monthly. Soooooo worth it! The value you all provide is insane!!! THANK YOU!!!

### 12. @SuvamLama-q3t (👍 133)
The one who complete this course can apply for guinness world record for watching world longest Course ever.

> **@ExamProChannel** (👍 2): 😂

> **@shaheer_ahmed__69** (👍 2): haha so true

Exactly the video I asked for a month ago! So happy to see it’s finally here and for free! Grateful that our requests are being heard. Thank you FCC

### 14. @pianowithjash (👍 65)
finally, something light to watch before bed

> **@esog5474** (👍 0): 😂

> **@johnyousef-x8r** (👍 3): bro is still awake

> **@charliedays** (👍 2): It will make you sleep because you have to concentrate for every second that a topic is explained. So, yes, you’re guaranteed to sleep right after a few minutes.🤣

### 15. @SwatiSingh-dq2zm (👍 11)
I’m 6 hours in. He teaches fine tuning on different platform like Claude, meta ai, open ai. You can literally choose on what platform you wanna work on. The project is about learning Japanese for beginners

> **@endlesslearning26** (👍 1): hey did you do any progress , Like for me personally it is getting frustrating beyond like 10th hour as he is focusing more on the backend and frontend instead of general genai

### 16. @laizerwoolf (👍 19)
I think you guys mistitled your video, because the length is only 2 hours... waitaminute... seconds, minutes, hours, days??? 
you guys are for real the GOAT🐐

> **@ExamProChannel** (👍 1): LOL yep… not a typo. That’s 65 hours of pure learning pain 😭 Glad you’re here for the ride!

### 17. @bereketassefa9331 (👍 41)
mom: you should sleep early
