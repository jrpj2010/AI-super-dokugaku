[00:09 - 00:10]
AMINA: Chances
are you've already

[00:10 - 00:13]
experimented with generative
AI, and you've probably

[00:13 - 00:15]
gotten some results
that have been helpful,

[00:15 - 00:17]
and maybe some that fell short.

[00:17 - 00:20]
Throughout this course,
AI experts at Google

[00:20 - 00:23]
will teach you the difference
between a good prompt

[00:23 - 00:26]
and a great prompt so you
can work faster and smarter

[00:26 - 00:28]
with GenAI at your side.

[00:28 - 00:31]
And we'll share practical
examples of where

[00:31 - 00:33]
you can use GenAI at work.

[00:33 - 00:34]
Hi, I'm Amina.

[00:34 - 00:36]
I work on generative
AI at Google.

[00:36 - 00:38]
In this course, my
colleagues and I

[00:38 - 00:41]
are going to teach you how you
can get the most out of GenAI.

[00:41 - 00:43]
You'll learn when
to use GenAI and how

[00:43 - 00:46]
by designing better prompts
to get the best results.

[00:46 - 00:49]
You'll apply what you've
learned with hands-on activities

[00:49 - 00:52]
and quizzes to level up
your prompting skills.

[00:52 - 00:54]
After you've
completed this course,

[00:54 - 00:57]
you'll have lots of practice
applying GenAI in ways that

[00:57 - 00:59]
mattered to you and your job.

[00:59 - 01:02]
As recognition of
your work, you'll

[01:02 - 01:04]
earn a certificate from Google
to share with your network

[01:04 - 01:06]
and potential employers.

[01:06 - 01:09]
We have a lot of exciting stuff
in store, so let's get to it.

[01:21 - 01:24]
TIMOTHY: Hi, I'm Timothy, a
director of developer relations

[01:24 - 01:25]
at Google.

[01:25 - 01:27]
For the last 14 years, I've
been helping developers

[01:27 - 01:30]
and Google work better together.

[01:30 - 01:32]
I've recently been working
a lot more with GenAI

[01:32 - 01:35]
to do things like technical
writing and generating code.

[01:35 - 01:38]
I've also been helping more
developers integrate GenAI

[01:38 - 01:39]
into their apps.

[01:39 - 01:42]
Prompting is a new
skill that a lot of us

[01:42 - 01:45]
are learning and trying to get
better at, myself included.

[01:45 - 01:49]
Now my first experience using
GenAI that was transformative

[01:49 - 01:51]
was for a pretty simple task.

[01:51 - 01:54]
I needed to quickly collect
everyone's availability

[01:54 - 01:55]
for an important team meeting.

[01:55 - 01:59]
I asked over chat, and everyone
responded in a different format,

[01:59 - 02:02]
as people are likely to do,
and it was a lot to track.

[02:02 - 02:04]
But with the help
of GenAI, I was

[02:04 - 02:07]
able to organize everyone's
availability into a table

[02:07 - 02:11]
and then transposed it so the
table was sorted by date, not

[02:11 - 02:12]
by chat message.

[02:12 - 02:13]
A task that would
have taken forever

[02:13 - 02:16]
manually only took me a
few minutes with GenAI.

[02:16 - 02:18]
And that was my
breakthrough moment--

[02:18 - 02:21]
using GenAI in my
everyday tasks to turn

[02:21 - 02:24]
things that used to be a
headache into something

[02:24 - 02:25]
simple and easy.

[02:25 - 02:27]
And that's what this
course is about,

[02:27 - 02:31]
using GenAI to help
you get your job done.

[02:31 - 02:34]
So what is prompting anyway?

[02:34 - 02:36]
Put simply, prompting
is the process

[02:36 - 02:40]
of providing specific
instructions to a GenAI tool

[02:40 - 02:42]
to receive new
information or to achieve

[02:42 - 02:45]
a desired outcome on a task.

[02:45 - 02:47]
Those instructions
are called prompts.

[02:47 - 02:50]
When we write a prompt
for a GenAI tool,

[02:50 - 02:51]
we're giving it a
series of inputs

[02:51 - 02:54]
and telling it what we
would like it to generate.

[02:54 - 02:57]
Some GenAI tools can
generate text or images,

[02:57 - 03:01]
while others generate
video, audio, or even code.

[03:01 - 03:04]
A prompting is both
an art and a science.

[03:04 - 03:06]
To get the best
results, we need to be

[03:06 - 03:09]
precise in defining
what we need.

[03:09 - 03:12]
Now this is similar to the way
you would help your teammate get

[03:12 - 03:13]
started on a new project.

[03:13 - 03:16]
Providing context and
setting parameters

[03:16 - 03:19]
will get you the best
output from GenAI.

[03:19 - 03:22]
The first thing you'll learn
is the prompting framework.

[03:22 - 03:24]
It's a formula for
writing great prompts.

[03:24 - 03:27]
You'll use this framework
throughout the course.

[03:27 - 03:29]
And after that, it's
all about putting

[03:29 - 03:31]
prompts to use on
specific tasks that

[03:31 - 03:33]
can save you time in your job.

[03:33 - 03:38]
You'll use GenAI to brainstorm
ideas, develop plans, and draft

[03:38 - 03:40]
emails for different audiences.

[03:40 - 03:43]
We'll teach you how to summarize
meeting notes, assign action

[03:43 - 03:44]
items, and more.

[03:44 - 03:47]
We'll also teach you how to
analyze data and spreadsheets

[03:47 - 03:49]
with GenAI.

[03:49 - 03:50]
You'll write prompts
that can help you

[03:50 - 03:52]
find insights buried in data.

[03:52 - 03:56]
You'll then use GenAI to turn
those insights into visuals,

[03:56 - 03:59]
and eventually turn it
all into a slide deck

[03:59 - 04:01]
with talking points
for a presentation.

[04:01 - 04:04]
Next, you'll learn advanced
prompting techniques

[04:04 - 04:07]
to help you untangle
complex tasks.

[04:07 - 04:09]
For example, you'll
learn how to create

[04:09 - 04:12]
prompts that can help make
long-term, complicated projects

[04:12 - 04:15]
easier to plan and execute.

[04:15 - 04:18]
You'll also learn how to
design a prompt to create

[04:18 - 04:22]
your own personal-sized
AI agent to do things

[04:22 - 04:24]
like practice
before an interview

[04:24 - 04:27]
or prepare for difficult
work conversations.

[04:27 - 04:31]
And finally, you'll learn
how to use GenAI responsibly,

[04:31 - 04:36]
including guidelines for using
it in your job and on your team.

[04:36 - 04:37]
This is crucial.

[04:37 - 04:41]
GenAI tools help you with
the work that you do,

[04:41 - 04:43]
but they don't do it for you.

[04:43 - 04:47]
Anyone using GenAI should always
be evaluating and fact-checking

[04:47 - 04:48]
outputs.

[04:48 - 04:50]
There are a lot of
GenAI tools out there.

[04:50 - 04:51]
And in this course.

[04:51 - 04:53]
We're going to
demonstrate how to prompt

[04:53 - 04:56]
using Gemini and
other Google AI tools

[04:56 - 04:59]
like Gemini for Google
Workspace and Google AI Studio.

[04:59 - 05:01]
But all of the techniques
and best practices

[05:01 - 05:05]
you'll learn in this course can
be applied to other GenAI tools

[05:05 - 05:08]
like ChatGPT,
Copilot, or Claude.

[05:08 - 05:09]
Last thing.

[05:09 - 05:11]
We designed this course
to give you skills

[05:11 - 05:13]
that you can use
at work right away.

[05:13 - 05:16]
So all of these lessons and
techniques you're going to learn

[05:16 - 05:18]
are rooted in
real-world scenarios.

[05:18 - 05:20]
You should experiment
and play around

[05:20 - 05:22]
to figure out what
works best for you.

[05:22 - 05:24]
And as you go
through this course,

[05:24 - 05:27]
feel free to pause the
video and test what you just

[05:27 - 05:30]
learned with something
you're working on right now.

[05:30 - 05:32]
Now let's get started
with our first prompts.

[05:44 - 05:47]
In this lesson, you're going to
learn how to create effective

[05:47 - 05:48]
prompts.

[05:48 - 05:51]
A good prompt follows
a simple framework--

[05:51 - 05:58]
task, context, references,
evaluate, and iterate.

[05:58 - 06:02]
If you ever forget a step, just
remember Thoughtfully Create

[06:02 - 06:06]
Really Excellent Inputs.

[06:06 - 06:08]
First is task.

[06:08 - 06:11]
You need to describe the task
you want the generative AI

[06:11 - 06:12]
tool to help you with.

[06:12 - 06:17]
Now this should include a
persona and a format preference

[06:17 - 06:19]
so that the task is specific.

[06:19 - 06:22]
Persona refers to what
expertise you want

[06:22 - 06:24]
the GenAI tool to draw from.

[06:24 - 06:27]
You can ask the tool
to take on a persona

[06:27 - 06:31]
like a professional speechwriter
or a marketing executive

[06:31 - 06:33]
with 15 years of experience.

[06:33 - 06:35]
Or you can ask it
to create output

[06:35 - 06:40]
for a specific audience, a
customer, or even your manager.

[06:40 - 06:42]
You can be as detailed
as you'd like when

[06:42 - 06:44]
adding a persona to your task.

[06:44 - 06:48]
Format refers to how you
want the output to appear,

[06:48 - 06:52]
whether that's a bulleted list,
short sentences, or a table.

[06:52 - 06:53]
So there you have it.

[06:53 - 06:54]
Task.

[06:54 - 06:57]
Next, you'll include context,
or the necessary details

[06:57 - 06:59]
to help the GenAI
tool understand

[06:59 - 07:01]
what you need from it.

[07:01 - 07:04]
This is the difference between
writing "Give me some ideas

[07:04 - 07:07]
for a birthday
present under $30"

[07:07 - 07:10]
and "Give me five ideas
for a birthday present,

[07:10 - 07:14]
my budget is $30, the gift is
for a 29-year-old who loves

[07:14 - 07:18]
winter sports and has recently
switched from snowboarding

[07:18 - 07:19]
to skiing."

[07:19 - 07:23]
Sometimes you'll add
references for the GenAI tool

[07:23 - 07:26]
to use while
creating its output.

[07:26 - 07:29]
You just asked a GenAI
tool to give you ideas

[07:29 - 07:30]
for a birthday present, right?

[07:30 - 07:33]
Well, if you add
examples of birthday

[07:33 - 07:36]
presents you've given in
the past as references,

[07:36 - 07:39]
the GenAI tool can give
you a more useful output.

[07:39 - 07:42]
There aren't always going to
be clear references of what

[07:42 - 07:44]
you need, especially if
you're working on something

[07:44 - 07:48]
more abstract or searching
for ideas and inspiration.

[07:48 - 07:52]
Once you have your output,
it's time to evaluate.

[07:52 - 07:55]
Ask yourself if the
input you provided

[07:55 - 07:57]
gave you the output you needed.

[07:57 - 08:00]
This leads us to the final part
of the framework-- iterate.

[08:00 - 08:03]
If you evaluate your output
and determine that you're not

[08:03 - 08:05]
getting what you need,
you can try again

[08:05 - 08:09]
by adding more information
or tweaking your prompt.

[08:09 - 08:11]
And this is a key part
of prompting effectively,

[08:11 - 08:14]
and we'll explore it in-depth
later on in the course.

[08:14 - 08:16]
One more note on the framework.

[08:16 - 08:19]
There are plenty of ways to
construct an effective prompt.

[08:19 - 08:21]
The order of how you
construct a prompt

[08:21 - 08:25]
is less important than the
substance of the prompt itself.

[08:25 - 08:27]
As long as you're
thoughtfully creating

[08:27 - 08:31]
really excellent inputs,
your outputs should be great.

[08:42 - 08:46]
Let's put the
framework into action.

[08:46 - 08:49]
First, we'll log into Gemini,
and then use the tool to help us

[08:49 - 08:53]
brainstorm ideas for a new
high-performance sneaker line.

[08:53 - 08:57]
First, let's add the task.

[08:57 - 09:03]
Generate five ideas for a new
high performance sneaker line.

[09:03 - 09:06]
OK, we've asked Gemini
to complete a task,

[09:06 - 09:09]
but we're not really applying
the prompting framework yet.

[09:09 - 09:15]
Remember, Thoughtfully Create
Really Excellent Inputs.

[09:15 - 09:17]
This prompt is all
task and nothing else,

[09:17 - 09:19]
which might give
us an output that's

[09:19 - 09:21]
too broad and not very useful.

[09:21 - 09:24]
Still, Gemini
generated five ideas

[09:24 - 09:26]
with unique names
and descriptions.

[09:26 - 09:29]
This isn't a bad start,
but we can do better.

[09:29 - 09:31]
Let's add some more
details, like our desired

[09:31 - 09:36]
format and a more specific
task for the tool to complete.

[09:36 - 09:46]
List the concepts and materials
for each sneaker in an outline.

[09:46 - 09:47]
That's much better.

[09:47 - 09:51]
Now we have a set of unique
ideas for a sneaker line

[09:51 - 09:54]
that includes the
materials for each shoe,

[09:54 - 09:56]
and it came in our
preferred format.

[09:56 - 09:58]
I think we can do even
better, don't you?

[09:58 - 10:01]
Let's add some context.

[10:01 - 10:07]
The sneakers should be
made for athletes doing

[10:07 - 10:10]
cross-training activities.

[10:10 - 10:14]
With the new information, Gemini
created five new sneaker ideas

[10:14 - 10:17]
that are more suited
to our specific goals.

[10:17 - 10:19]
Remember, getting
tailored outputs

[10:19 - 10:23]
means we need to provide a
GenAI tool with more details

[10:23 - 10:27]
and context in order to
generate more useful results.

[10:27 - 10:31]
Success is all
about the details.

[10:31 - 10:34]
So let's give references a try.

[10:34 - 10:38]
References give GenAI tools
examples to work from,

[10:38 - 10:40]
and that can mean
asking a GenAI tool

[10:40 - 10:45]
to learn from the tone, style,
or length of a given reference.

[10:45 - 10:47]
Providing multiple
references is also

[10:47 - 10:50]
known as few-shot prompting.

[10:50 - 10:52]
Shots are just
references or examples,

[10:52 - 10:54]
and the term is used a lot.

[10:54 - 10:57]
There's also
single-shot prompting,

[10:57 - 10:59]
which means we're
giving it one reference,

[10:59 - 11:03]
and zero-shot prompting, which
means we don't give the AI

[11:03 - 11:05]
tool any references.

[11:05 - 11:09]
Now most of the time, between
two and five references

[11:09 - 11:11]
is the sweet spot
for a GenAI tool.

[11:11 - 11:14]
Too few references and we
don't give enough context.

[11:14 - 11:18]
Too many, we could skew the
results and limit creativity.

[11:18 - 11:21]
To practice few shot prompting
with our new sneaker line,

[11:21 - 11:24]
let's include descriptions
of shoes that already exist.

[11:24 - 11:26]
One of them is from a
budget line of shoes

[11:26 - 11:29]
and the other one has
a new adaptive sole.

[11:29 - 11:34]
We can input those
descriptions like this.

[11:34 - 11:40]
Keep the five ideas generated,
but refine them using these two

[11:40 - 11:43]
examples as references.

[11:43 - 11:45]
Here's what we'll paste
in the references.

[11:50 - 11:53]
There's a lot of choices
here, and they all

[11:53 - 11:55]
seem like good
options for the task.

[11:55 - 11:56]
And this is cool.

[11:56 - 11:59]
A shoe that regulates
temperature.

[11:59 - 12:01]
Evaluating the
output and iterating

[12:01 - 12:04]
might be the last part of
our prompting framework,

[12:04 - 12:07]
but they're also where we get
to experiment and get creative.

[12:07 - 12:09]
Each new output
is an opportunity

[12:09 - 12:11]
to further refine
your prompt until you

[12:11 - 12:13]
get the response you want.

[12:13 - 12:18]
In fact, we've been evaluating
and iterating this whole time.

[12:18 - 12:20]
We evaluated the sneaker
ideas from our first prompt,

[12:20 - 12:23]
and we iterated
by adding context.

[12:23 - 12:25]
We evaluated the
output again and we

[12:25 - 12:27]
iterated by adding references.

[12:27 - 12:31]
And remember, we can always
add details or tweak phrasing

[12:31 - 12:33]
in order to change our outputs.

[12:33 - 12:37]
We like to say ABI, or
Always Be Iterating.

[12:37 - 12:40]
Give the prompting
framework a try yourself.

[12:40 - 12:44]
Remember, it's always better to
start simple and then slowly add

[12:44 - 12:46]
complexity, iterating as you go.

[12:46 - 12:49]
If your outputs start
to lose quality,

[12:49 - 12:52]
you might need to go back and
make your prompts simpler,

[12:52 - 12:53]
and that's OK.

[12:53 - 12:55]
Learning what works
and what doesn't is

[12:55 - 12:56]
all part of the journey.

[12:56 - 13:00]
If you ever get stuck, just
remember to Thoughtfully Create

[13:00 - 13:05]
Really Excellent inputs, and
you'll get back on track.

[13:17 - 13:19]
There are going to be times
when your prompt simply

[13:19 - 13:22]
isn't giving you what
you want, but instead

[13:22 - 13:25]
of scrapping all your work
and starting again from zero,

[13:25 - 13:29]
think about how you can always
be iterating, or ABI, to try

[13:29 - 13:32]
and mold the outputs into
something more useful.

[13:32 - 13:36]
By the end of this video, you'll
learn four helpful iteration

[13:36 - 13:37]
methods.

[13:37 - 13:40]
The first method is to revisit
the prompting framework,

[13:40 - 13:44]
and make sure you're providing
enough specificity in your task,

[13:44 - 13:46]
context, and references.

[13:46 - 13:50]
For example, if you wrote
"Give me five blog post ideas,"

[13:50 - 13:53]
a generative AI tool might
respond better if you adjusted

[13:53 - 13:57]
your prompt to include
the persona and format.

[13:57 - 14:01]
For example, you are an
expert on sports nutrition.

[14:01 - 14:03]
Provide five blog
post headlines that

[14:03 - 14:05]
summarize the biggest
trends happening

[14:05 - 14:09]
in the industry for an
audience of physical therapists

[14:09 - 14:12]
working with professional
basketball players.

[14:12 - 14:14]
The second method is
to separate your prompt

[14:14 - 14:16]
into shorter sentences.

[14:16 - 14:19]
Start by taking a long
input and breaking it down

[14:19 - 14:21]
into smaller tasks.

[14:21 - 14:22]
This is the long input.

[14:22 - 14:26]
Summarize the key data points
and information in this report,

[14:26 - 14:28]
then create visual
graphs from the data,

[14:28 - 14:31]
and shorten the key
information into bullets.

[14:31 - 14:33]
You can break this up
into shorter sentences

[14:33 - 14:36]
and input them as
separate prompts.

[14:36 - 14:38]
You'll input each prompt,
receive an output,

[14:38 - 14:42]
and then follow up with a new
prompt until all of your tasks

[14:42 - 14:43]
have been submitted.

[14:43 - 14:47]
First, summarize the key
data points and information

[14:47 - 14:49]
in this report.

[14:49 - 14:53]
Then follow that up with create
visual graphs with the data

[14:53 - 14:54]
you summarized.

[14:54 - 14:57]
And finally, shorten
the key information

[14:57 - 14:59]
you summarized into bullets.

[14:59 - 15:03]
Sometimes shorter sentences
can yield more precise results

[15:03 - 15:07]
because the GenAI tool can parse
one small task at a time instead

[15:07 - 15:11]
of identifying the relationships
between all of them at once.

[15:11 - 15:13]
You can also try using
different phrasing

[15:13 - 15:16]
or switching to an
analogous task, which

[15:16 - 15:19]
is a task that is very
similar to the one you're

[15:19 - 15:21]
trying to complete,
but different enough

[15:21 - 15:24]
to trigger a new response.

[15:24 - 15:27]
For example, if you're
asking a GenAI tool

[15:27 - 15:30]
to help write a marketing
plan for a product or service,

[15:30 - 15:32]
you could instead
ask it to write

[15:32 - 15:35]
a story about how
this product fits

[15:35 - 15:38]
into the lives of our
target customer demographic.

[15:38 - 15:41]
By moving from "write
a marketing plan"

[15:41 - 15:45]
to "write a story," you're
asking the Gen AI tool

[15:45 - 15:47]
to approach the
task differently,

[15:47 - 15:50]
which might lead you
closer to a useful output.

[15:50 - 15:53]
Finally, introducing
constraints might also

[15:53 - 15:55]
help focus a GenAI
tool's outputs.

[15:55 - 15:58]
Maybe you want to make a
playlist for an upcoming road

[15:58 - 16:00]
trip and you're trying to
figure out what artists you

[16:00 - 16:01]
want to include.

[16:01 - 16:04]
You've added some context
about your favorite genre,

[16:04 - 16:06]
but the results
are kind of boring.

[16:06 - 16:09]
You've heard all these songs
a million times before.

[16:09 - 16:12]
To get better output and
something more unexpected,

[16:12 - 16:15]
you could start
adding constraints,

[16:15 - 16:18]
like specifying you only want
artists from a certain region,

[16:18 - 16:22]
or artists that have released
music in the last five years.

[16:22 - 16:24]
Adding constraints
to your prompt

[16:24 - 16:27]
will help the GenAI tool
narrow down its outputs

[16:27 - 16:30]
and give you something
more helpful or unique.

[16:30 - 16:33]
The better you can
evaluate and iterate,

[16:33 - 16:35]
the better your output will be.

[16:47 - 16:50]
Images and visuals can
be as important as words

[16:50 - 16:53]
when you want to
communicate ideas.

[16:53 - 16:55]
In this lesson, I'm
going to teach you

[16:55 - 16:59]
how to use generative AI
tools to create visuals.

[16:59 - 17:03]
So far, we've asked GenAI tools
to produce responses in what's

[17:03 - 17:07]
called a text-based modality.

[17:07 - 17:09]
Modalities are the
different formats

[17:09 - 17:13]
in which GenAI tools receive
or produce information,

[17:13 - 17:18]
whether that's text, images,
video, audio, or code.

[17:18 - 17:21]
Different GenAI tools
are better at working

[17:21 - 17:23]
in certain modalities.

[17:23 - 17:25]
Be sure to check the
GenAI tool you're

[17:25 - 17:28]
using to find out
which modalities it's

[17:28 - 17:30]
capable of using or producing.

[17:30 - 17:32]
Let's start with
image generation.

[17:32 - 17:35]
Some GenAI tools
can create images--

[17:35 - 17:39]
a sunrise, a bouquet of flowers,
or even a crab riding a dolphin.

[17:39 - 17:42]
But those same tools
can also make images

[17:42 - 17:46]
for a business or a
professional presentation.

[17:46 - 17:49]
Maybe you're a musician
playing a gig in New Orleans

[17:49 - 17:52]
and you want to
promote your concert,

[17:52 - 17:55]
so you use a GenAI tool to
help you create a poster

[17:55 - 17:57]
to advertise the show.

[17:57 - 18:01]
Let's prompt Gemini to create
both text and images so we

[18:01 - 18:03]
can discuss the subtle
differences between prompting

[18:03 - 18:05]
for each modality.

[18:05 - 18:07]
We'll start with the text first.

[18:07 - 18:11]
Remember to keep the
Thoughtfully Create Really

[18:11 - 18:14]
Excellent Inputs
framework in mind.

[18:14 - 18:18]
Text-based prompts work best
when we specify our task

[18:18 - 18:20]
and add some clear context.

[18:20 - 18:26]
So we could prompt "Generate
headlines for a poster promoting

[18:26 - 18:30]
a rock concert in New Orleans."

[18:30 - 18:34]
And to add a little more context
about the task, we could write,

[18:34 - 18:39]
"The concert is one night
only, and the headlines should

[18:39 - 18:44]
encourage the audience
not to miss out."

[18:44 - 18:47]
By specifying our task
and adding context,

[18:47 - 18:53]
we're guiding the GenAI tool to
the text-based output we want.

[18:53 - 18:57]
And just like that, Gemini came
up with a few catchy headlines

[18:57 - 18:59]
for the poster.

[18:59 - 19:01]
And this is a good
one right here.

[19:01 - 19:02]
NOLA.

[19:02 - 19:06]
This is it, unforgettable
rock, one night only.

[19:06 - 19:09]
It's catchy and it
gets to the point.

[19:09 - 19:12]
Now in order to prompt the
GenAI tool for an image,

[19:12 - 19:14]
we'll need to
tweak our language.

[19:14 - 19:16]
We'll still use the
prompting framework,

[19:16 - 19:19]
but we'll need to provide
more vivid descriptions that

[19:19 - 19:22]
help the GenAI tool determine
the type of image it

[19:22 - 19:24]
needs to create.

[19:24 - 19:26]
This means specifying
the size, color,

[19:26 - 19:31]
and position of things in the
image and the overall aesthetic

[19:31 - 19:32]
we want.

[19:32 - 19:36]
first, we'll specify
our task and format.

[19:36 - 19:42]
"Generate an image of an
electric guitar for a poster.

[19:42 - 19:47]
It should be a
photographic style."

[19:47 - 19:50]
And how about some
vivid descriptions?

[19:50 - 19:55]
"And the guitar should
be glittery or sparkly,

[19:55 - 19:59]
and create a sense
of excitement.

[19:59 - 20:04]
The guitar should be in the
foreground and give a sense that

[20:04 - 20:06]
it's floating in the sky."

[20:09 - 20:10]
Great.

[20:10 - 20:12]
Gemini created four
different images

[20:12 - 20:15]
that you can use on your poster.

[20:15 - 20:18]
So how can we make these
images even better?

[20:18 - 20:22]
Let's break down how to iterate
and refine a prompt for images.

[20:22 - 20:24]
We're still going to use
the prompting framework,

[20:24 - 20:25]
but with a few little tweaks.

[20:25 - 20:28]
For the concert
poster, maybe you

[20:28 - 20:29]
liked the appearance
of the guitar,

[20:29 - 20:33]
but you want to make it even
more exciting by adding a storm

[20:33 - 20:36]
with lightning
striking the guitar.

[20:36 - 20:43]
We could refine it by writing,
"Now make the sky stormy with

[20:43 - 20:44]
lightning hitting the guitar."

[20:47 - 20:48]
There we go.

[20:48 - 20:52]
You could keep this image or
keep evaluating and iterating

[20:52 - 20:56]
again and again, adding relevant
details from each new output

[20:56 - 20:58]
until you get one that works.

[21:11 - 21:14]
OK, we just used text
to create an image,

[21:14 - 21:17]
but we can also use
an image as part

[21:17 - 21:20]
of our prompt to create a
different type of output.

[21:20 - 21:23]
Let me introduce you to
multimodal prompting.

[21:23 - 21:25]
The essence of
multimodal prompting

[21:25 - 21:27]
is using different
types of media

[21:27 - 21:31]
to prompt a generative AI
tool like inputting image

[21:31 - 21:34]
and text or audio and text.

[21:34 - 21:38]
This can be especially
useful in the workplace.

[21:38 - 21:39]
You can take a
picture of a chart

[21:39 - 21:44]
and ask a GenAI tool to explain
the data in plain language.

[21:44 - 21:47]
You could upload different
logo options for your company's

[21:47 - 21:50]
rebrand as a set of
references and then

[21:50 - 21:53]
prompt the GenAI tool to
give you more choices based

[21:53 - 21:54]
on each direction.

[21:54 - 21:57]
Or you could capture
audio of another language

[21:57 - 22:01]
and ask for a transcription in
the language you understand.

[22:01 - 22:04]
Here's an example where we'll
prompt with both image and text

[22:04 - 22:07]
to receive a text-based
output from Gemini.

[22:07 - 22:09]
Let's imagine you're
an entrepreneur who

[22:09 - 22:13]
needs help creating social
media captions for a new design

[22:13 - 22:15]
of nail art you're selling.

[22:15 - 22:17]
You can take a picture
of your nail art

[22:17 - 22:19]
and ask for help
writing a caption.

[22:19 - 22:23]
Here's a photo of the nail art,
and we'll input this into Gemini

[22:23 - 22:30]
and prompt, "Write a social
media post featuring this image.

[22:30 - 22:35]
The post should be fun,
short, and focus on the fact

[22:35 - 22:40]
it's a collection of new
designs I'm selling."

[22:40 - 22:43]
Note that in addition
to including a reference

[22:43 - 22:46]
photo of the nail art, we
still used the other elements

[22:46 - 22:48]
of our prompting framework.

[22:48 - 22:52]
We specified our task,
added some context,

[22:52 - 22:54]
and included the format.

[22:54 - 22:59]
Besides the image itself, we
didn't provide other references,

[22:59 - 23:03]
but if we have a specific tone
or voice we want the GenAI

[23:03 - 23:07]
tool to match, we could
always input a few captions

[23:07 - 23:10]
from previous
posts to reference.

[23:13 - 23:14]
This is great.

[23:14 - 23:18]
Gemini analyzed the image
and created a fun captio

[23:18 - 23:20]
you can use to
market the nail art.

[23:20 - 23:23]
Notice how it uses emojis
to break up the text,

[23:23 - 23:26]
and how it engages followers
by asking a question

[23:26 - 23:28]
about their favorite design.

[23:28 - 23:30]
The cool thing about
multimodal prompting

[23:30 - 23:33]
is that it reflects the way
you experience the world.

[23:33 - 23:37]
You don't just discuss the
words or images in a work

[23:37 - 23:40]
presentation, you build
connections between them

[23:40 - 23:44]
to get a fuller understanding
of the topic in question.

[23:44 - 23:47]
A mix of text, images,
and other modalities

[23:47 - 23:51]
can open up new ways of solving
problems or saving time.

[23:51 - 23:54]
You could use a GenAI tool to
turn a picture of a city map

[23:54 - 23:57]
into a list of
notable landmarks,

[23:57 - 24:00]
find key insights
within an audio file,

[24:00 - 24:05]
or quickly extract a list
of room names from an office

[24:05 - 24:06]
floorplan.

[24:06 - 24:07]
Here's another example.

[24:07 - 24:10]
You go to a conference and
receive a schedule of events

[24:10 - 24:13]
and you want your team to
focus on a few of the events

[24:13 - 24:15]
in particular.

[24:15 - 24:21]
"I want to send a reminder to my
colleagues about certain events

[24:21 - 24:23]
from a conference schedule.

[24:23 - 24:29]
Extract the times of the
keynote speaker and two panel

[24:29 - 24:34]
discussions from this
schedule into a table."

[24:34 - 24:38]
Again, we specified our task,
provided helpful context,

[24:38 - 24:40]
and included the
format before inputting

[24:40 - 24:42]
the picture of the schedule.

[24:42 - 24:42]
Let's check it out.

[24:46 - 24:47]
Great.

[24:47 - 24:50]
The table makes it
really easy to see where

[24:50 - 24:52]
your team needs to go and when.

[24:52 - 24:54]
You can even take
it a step further

[24:54 - 24:57]
and prompt Gemini to draft
an email about these events.

[24:57 - 24:59]
We'll get into prompting
for email drafts

[24:59 - 25:00]
later in the course.

[25:00 - 25:03]
Just remember to keep the
prompting framework in mind

[25:03 - 25:06]
no matter what modality
you are prompting in

[25:06 - 25:08]
to achieve the best results.

[25:08 - 25:10]
How might you leverage different
modalities in your prompts

[25:10 - 25:11]
to help you at work?

[25:21 - 25:25]
Generative AI tools are
powerful, but like any tool,

[25:25 - 25:28]
it's important you use them
responsibly, especially at work.

[25:28 - 25:30]
First, consider
the problem you're

[25:30 - 25:32]
using GenAI to help you solve.

[25:32 - 25:35]
Does it align with your
goals and your obligations

[25:35 - 25:37]
to your clients and coworkers?

[25:37 - 25:40]
What about your organization's
policies and local laws

[25:40 - 25:44]
about using GenAI to
perform this type of task?

[25:44 - 25:47]
If it doesn't align, then you
should rethink your process

[25:47 - 25:50]
and whether or not a GenAI
tool is right for the job.

[25:50 - 25:53]
Second, consult your
company's rules or policies

[25:53 - 25:57]
before entering confidential or
sensitive data into GenAI tools.

[25:57 - 26:00]
You can also check if your
company has an enterprise

[26:00 - 26:04]
version of GenAI tool that
is OK for other types of use.

[26:04 - 26:08]
And remember, if you're using
GenAI tools for personal use,

[26:08 - 26:11]
avoid entering personal or
confidential information

[26:11 - 26:14]
about yourself into
publicly-available tools

[26:14 - 26:19]
and always check how the
data you enter might be used.

[26:19 - 26:21]
Finally, being a
responsible GenAI user

[26:21 - 26:25]
means evaluating outputs for
potential bias and errors

[26:25 - 26:28]
and disclosing any
use of GenAI when

[26:28 - 26:30]
sharing content with others.

[26:30 - 26:33]
While it's OK to enlist
the help of GenAI,

[26:33 - 26:37]
you'll still need to evaluate
the outputs for accuracy the way

[26:37 - 26:39]
you would for any output.

[26:39 - 26:41]
The same goes for
hallucinations,

[26:41 - 26:43]
which is when a
GenAI tool provides

[26:43 - 26:48]
outputs that are inconsistent,
incorrect, or even nonsensical.

[26:48 - 26:52]
Hallucinations most often happen
when someone gives a GenAI tool

[26:52 - 26:55]
vague or unclear
instructions, or when

[26:55 - 26:58]
a tool guesses at an
answer to something

[26:58 - 27:00]
it didn't quite understand.

[27:00 - 27:03]
Hallucinations can
be hard to recognize.

[27:03 - 27:06]
That's why it's so crucial to
fact-check and cross-reference

[27:06 - 27:11]
outputs to confirm if a fact or
statement in an output is true.

[27:11 - 27:13]
Remember, GenAI
tools aren't thinking

[27:13 - 27:16]
critically the way humans can.

[27:16 - 27:19]
It's important to keep what
we call a human-in-the-loop

[27:19 - 27:24]
approach, meaning a human should
verify GenAI outputs before

[27:24 - 27:25]
using them.

[27:25 - 27:28]
I recently generated an
image for a presentation.

[27:28 - 27:33]
I wanted to have a bunch of cats
on a rocket going to the moon.

[27:33 - 27:36]
Now instead, the output
was a little bit off.

[27:36 - 27:40]
The cats were on top of the
rocket rather than inside it,

[27:40 - 27:43]
and that's not exactly
safe for cats, is it?

[27:43 - 27:46]
While I did write in my
prompt that cats needed

[27:46 - 27:49]
to be on a rocket, I didn't mean
that literally, but the tool

[27:49 - 27:53]
didn't know that, so I
iterated and specified

[27:53 - 27:57]
that the cats should appear
safe and sound inside the rocket

[27:57 - 27:58]
instead of on top of it.

[27:58 - 28:02]
Some GenAI tools such as Gemini
have a built in fact-checker

[28:02 - 28:04]
that allows you to
cross-reference the outputs

[28:04 - 28:06]
using Google Search.

[28:06 - 28:09]
Comparing outputs side
by side makes it easier

[28:09 - 28:13]
to determine how accurate
your initial output is

[28:13 - 28:16]
and to find any discrepancies.

[28:16 - 28:17]
So how can you
avoid these issues

[28:17 - 28:20]
before they become a problem?

[28:20 - 28:22]
Try to recognize
biases and outputs

[28:22 - 28:24]
and the negative
consequences they can have.

[28:24 - 28:28]
They may appear as stereotypes
or unfair representations

[28:28 - 28:30]
of a group of people.

[28:30 - 28:32]
Avoiding biased and
negative outputs

[28:32 - 28:35]
starts with inputting
specific detailed prompts

[28:35 - 28:37]
and iterating as needed.

[28:37 - 28:39]
Another key part
of this is using

[28:39 - 28:43]
language that includes people
of all backgrounds, genders,

[28:43 - 28:47]
and ethnicities and avoid
stereotypes and generalizations

[28:47 - 28:48]
in your inputs.

[28:48 - 28:52]
For example, if you were using
a GenAI tool to help you write

[28:52 - 28:54]
the description
for a job posting,

[28:54 - 28:57]
you should avoid the gendered
terms like "serviceman"

[28:57 - 28:59]
or "workman."

[28:59 - 29:02]
Instead, use
"serviceperson" or "worker"

[29:02 - 29:06]
so the tool doesn't write a
description that only speaks

[29:06 - 29:08]
to someone who
identifies as male.

[29:08 - 29:10]
Remember, GenAI
tools are only tools.

[29:10 - 29:13]
They don't think critically
and can't understand

[29:13 - 29:15]
nuance the way humans can.

[29:15 - 29:18]
It's your job to bring that
human perspective every time

[29:18 - 29:19]
you use a GenAI tool.

[29:27 - 29:30]
AMINA: I have to read a lot
of research papers for my job.

[29:30 - 29:34]
Sometimes I get several
sent to me in a single day.

[29:34 - 29:37]
And even though I love hearing
about everything new happening

[29:37 - 29:39]
in my field, there
are times when

[29:39 - 29:42]
I can't get through every
line of every paper.

[29:42 - 29:44]
When that happens, I'll
upload one of these papers

[29:44 - 29:48]
to a generative AI tool
and start a conversation.

[29:48 - 29:50]
I'll prompt for the most
important points in the research

[29:50 - 29:53]
and then ask follow-up
questions on information

[29:53 - 29:55]
that I'm curious about.

[29:55 - 29:57]
It's helped me get familiar
with a lot of topics

[29:57 - 30:01]
quickly because it's like having
a creative on-demand assistant

[30:01 - 30:03]
that I can have a
conversation with.

[30:03 - 30:05]
In this module, you're going
to learn about the best

[30:05 - 30:09]
ways to prompt GenAI tools
to help you summarize text,

[30:09 - 30:12]
write better emails, level
up your brainstorming,

[30:12 - 30:15]
build schedules
effortlessly, and take

[30:15 - 30:17]
meeting notes instantly.

[30:17 - 30:20]
Now let's learn more about what
you can do with those prompts

[30:20 - 30:23]
and how they can benefit you at
work to boost your productivity

[30:23 - 30:25]
and spark your creativity.

[30:35 - 30:38]
CLARA: Hi, I'm Clara, and
I'm a product marketing

[30:38 - 30:40]
manager on the Gemini team.

[30:40 - 30:41]
And I'm one of your instructors.

[30:41 - 30:44]
Before I joined Google,
I was a startup founder,

[30:44 - 30:45]
and as any founder
can tell you, one

[30:45 - 30:48]
of the most important
and challenging parts

[30:48 - 30:51]
of running a startup is getting
in touch with investors.

[30:51 - 30:53]
I sent out a lot of
emails, and sometimes, I

[30:53 - 30:54]
wouldn't get a response.

[30:54 - 30:58]
I spent a lot of time coming up
with creative follow-up emails

[30:58 - 30:59]
in order to get their attention.

[30:59 - 31:02]
Generative AI is really
good at that sort of thing.

[31:02 - 31:06]
GenAI tools can help you
draft emails, adjust your tone

[31:06 - 31:08]
or style of writing,
and give you ideas

[31:08 - 31:10]
on how to change your approach.

[31:10 - 31:11]
Here's how we can put
that to work for you.

[31:14 - 31:16]
Let's try this example.

[31:16 - 31:19]
Using our prompt framework,
we'll add the task,

[31:19 - 31:22]
provide context, then
evaluate and iterate.

[31:22 - 31:24]
This is a useful
exercise whether you're

[31:24 - 31:27]
a copywriter working
on an ad campaign,

[31:27 - 31:30]
a speechwriter drafting talking
points for an executive,

[31:30 - 31:33]
or gym manager communicating
a schedule change.

[31:33 - 31:35]
Let's start with the persona.

[31:35 - 31:38]
"I'm a gym manager."

[31:38 - 31:40]
Next, we'll add in the context.

[31:40 - 31:44]
"And we have a
new gym schedule."

[31:44 - 31:46]
And specify the task.

[31:46 - 31:51]
"Write an email informing our
staff of the new schedule.

[31:51 - 31:57]
Highlight the fact that the
Monday-Wednesday-Friday Cardio

[31:57 - 32:01]
Blast class changed from
7:00 AM to 6:00 AM."

[32:01 - 32:04]
And let's add even
more specificity,

[32:04 - 32:06]
especially about the content
and format of the email, which

[32:06 - 32:08]
could include language or tone.

[32:08 - 32:14]
"Make the email professional
and friendly and short so that

[32:14 - 32:17]
the readers can
skim it quickly."

[32:17 - 32:20]
And now, let's just paste
in the new gym schedule.

[32:20 - 32:22]
"Here's the new schedule."

[32:26 - 32:29]
OK, this is a really great
email to send to the staff.

[32:29 - 32:32]
All the information is there
about the schedule changes

[32:32 - 32:34]
and it's short and easy to read.

[32:34 - 32:35]
But did you know
you can ask Gemini

[32:35 - 32:39]
to adjust this same
output for a new audience?

[32:39 - 32:41]
This would be useful if, for
example, you wanted your output

[32:41 - 32:45]
to be more casual for a small,
intimate team, more formal

[32:45 - 32:48]
for the executives of the
team, or even for a completely

[32:48 - 32:50]
different audience.

[32:50 - 32:51]
Let's try it.

[32:51 - 32:53]
We're going to
iterate on our prompt

[32:53 - 32:57]
asking Gemini to write an email
to the gym members in a more

[32:57 - 32:58]
casual tone.

[32:58 - 33:00]
We're asking for
a new version here

[33:00 - 33:03]
with new specifics and context.

[33:03 - 33:07]
"Now write a concise
consumer-facing email with

[33:07 - 33:12]
the same information for our
gym members and clients."

[33:12 - 33:14]
Let's get even more specific.

[33:14 - 33:19]
"Explain that this new schedule
will help us better serve them."

[33:19 - 33:22]
And now, let's make sure
we're clarifying the new tone.

[33:22 - 33:26]
"Make the tone fun,
friendly, and motivating

[33:26 - 33:29]
to reflect the gym's
energy and enthusiasm

[33:29 - 33:32]
for our members' health goals.

[33:32 - 33:34]
Include a pun about
lifting weights."

[33:39 - 33:40]
That's more like it.

[33:40 - 33:43]
What a fun email, and it still
has all the same information

[33:43 - 33:44]
about the schedule changes.

[33:44 - 33:47]
With just one extra
prompt, we completely

[33:47 - 33:48]
altered this email
for a new audience

[33:48 - 33:51]
without losing the
important information.

[33:51 - 33:53]
Can you think of a time
when you were having trouble

[33:53 - 33:55]
figuring out how to get
the tone right in something

[33:55 - 33:56]
you've written?

[33:56 - 33:59]
With some iterations to
your task and context,

[33:59 - 34:01]
you can tweak your writing
to land your message how

[34:01 - 34:02]
you want it.

[34:02 - 34:05]
Whenever you're drafting
any sort of communications

[34:05 - 34:07]
with the help of
a GenAI tool, make

[34:07 - 34:10]
sure the outputs are factual,
and adjust your prompts

[34:10 - 34:11]
so that you receive
the information that's

[34:11 - 34:12]
most helpful to you.

[34:25 - 34:27]
Whenever we hire someone
new to join my team,

[34:27 - 34:29]
we have a meeting
to welcome them.

[34:29 - 34:32]
What I've started doing
is prompting generative AI

[34:32 - 34:34]
for suggestions
on fun icebreakers

[34:34 - 34:37]
that are engaging
even over video call.

[34:37 - 34:39]
I can even generate
personalized icebreakers

[34:39 - 34:43]
by including fun facts about
my new teammate in the prompt.

[34:43 - 34:45]
Whether you're leading a
team bonding experience

[34:45 - 34:48]
or thinking of ideas
for a work project,

[34:48 - 34:50]
you can use GenAI to
generate ideas and brainstorm

[34:50 - 34:54]
solutions to help you make
more informed decisions.

[34:54 - 34:57]
Remember, Thoughtfully Create
Really Excellent Inputs.

[34:57 - 35:00]
You need to add
your task, context,

[35:00 - 35:02]
and include relevant references.

[35:02 - 35:04]
Then you need to
evaluate and iterate.

[35:04 - 35:06]
In this lesson, you'll
learn how to write

[35:06 - 35:09]
prompts to generate
ideas with Gemini.

[35:09 - 35:10]
Consider this.

[35:10 - 35:13]
You need to plan a launch
for a new video game.

[35:13 - 35:15]
Gemini can help you
with everything,

[35:15 - 35:18]
from brainstorming sales
strategies to managing

[35:18 - 35:19]
the launch timeline.

[35:19 - 35:23]
We'll start with the persona
and include the context as well.

[35:23 - 35:27]
"I'm a marketer for a
well-known video game

[35:27 - 35:32]
producer known for creating
immersive story-based online

[35:32 - 35:33]
video games.

[35:33 - 35:37]
I'm planning the launch of a new
medieval fantasy role playing

[35:37 - 35:42]
game that follows the path of
a young protagonist searching

[35:42 - 35:44]
for their missing partner.

[35:44 - 35:47]
The game's primary
audience is young adults.

[35:47 - 35:51]
The game is reaching the
end stages of development,

[35:51 - 35:55]
and I need help creating a
timeline before it goes live."

[35:55 - 35:59]
Then we'll specify the tasks
and include the formats.

[35:59 - 36:02]
"Provide a rough timeline
for the year leading up

[36:02 - 36:03]
to its launch.

[36:03 - 36:07]
Also, provide some pre-launch
ideas to help generate buzz

[36:07 - 36:08]
around the game."

[36:08 - 36:10]
Before we check
the output, I want

[36:10 - 36:13]
to highlight a few important
things about this prompt.

[36:13 - 36:15]
We've set up the
persona, your company

[36:15 - 36:18]
launches video games; and the
context, a medieval fantasy role

[36:18 - 36:20]
playing game launch.

[36:20 - 36:22]
We've also specified the task--

[36:22 - 36:25]
create a timeline for the launch
and provide pre-launch ideas

[36:25 - 36:26]
to generate buzz.

[36:26 - 36:28]
With all that in mind,
let's review the output.

[36:32 - 36:33]
This is a great start.

[36:33 - 36:36]
Sign me up for the contest.

[36:36 - 36:38]
While these are cool
pre-launch ideas,

[36:38 - 36:40]
they could use a
little more detail.

[36:40 - 36:42]
Maybe your team is hoping
to promote this game

[36:42 - 36:43]
around the world.

[36:43 - 36:45]
Let's give Gemini
more context and ask

[36:45 - 36:48]
it to update the launch events
with a global audience in mind.

[36:48 - 36:50]
Since we're already in
conversation with Gemini,

[36:50 - 36:53]
we'll follow up on the prompt
we just wrote by adding,

[36:53 - 36:58]
"Now provide pre-launch ideas
that will appeal to a global

[36:58 - 37:03]
audience of young adults."

[37:03 - 37:04]
There we go.

[37:04 - 37:06]
These ideas are suited
for a global audience,

[37:06 - 37:08]
and not to mention,
seem really fun.

[37:08 - 37:10]
I love the idea to include
cultural references

[37:10 - 37:14]
in the game to relate to
players from around the world.

[37:14 - 37:16]
Evaluating and iterating is
like having a conversation

[37:16 - 37:19]
with a GenAI tool,
continually guiding it

[37:19 - 37:21]
to generate our desired output.

[37:21 - 37:23]
We can all use a little
help generating new ideas.

[37:23 - 37:26]
How can I help you with
brainstorming at work?

[37:37 - 37:38]
OK.

[37:38 - 37:41]
Spreadsheets aren't my
favorite thing in the world.

[37:41 - 37:43]
I'm a creative
marketer, so I try

[37:43 - 37:46]
to avoid cells and formulas
as much as possible,

[37:46 - 37:48]
but there are
times when I really

[37:48 - 37:51]
need to use spreadsheets to
create tables or track a project

[37:51 - 37:52]
timeline.

[37:52 - 37:55]
So, I've started to use
generative AI to help me,

[37:55 - 37:58]
and it's made creating those
tables much easier and less

[37:58 - 37:59]
time-consuming.

[37:59 - 38:03]
No matter where you work, being
able to easily turn information

[38:03 - 38:06]
into an organized plan
can be a massive help.

[38:06 - 38:09]
Think of a schedule
or a project tracker.

[38:09 - 38:12]
These documents are so
important because they

[38:12 - 38:15]
keep team members aware of
their roles and responsibilities

[38:15 - 38:18]
and keep timelines and
deliverables on track,

[38:18 - 38:20]
but building them
can be a chore.

[38:20 - 38:24]
Let's explore how GenAI can help
you speed that process along.

[38:24 - 38:26]
Let's try this example.

[38:26 - 38:29]
You need to create a schedule
to plan your employee

[38:29 - 38:33]
staffing each week and want to
prompt Gemini to create a table.

[38:33 - 38:36]
Here's our task,
format, and context.

[38:36 - 38:39]
"I have 10 employees,
their employee numbers

[38:39 - 38:41]
are 1 through 10.

[38:41 - 38:45]
Create a table that
tracks weekly staffing.

[38:45 - 38:51]
Create columns for day name and
shift, morning or afternoon."

[38:51 - 38:52]
We also added constraints.

[38:52 - 38:56]
"There should always be
two employees scheduled

[38:56 - 39:00]
for the morning shift and
two employees scheduled

[39:00 - 39:01]
for the afternoon shift.

[39:01 - 39:03]
Employees should
not be scheduled

[39:03 - 39:05]
for a morning shift
on the following day

[39:05 - 39:07]
after they were scheduled
for an afternoon shift.

[39:07 - 39:09]
Employees should
not be scheduled

[39:09 - 39:11]
for both the morning
and afternoon shifts

[39:11 - 39:13]
on the same day.

[39:13 - 39:17]
Every employee should have
roughly the same number of total

[39:17 - 39:19]
shifts per week."

[39:19 - 39:22]
In just a few seconds, Gemini
created a staffing schedule

[39:22 - 39:24]
in a format that's
easy to track.

[39:24 - 39:26]
The output includes
the constraints

[39:26 - 39:28]
we added when
prompting, like making

[39:28 - 39:30]
sure no one has to
work a double shift.

[39:30 - 39:33]
Even better, we can export
the schedule to Google Sheets

[39:33 - 39:35]
to continue working on it.

[39:35 - 39:38]
After logging in, we can
prompt Gemini in Sheets

[39:38 - 39:41]
to summarize our schedule,
create a new schedule,

[39:41 - 39:44]
or even create formulas to
quickly analyze the information.

[39:44 - 39:48]
But, remember to avoid entering
any sensitive information

[39:48 - 39:51]
that you wouldn't want a tool
reviewer to have access to.

[39:51 - 39:53]
In this case, we
wouldn't want to enter

[39:53 - 39:55]
any specific information
about employees.

[39:55 - 39:58]
That's why we use
anonymous employee numbers.

[39:58 - 40:01]
Always consult your
organization's policies

[40:01 - 40:03]
regarding sensitive
data and GenAI

[40:03 - 40:05]
use before leveraging
a Gemini tool for work.

[40:18 - 40:21]
My team and I work in Google
Docs on a daily basis.

[40:21 - 40:23]
Sometimes when I'm
editing, I'll realize

[40:23 - 40:25]
the writing could be
improved, but I'm not sure

[40:25 - 40:27]
how to approach it.

[40:27 - 40:29]
Instead of staring
blankly at my screen,

[40:29 - 40:31]
I can prompt Gemini
in Docs to pull out

[40:31 - 40:33]
what I need to
suggest something new.

[40:33 - 40:36]
To do that, start by
logging into Docs.

[40:36 - 40:38]
You'll need a Google
account for this.

[40:38 - 40:39]
Let's try an example.

[40:39 - 40:42]
You receive customer feedback
that your company's return

[40:42 - 40:45]
policy is too long
and confusing.

[40:45 - 40:49]
You can paste the return policy
into a doc, then prompt Gemini.

[40:49 - 40:52]
From there, you can enter
the following prompt.

[40:52 - 40:55]
Let's specify the
task and context.

[40:55 - 41:01]
"Summarize this content to write
a clear and concise product

[41:01 - 41:07]
return policy and outline five
steps for customers to take

[41:07 - 41:08]
in sequential order."

[41:13 - 41:15]
Now, you have a
solid return policy

[41:15 - 41:17]
to reference when assisting
customers, as well

[41:17 - 41:20]
as a list of ways customers
can begin their returns.

[41:20 - 41:23]
There's even more can do to
save time and boost productivity

[41:23 - 41:25]
with Gemini in Docs.

[41:25 - 41:28]
Some days are just so packed
with meetings and people

[41:28 - 41:30]
and action items
in those meetings

[41:30 - 41:33]
that it can be hard to
keep track of who said what

[41:33 - 41:34]
or what you're responsible for.

[41:34 - 41:37]
Think about a long
meeting you had recently

[41:37 - 41:39]
and just how much
there was to cover.

[41:39 - 41:41]
You might want a
transcript, right?

[41:41 - 41:43]
You can create one
right in Google Meet.

[41:43 - 41:46]
From there, you can
turn to Gemini in Docs

[41:46 - 41:47]
to help you keep
things organized

[41:47 - 41:50]
by creating meeting
minutes, outlines,

[41:50 - 41:52]
a bulleted list, and more.

[41:52 - 41:54]
To illustrate how
it works, we'll

[41:54 - 41:57]
use a transcript generated
by GenAI and open up Docs.

[41:57 - 42:01]
Now, let's prompt Gemini, making
sure to ask for exactly what you

[42:01 - 42:05]
need using our prompt framework,
Thoughtfully Create Really

[42:05 - 42:07]
Excellent Inputs.

[42:07 - 42:11]
First, we'll add the task,
"Create meeting minutes for this

[42:11 - 42:12]
meeting."

[42:12 - 42:15]
Then specify the format.

[42:15 - 42:19]
"Section the meeting
minutes by speaker

[42:19 - 42:24]
and create a bulleted summary of
key points made by that speaker.

[42:24 - 42:28]
If applicable, highlight
action items for each speaker."

[42:31 - 42:33]
The meeting notes
might be more useful

[42:33 - 42:35]
if formatted in a
clearer way with more

[42:35 - 42:37]
defined roles and
responsibilities

[42:37 - 42:38]
from the meeting.

[42:38 - 42:41]
Let's iterate on our
prompt to achieve that.

[42:41 - 42:44]
We'll use the same task.

[42:44 - 42:47]
"Create meeting minutes
for this meeting,"

[42:47 - 42:50]
but we'll change the format
and get more specific with what

[42:50 - 42:53]
exactly it is we
want from the output.

[42:53 - 42:56]
"Create sections
based on key points

[42:56 - 42:58]
extracted from the minutes.

[42:58 - 43:01]
Attribute each key
point to a speaker,

[43:01 - 43:06]
and then assign action items
to the speaker who is most

[43:06 - 43:07]
appropriate to complete them."

[43:12 - 43:13]
Much better.

[43:13 - 43:15]
The action items are
clearly displayed,

[43:15 - 43:18]
and you have the most important
takeaways from each attendee.

[43:18 - 43:21]
Now you can use these notes
to align with your colleagues

[43:21 - 43:25]
on a project, share updates
to keep stakeholders informed,

[43:25 - 43:27]
help your teammates complete
their responsibilities,

[43:27 - 43:30]
and monitor the progress
of deliverables.

[43:41 - 43:43]
When you're doing
research, writing a report,

[43:43 - 43:46]
or investigating
market trends, you're

[43:46 - 43:48]
bound to come across some
especially complex or lengthy

[43:48 - 43:49]
materials.

[43:49 - 43:51]
Luckily, a generative
AI tool can

[43:51 - 43:55]
summarize long blocks of
text, extract key insights,

[43:55 - 43:58]
and even transform them
into new resources.

[43:58 - 44:01]
You can also specify your
preferred format in your prompt

[44:01 - 44:04]
so you get exactly the
type of output you want.

[44:04 - 44:05]
What's a report
you've been meaning

[44:05 - 44:07]
to read but you haven't
had the time to?

[44:07 - 44:10]
You want to summarize it
and pull out key insights,

[44:10 - 44:12]
but since the report
is so long, you'll

[44:12 - 44:16]
have to use GenAI tool
with a long context window.

[44:16 - 44:19]
A long context window
allows for the processing

[44:19 - 44:22]
of a large amount of information
in different formats at once.

[44:22 - 44:26]
The long context window also
enhances the GenAI model's

[44:26 - 44:29]
ability to understand
and generate

[44:29 - 44:31]
more coherent and
contextually relevant

[44:31 - 44:33]
responses to our prompts.

[44:33 - 44:36]
We'll test this in
Google AI Studio.

[44:36 - 44:40]
Let's open up AI Studio and
sign in with a Google account.

[44:40 - 44:43]
Notice how we can give
our prompt a name.

[44:43 - 44:46]
This can make it easier
to find our prompts later,

[44:46 - 44:49]
and it can be useful when
sharing prompts with others.

[44:49 - 44:52]
Now, let's start using
the prompting framework.

[44:52 - 44:56]
Here's the task,
including the format.

[44:56 - 45:02]
"Summarize this report in an
outline focused only on the most

[45:02 - 45:03]
essential points."

[45:06 - 45:07]
Pretty cool, huh?

[45:07 - 45:10]
44 pages of information
distilled down

[45:10 - 45:11]
into a few points.

[45:11 - 45:14]
Let's call this
prompt Report Summary.

[45:14 - 45:18]
Long context windows aren't
available on every tool,

[45:18 - 45:21]
so, depending on the
GenAI tool you use,

[45:21 - 45:24]
it may not be able to
analyze long documents.

[45:24 - 45:27]
GenAI technology is dynamic
and ever-changing, so

[45:27 - 45:30]
always double-check what
features and capabilities

[45:30 - 45:32]
are available in the
tools you're using.

[45:32 - 45:34]
And here's a pro
tip in the meantime.

[45:34 - 45:36]
If you're using
a GenAI tool that

[45:36 - 45:40]
can handle a large piece of
text and you need a summary,

[45:40 - 45:43]
break the text up and paste
chunks of it in at a time.

[45:43 - 45:46]
Prompt to summarize
each chunk, and then

[45:46 - 45:48]
ask to summarize the summaries.

[45:48 - 45:51]
Whether you're doing research
or analyzing reports,

[45:51 - 45:53]
getting a summary of
what you're reading

[45:53 - 45:55]
can help you
understand the material

[45:55 - 45:57]
in a shorter amount of time.

[45:57 - 46:00]
Another pro tip for you,
not only can GenAI tools

[46:00 - 46:03]
summarize lengthy
documents, but they can also

[46:03 - 46:08]
explain them to you in different
ways by incorporating a persona.

[46:08 - 46:10]
Specifying who the
audience is, you

[46:10 - 46:13]
can personalize the summary
for different people.

[46:13 - 46:14]
For example, you
can ask things like,

[46:14 - 46:18]
"Summarize this for someone
who isn't great with numbers,"

[46:18 - 46:22]
or, "Summarize this for a
small business owner," or even,

[46:22 - 46:24]
"Summarize this using
'80s movie quotes."

[46:36 - 46:39]
Now that a few summarizing
techniques, let's

[46:39 - 46:41]
discuss some more
advanced methods

[46:41 - 46:44]
you can use to condense
information with GenAI tools.

[46:44 - 46:47]
When you ask GenAI tool
to provide a summary,

[46:47 - 46:50]
sometimes the initial
output is way too broad.

[46:50 - 46:54]
You need a bit more detail to
make it truly useful to you.

[46:54 - 46:57]
A technique called
chain-of-density prompting

[46:57 - 46:58]
can help with that.

[46:58 - 47:01]
With this method, you get
increasingly concise summaries

[47:01 - 47:04]
and end up with a chain
of refined outputs.

[47:04 - 47:05]
Think of it this way.

[47:05 - 47:08]
You're working on the perfect
elevator pitch for your company.

[47:08 - 47:12]
Your first draft is way too long
and includes too many details,

[47:12 - 47:15]
but as you refine it, it
gets shorter and more direct,

[47:15 - 47:18]
all without losing the important
points you need to get across.

[47:18 - 47:21]
Eventually, you land on
the perfect elevator pitch.

[47:21 - 47:24]
Quick, direct, and effective.

[47:24 - 47:26]
Iterating on our
last prompt, we want

[47:26 - 47:29]
to update the task and format.

[47:29 - 47:36]
"Provide a shorter summary
focusing on the report's top two

[47:36 - 47:37]
to three trends."

[47:39 - 47:43]
Mission accomplished, but
maybe you want it even shorter.

[47:43 - 47:45]
We can get more
specific with our prompt

[47:45 - 47:49]
to ensure the output not only
provides a simpler summary,

[47:49 - 47:51]
but is also really
targeted to your needs.

[47:51 - 47:52]
Let's go shorter.

[47:52 - 47:55]
We'll ask for a single sentence.

[47:55 - 48:00]
"Condense the summary
into a single sentence."

[48:00 - 48:02]
And even more specific context.

[48:02 - 48:06]
"Highlighting the
most dominant trend."

[48:06 - 48:07]
Nice.

[48:07 - 48:09]
We kept asking it
to refine further,

[48:09 - 48:12]
and we were direct and specific
about the desired output.

[48:12 - 48:14]
We can repeat this
process until we

[48:14 - 48:18]
generate the most useful and
helpful outputs for the task.

[48:18 - 48:21]
We can even get ahead of
these extra iteration steps

[48:21 - 48:24]
and ask that the
GenAI tool provides

[48:24 - 48:26]
multiple increasingly
short iterations

[48:26 - 48:28]
in the initial prompt.

[48:28 - 48:30]
You might be wondering why we
wouldn't get to the shortest

[48:30 - 48:32]
output right away.

[48:32 - 48:35]
Well, iteration helps us
check for hallucinations

[48:35 - 48:38]
as we go from something super
detailed to an output that's

[48:38 - 48:40]
more direct and to the point.

[48:40 - 48:43]
It also helps us stay
informed about what

[48:43 - 48:46]
information is being taken out
as the outputs get shorter.

[48:46 - 48:50]
Chain-of-density prompting also
works in the other direction.

[48:50 - 48:53]
If the output is too
short, we can also

[48:53 - 48:56]
prompt to increase the
length and add more detail.

[48:56 - 48:58]
Remember when I asked you
to think of a report you

[48:58 - 49:00]
haven't found the time to read?

[49:00 - 49:02]
Give these prompting
techniques a try

[49:02 - 49:05]
and discover how quickly you
can generate a helpful summary.

[49:13 - 49:14]
AMINA: Remember
that time your team

[49:14 - 49:18]
launched a new product and sales
went up in a specific region?

[49:18 - 49:22]
Or when a simple survey revealed
an untapped customer need?

[49:22 - 49:24]
Those weren't just
numbers on a spreadsheet.

[49:24 - 49:27]
They were stories that
led to valuable insights

[49:27 - 49:29]
when organized and analyzed.

[49:29 - 49:30]
The problem?

[49:30 - 49:34]
You may not always have the time
to track those stories down.

[49:34 - 49:39]
Generative AI tools can help
you manage, analyze, visualize,

[49:39 - 49:41]
and present data.

[49:41 - 49:43]
In this module,
you'll first learn

[49:43 - 49:46]
how to prompt GenAI tools to
uncover insights from data.

[49:46 - 49:51]
Then, you'll bring that data
to life with visualizations.

[49:51 - 49:54]
And finally, you'll explore
how to put it all together

[49:54 - 49:57]
into a compelling presentation
that helps you show and tell

[49:57 - 49:58]
your story.

[50:11 - 50:12]
TIMOTHY: Data can
teach you a lot,

[50:12 - 50:15]
but you need to know how
to interpret it first.

[50:15 - 50:19]
Let's use the prompting
framework, Thoughtfully Create

[50:19 - 50:23]
Really Excellent Inputs, to
unlock insights and patterns

[50:23 - 50:26]
from data using a GenAI tool.

[50:26 - 50:29]
Before we get started,
remember that not all GenAI

[50:29 - 50:30]
tools work with data.

[50:30 - 50:34]
Be sure to check what your
tool can do before using it.

[50:34 - 50:36]
We'll teach you how to do
this by prompting Gemini

[50:36 - 50:39]
models in Google AI Studio.

[50:39 - 50:40]
One other note.

[50:40 - 50:43]
As you work with
these tools, remember

[50:43 - 50:46]
some of the ground rules
about using GenAI responsibly.

[50:46 - 50:48]
Always review your
organization's policies

[50:48 - 50:51]
before including sensitive
or confidential data

[50:51 - 50:52]
in your prompt.

[50:52 - 50:55]
For this example, we're
using publicly-available data

[50:55 - 50:57]
found on Kaggle.

[50:57 - 50:58]
Are you ready to try?

[50:58 - 51:00]
Let's do it.

[51:00 - 51:04]
Here, we have a data set with
information about a grocery

[51:04 - 51:04]
chain.

[51:04 - 51:08]
AI Studio can help us
analyze all that data to find

[51:08 - 51:11]
trends and patterns
that could help inform

[51:11 - 51:12]
how the company operates.

[51:12 - 51:14]
But there are a lot
of variables here,

[51:14 - 51:17]
so it'll be helpful to organize
the data to make it easier

[51:17 - 51:19]
to work with.

[51:19 - 51:22]
First, we'll ask for
step-by-step help.

[51:22 - 51:25]
We can upload the data directly
from our Google Drive where

[51:25 - 51:27]
the Google Sheet is stored.

[51:27 - 51:29]
If we were using
Microsoft Excel,

[51:29 - 51:31]
we'd upload it
from our computer.

[51:31 - 51:33]
Once we've uploaded
the spreadsheet,

[51:33 - 51:34]
we're ready to write the prompt.

[51:34 - 51:40]
"Attached is a Google
Sheet of store data."

[51:40 - 51:42]
Now that we've
shared some context,

[51:42 - 51:46]
we'll add the specific task.

[51:46 - 51:52]
"How can I create a new column
in Sheets that calculates

[51:52 - 51:59]
the average sales per
customer for each store?"

[51:59 - 52:02]
Let's review the output.

[52:02 - 52:04]
The model provided some
helpful suggestions

[52:04 - 52:07]
for calculating the
average sales per customer

[52:07 - 52:08]
for each store.

[52:08 - 52:11]
It even explained how to use
a more descriptive formula

[52:11 - 52:14]
to label our new column
in the spreadsheet.

[52:14 - 52:16]
And that's just one example.

[52:16 - 52:18]
If that method of
organization doesn't work,

[52:18 - 52:22]
we can iterate on our prompt
to get an output that's

[52:22 - 52:24]
closer to what we need.

[52:24 - 52:25]
Let's take this further.

[52:25 - 52:27]
Discovering trends
in a data set can

[52:27 - 52:30]
help us make informed
decisions, and we

[52:30 - 52:34]
can prompt a GenAI tool
to help find those trends.

[52:34 - 52:36]
Can you think of a
spreadsheet that you've

[52:36 - 52:37]
been meaning to analyze?

[52:37 - 52:41]
Keep that in mind as we
go through this example.

[52:41 - 52:44]
Start again with the task.

[52:44 - 52:50]
"Give me insights into the
relationship between daily

[52:50 - 52:58]
customer count items available
and sales based on the given

[52:58 - 52:59]
data."

[52:59 - 53:02]
That prompt got us a lot
of interesting information,

[53:02 - 53:03]
and fast.

[53:03 - 53:05]
And this is fascinating.

[53:05 - 53:06]
There seems to be
no clear correlation

[53:06 - 53:10]
between the number of items in a
given store and its total sales

[53:10 - 53:11]
volume.

[53:11 - 53:14]
Some small stores are even
outpacing the big ones.

[53:14 - 53:16]
The output even gives us
some potential reasons

[53:16 - 53:20]
behind this trend so we can
investigate further and think

[53:20 - 53:22]
about potential
sales strategies.

[53:22 - 53:24]
This is great.

[53:24 - 53:27]
Now back to that spreadsheet
we've been meaning to analyze.

[53:27 - 53:32]
How can GenAI help us save time
and extract meaningful insights?

[53:32 - 53:35]
With the help of GenAI
tools, we no longer

[53:35 - 53:37]
have to spend hours
crunching data,

[53:37 - 53:40]
we can do it with
just a few prompts.

[53:49 - 53:52]
I'm a spreadsheet
nerd, but I also

[53:52 - 53:56]
know that not everyone shares my
passion for cells and formulas.

[53:56 - 53:59]
Dense spreadsheets and complex
formulas can be intimidating,

[53:59 - 54:00]
but fear not.

[54:00 - 54:02]
Generative AI can help
you understand and write

[54:02 - 54:04]
spreadsheet formulas.

[54:04 - 54:06]
Just prompt it using
natural language.

[54:06 - 54:09]
You already know
how to prompt a tool

[54:09 - 54:12]
to help you create and
understand text, images,

[54:12 - 54:16]
and data points, but it can
also help you better understand

[54:16 - 54:17]
spreadsheet formulas.

[54:17 - 54:20]
Let's put the
framework into action.

[54:20 - 54:24]
Imagine your coworker at a
restaurant went on vacation

[54:24 - 54:27]
and gave you a spreadsheet
full of data and formulas.

[54:27 - 54:29]
Some of them seem
familiar, but there

[54:29 - 54:32]
are others that are a
little more complicated.

[54:32 - 54:34]
You need to order
inventory today,

[54:34 - 54:36]
but you don't want to
bother your colleague,

[54:36 - 54:38]
so you turn to Gemini
for some guidance.

[54:38 - 54:42]
We'll start off with the
persona and some background.

[54:42 - 54:49]
"I work at a large restaurant
and I need to order inventory

[54:49 - 54:53]
while my coworker is on leave."

[54:53 - 54:55]
Then add in some context.

[54:55 - 55:01]
"They left me with a formula
to calculate how much food

[55:01 - 55:05]
to order, but I
don't understand it."

[55:05 - 55:07]
Here's where we'll
paste in the formula.

[55:10 - 55:14]
And let's give Gemini the
task and desired format.

[55:14 - 55:23]
"Explain what the formula means
in simple, step-by-step terms."

[55:23 - 55:26]
That's much easier
to understand.

[55:26 - 55:28]
You now hopefully
have a clearer sense

[55:28 - 55:30]
of what the formula is
trying to accomplish

[55:30 - 55:33]
so that you can get that
stock order handled quickly.

[55:33 - 55:35]
Now that you understand
the formulas,

[55:35 - 55:38]
you can figure out what
to do if you get stuck.

[55:38 - 55:40]
Let's try another one.

[55:40 - 55:44]
Have you ever received an error
message in your spreadsheet

[55:44 - 55:45]
and not known what to do?

[55:45 - 55:48]
Let's prompt Gemini to learn
how you can figure out where

[55:48 - 55:52]
those errors are coming from.

[55:52 - 55:58]
"The Google Sheet I have uses
this formula to calculate

[55:58 - 55:59]
orders."

[55:59 - 56:02]
I'll paste in the formula.

[56:02 - 56:09]
"However, I received an error
message in one of the cells."

[56:09 - 56:13]
Time to specify the task
and what format we want.

[56:13 - 56:21]
"Give me a step-by-step process
for finding the error and fixing

[56:21 - 56:23]
it in Google Sheets."

[56:27 - 56:30]
And there you have it, clear
instructions for resolving

[56:30 - 56:31]
that pesky error message.

[56:31 - 56:34]
With those out of the way, you
can get that inventory order

[56:34 - 56:34]
moving.

[56:46 - 56:47]
Does your job involve.

[56:47 - 56:49]
Presenting information
to different people?

[56:49 - 56:52]
Maybe you need to pitch
new potential clients

[56:52 - 56:55]
or relay information
to your colleagues

[56:55 - 56:57]
or your organization's
leadership.

[56:57 - 56:59]
When it comes to
presenting data,

[56:59 - 57:01]
you want to show
rather than tell.

[57:01 - 57:03]
Thankfully, generative
AI tools are

[57:03 - 57:06]
really good at helping you
determine the best ways

[57:06 - 57:07]
to visualize data.

[57:07 - 57:09]
You just need to
know what to ask for.

[57:09 - 57:12]
You can prompt a GenAI
tool to get advice

[57:12 - 57:15]
on the best types of charts and
graphs to illustrate your data.

[57:15 - 57:19]
The prompting framework
should still be your guide.

[57:19 - 57:23]
Add your task, context,
and references, if needed,

[57:23 - 57:26]
evaluate the
output, and iterate.

[57:26 - 57:29]
The clearer you are about
the kind of chart you want

[57:29 - 57:35]
and what the parameters are, the
more useful your output will be.

[57:35 - 57:39]
Consider this, you and I are
co-owners of a bookstore.

[57:39 - 57:41]
Here, we have a list
of best-selling books

[57:41 - 57:44]
and how many copies have
been sold around the world

[57:44 - 57:46]
since they've been published.

[57:46 - 57:49]
Before we choose to stock
some of those titles,

[57:49 - 57:51]
let's examine the data.

[57:51 - 57:54]
Remember, not all GenAI
tools can analyze data.

[57:54 - 57:57]
Be sure to check what your
tool can do before using it.

[57:57 - 58:01]
For this example, we'll
use Google AI Studio.

[58:01 - 58:04]
First, let's think through how
to represent this data visually

[58:04 - 58:06]
with a chart.

[58:06 - 58:08]
If you don't know what
type of chart to use,

[58:08 - 58:11]
you can always prompt a
GenAI tool for suggestions.

[58:11 - 58:14]
We'll prompt the model
using plain language

[58:14 - 58:18]
to describe a data set in order
to find out what kind of chart

[58:18 - 58:19]
might work best.

[58:19 - 58:21]
Describe the data set here.

[58:21 - 58:23]
This is our context.

[58:23 - 58:27]
"My data set is a
spreadsheet that

[58:27 - 58:31]
uses the following columns--

[58:31 - 58:40]
Title, Published,
Genre, First Published,

[58:40 - 58:47]
and Approximate
Sales in Millions."

[58:47 - 58:49]
Now let's request the
format to be a chart.

[58:49 - 58:51]
So we have some choices.

[58:51 - 58:56]
"Give me options for a chart
that shows the correlation

[58:56 - 59:00]
between Genre and Sales."

[59:00 - 59:03]
Let's be even more
specific so that we

[59:03 - 59:06]
know what kind of correlation
the chart will actually

[59:06 - 59:07]
be displaying.

[59:07 - 59:14]
"Explain how genre and sales
are correlated according

[59:14 - 59:18]
to the information."

[59:18 - 59:20]
Interesting.

[59:20 - 59:24]
Now we have three great ideas
for creating charts that will

[59:24 - 59:26]
visualize the data clearly.

[59:26 - 59:30]
Even better, we have detailed
explanations about each chart,

[59:30 - 59:33]
giving us the option to
choose which visualization

[59:33 - 59:36]
works best for our data set.

[59:36 - 59:39]
You're not always going
to know what type of chart

[59:39 - 59:42]
you want to use, which is
where adding a reference

[59:42 - 59:43]
to your prompt can be helpful.

[59:43 - 59:46]
You can use charts that are
similar to what you want

[59:46 - 59:50]
or charts you found
helpful and include those

[59:50 - 59:52]
as a reference in your prompt.

[59:52 - 59:55]
Then ask for
recommendations on how

[59:55 - 59:59]
to create a similar
chart using your data.

[59:59 - 01:00:01]
We'll find a chart to
reference and prompt

[01:00:01 - 01:00:03]
the model to emulate
it using data

[01:00:03 - 01:00:05]
from our bookstore scenario.

[01:00:05 - 01:00:07]
Start by uploading
the sample chart

[01:00:07 - 01:00:10]
and then prompt the model
to get some information

[01:00:10 - 01:00:12]
about what it's depicting.

[01:00:12 - 01:00:15]
Remember, it's sometimes
better to start simple and then

[01:00:15 - 01:00:17]
gradually add complexity.

[01:00:21 - 01:00:24]
"Describe this chart.

[01:00:24 - 01:00:30]
What kind of data relationships
are highlighted in the chart?"

[01:00:30 - 01:00:33]
We're asking for a
description of the chart

[01:00:33 - 01:00:36]
before we prompt to
recreate it just so that we

[01:00:36 - 01:00:39]
can take it step by step.

[01:00:39 - 01:00:39]
OK.

[01:00:39 - 01:00:42]
We have some good
Intel about the chart.

[01:00:42 - 01:00:46]
The model is telling us it's
called a stacked bar chart,

[01:00:46 - 01:00:48]
and that it represents
the staffing

[01:00:48 - 01:00:51]
breakdown across different
departments in an organization.

[01:00:51 - 01:00:53]
And it analyzed the
data, telling us

[01:00:53 - 01:00:56]
how the Finance Department
has a high proportion

[01:00:56 - 01:00:59]
of full-time staff while the
Product Department has a more

[01:00:59 - 01:01:00]
even mix.

[01:01:00 - 01:01:05]
Now, we'll enter a prompt
about the data we already have

[01:01:05 - 01:01:09]
and ask for recommendations on
visualizing it in the same way

[01:01:09 - 01:01:11]
as the chart we referenced.

[01:01:11 - 01:01:15]
You guessed it, let's
add some context.

[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]
"My data set is a
spreadsheet that

[01:01:19 - 01:01:22]
uses the following columns--

[01:01:22 - 01:01:29]
Title, Published,
Genre, First Published,

[01:01:29 - 01:01:35]
and Approximate
Sales in Millions.

[01:01:35 - 01:01:40]
I'm interested in showing the
relationship between Genre

[01:01:40 - 01:01:41]
and Sales."

[01:01:41 - 01:01:43]
And the task.

[01:01:43 - 01:01:49]
"Suggest modifications to make
this chart work better with

[01:01:49 - 01:01:54]
my specific data
using Google Sheets."

[01:01:54 - 01:01:55]
Amazing.

[01:01:55 - 01:01:58]
Now we have instructions
about how to create

[01:01:58 - 01:02:00]
a new chart with our data.

[01:02:00 - 01:02:03]
The output even explains
how to modify a bar

[01:02:03 - 01:02:06]
to illustrate the relationship
between Genre and Sales

[01:02:06 - 01:02:08]
more clearly.

[01:02:08 - 01:02:11]
And remember, if your output
doesn't match what you need,

[01:02:11 - 01:02:15]
you can always tweak
your prompt and iterate.

[01:02:28 - 01:02:31]
Communication goes way
beyond sharing information

[01:02:31 - 01:02:32]
with someone.

[01:02:32 - 01:02:34]
You need to tell a story.

[01:02:34 - 01:02:38]
Stories are how you
make information stick

[01:02:38 - 01:02:39]
in people's minds.

[01:02:39 - 01:02:44]
Generative AI tools can help
organize your presentations

[01:02:44 - 01:02:47]
into compelling stories,
build talking points,

[01:02:47 - 01:02:51]
and even create images to
keep your audience engaged.

[01:02:51 - 01:02:54]
We'll use Gemini to
bring it all together.

[01:02:54 - 01:02:58]
In this scenario, you work for
a company that designs, makes,

[01:02:58 - 01:03:00]
and sells headphones.

[01:03:00 - 01:03:04]
You're preparing to pitch your
team on some cool new features.

[01:03:04 - 01:03:07]
There's a lot of information
and insights to convey,

[01:03:07 - 01:03:09]
so you'll need to
distill what you learned

[01:03:09 - 01:03:11]
into a clear presentation.

[01:03:11 - 01:03:14]
First, let's prompt
Gemini to help figure

[01:03:14 - 01:03:16]
out how to structure
the presentation

[01:03:16 - 01:03:17]
and summarize the findings.

[01:03:20 - 01:03:23]
Let's add in the persona.

[01:03:23 - 01:03:29]
"I'm a product designer
at a headphones brand."

[01:03:29 - 01:03:31]
Here's where we'll
paste in the context.

[01:03:34 - 01:03:36]
Now here's the task.

[01:03:36 - 01:03:40]
"How should I structure
my presentation?"

[01:03:40 - 01:03:42]
And don't forget to
specify the format.

[01:03:42 - 01:03:50]
"List each slide's topic with
its key points and visuals."

[01:03:50 - 01:03:51]
Yeah nice.

[01:03:51 - 01:03:55]
Gemini has suggested a structure
for your presentation that

[01:03:55 - 01:03:58]
includes key points and
visuals for each slide,

[01:03:58 - 01:04:01]
including a title slide, an
intro that sets the stage,

[01:04:01 - 01:04:04]
and details on the three
features that the audience

[01:04:04 - 01:04:06]
is interested in.

[01:04:06 - 01:04:08]
Gemini even suggested
a call to action

[01:04:08 - 01:04:10]
at the end of the presentation.

[01:04:10 - 01:04:11]
It's good advice.

[01:04:11 - 01:04:13]
There are a few
other things that you

[01:04:13 - 01:04:15]
can do to make it more
engaging, like adding

[01:04:15 - 01:04:18]
visuals that complement the
information on the slides.

[01:04:18 - 01:04:21]
When using GenAI for
image generation,

[01:04:21 - 01:04:24]
you want to use the
prompting framework

[01:04:24 - 01:04:26]
with a few additional
things added in.

[01:04:26 - 01:04:29]
You want your input prompt
to be as vivid and detailed

[01:04:29 - 01:04:33]
as possible to help the GenAI
tool determine the type of image

[01:04:33 - 01:04:35]
you want to create.

[01:04:35 - 01:04:37]
This means specifying
the size, color,

[01:04:37 - 01:04:42]
and position of things in the
image and the overall aesthetic

[01:04:42 - 01:04:43]
we want.

[01:04:43 - 01:04:47]
So first, we'll specify
our task and format.

[01:04:47 - 01:04:48]
Start with the task.

[01:04:48 - 01:04:55]
"Generate close-up images
of a pair of sleek silver

[01:04:55 - 01:04:58]
headphones--" and add
in some more context--

[01:04:58 - 01:05:02]
"on a desk in a
college dorm room.

[01:05:02 - 01:05:07]
They should have musical notes
floating around the headphones

[01:05:07 - 01:05:12]
to show that they're
playing music."

[01:05:12 - 01:05:13]
Yeah.

[01:05:13 - 01:05:14]
So cool.

[01:05:14 - 01:05:17]
Gemini created several
images to choose from.

[01:05:17 - 01:05:20]
You can even choose between
photography, vector art,

[01:05:20 - 01:05:24]
sketches, or watercolors
for the style.

[01:05:24 - 01:05:26]
You still want to evaluate
the output just like you

[01:05:26 - 01:05:28]
would when generating text.

[01:05:28 - 01:05:31]
Check your images to make sure
you're getting what you want

[01:05:31 - 01:05:34]
and that there aren't any
mistakes like a headphone cord

[01:05:34 - 01:05:36]
that's not plugged in or
anything else that seems off.

[01:05:36 - 01:05:40]
And remember, part of being
a responsible GenAI user

[01:05:40 - 01:05:45]
is disclosing when you've used
these tools, so add a disclaimer

[01:05:45 - 01:05:48]
whenever you're including an
AI-generated image in your work.

[01:06:01 - 01:06:03]
You've now created
your presentation,

[01:06:03 - 01:06:05]
but there's still one
thing left to do--

[01:06:05 - 01:06:06]
present your work.

[01:06:06 - 01:06:09]
But you don't want to
just read off your slides.

[01:06:09 - 01:06:12]
You want to give your audience
helpful context and commentary

[01:06:12 - 01:06:14]
as you go through them.

[01:06:14 - 01:06:15]
You could go through
your whole deck

[01:06:15 - 01:06:17]
and draft up some
talking points yourself,

[01:06:17 - 01:06:20]
but starting from scratch
will take a lot of time.

[01:06:20 - 01:06:22]
Instead, you can
prompt a generative AI

[01:06:22 - 01:06:25]
tool to give you a head start
and generate speaker notes

[01:06:25 - 01:06:26]
for you.

[01:06:26 - 01:06:30]
For this example, we need
a long context window.

[01:06:30 - 01:06:32]
Remember, long
context windows aren't

[01:06:32 - 01:06:34]
available on every AI tool.

[01:06:34 - 01:06:37]
Different tools have
different capacities.

[01:06:37 - 01:06:41]
For this example, we'll
switch to Google AI Studio.

[01:06:41 - 01:06:45]
Let's upload our
slide with the prompt.

[01:06:45 - 01:06:48]
First, we'll add the
persona and context.

[01:06:48 - 01:06:54]
"I'm a product designer
at a headphones brand."

[01:06:54 - 01:06:58]
Here's where we'll
paste in the context.

[01:06:58 - 01:07:00]
Then we'll give some
more direction on tone

[01:07:00 - 01:07:02]
and specify the format.

[01:07:02 - 01:07:08]
"Provide multiple options
of concise, personable,

[01:07:08 - 01:07:15]
and engaging speaker notes I
can use while presenting this

[01:07:15 - 01:07:15]
slide."

[01:07:21 - 01:07:22]
OK.

[01:07:22 - 01:07:24]
You got some great ideas.

[01:07:24 - 01:07:27]
The suggested speaker notes
have some personality and energy

[01:07:27 - 01:07:29]
which will help keep
your audience engaged,

[01:07:29 - 01:07:32]
but you can get more specific.

[01:07:32 - 01:07:35]
You learn that your
company's marketing director

[01:07:35 - 01:07:37]
will attend the presentation.

[01:07:37 - 01:07:39]
You can prompt the model
to adjust the speaker notes

[01:07:39 - 01:07:41]
for a more senior audience.

[01:07:41 - 01:07:44]
Let's give it a try,
although this time, we'll

[01:07:44 - 01:07:46]
use voice-to-prompt
just to save time.

[01:07:46 - 01:07:50]
"Provide alternate speaker
notes for this slide

[01:07:50 - 01:07:53]
that are specifically directed
toward my headphone company's

[01:07:53 - 01:07:55]
marketing director.

[01:07:55 - 01:07:58]
The director values precision,
and their priorities

[01:07:58 - 01:08:02]
for the organization are to
stay on top of industry trends

[01:08:02 - 01:08:07]
and foster a strong community
of loyal customers."

[01:08:10 - 01:08:12]
And just like that, you
have new speaker notes

[01:08:12 - 01:08:15]
that are more appropriate
for a marketing director.

[01:08:15 - 01:08:16]
Now one last thing.

[01:08:16 - 01:08:19]
You have the presentation
and the speaker notes,

[01:08:19 - 01:08:22]
but you want to fit in some
practice before the big day.

[01:08:22 - 01:08:24]
You can upload a
recording of yourself

[01:08:24 - 01:08:27]
to get specialized feedback.

[01:08:27 - 01:08:29]
Let's start off by
specifying the tone

[01:08:29 - 01:08:32]
and what we want to accomplish.

[01:08:32 - 01:08:39]
"I'm giving a presentation to
my manager pitching new product

[01:08:39 - 01:08:47]
features and I want to sound
authoritative and confident."

[01:08:47 - 01:08:50]
Then we'll explain what you're
going to do and the task.

[01:08:50 - 01:08:54]
"I'm going to read my
presentation aloud.

[01:08:54 - 01:09:00]
Afterward, give me feedback on
whether I've accomplished this

[01:09:00 - 01:09:00]
goal."

[01:09:04 - 01:09:05]
This was really helpful.

[01:09:05 - 01:09:07]
You got a list of
things to remember

[01:09:07 - 01:09:10]
to deliver a great
presentation, but you also

[01:09:10 - 01:09:14]
got specific examples of where
you can work on pacing and tone.

[01:09:14 - 01:09:17]
Since you're using a GenAI
tool with a long context

[01:09:17 - 01:09:20]
window or large memory,
you can save your prompt

[01:09:20 - 01:09:22]
and come back to
where you left off.

[01:09:22 - 01:09:26]
You can continue practicing
without starting all over again.

[01:09:33 - 01:09:36]
AMINA: So I'm a researcher,
which means that sometimes, I

[01:09:36 - 01:09:39]
have to deal with these
hefty grant proposals that

[01:09:39 - 01:09:41]
match my area of expertise.

[01:09:41 - 01:09:44]
And not only that, I have
to go out and find grants

[01:09:44 - 01:09:46]
that I can apply for,
which is, in and of itself,

[01:09:46 - 01:09:47]
its own headache.

[01:09:47 - 01:09:50]
Something I've been doing
is uploading my profile

[01:09:50 - 01:09:52]
as a researcher to
a generative AI tool

[01:09:52 - 01:09:55]
and using it to find
potential grants.

[01:09:55 - 01:09:58]
I'll add my resume, my
published work, my CV,

[01:09:58 - 01:10:00]
and then use different
prompt techniques to search

[01:10:00 - 01:10:03]
for grant programs that
match my background.

[01:10:03 - 01:10:06]
It's especially helpful
because so many places

[01:10:06 - 01:10:08]
have specific rules and
requirements about who

[01:10:08 - 01:10:10]
they're giving grants to.

[01:10:10 - 01:10:13]
Using generative AI has taken
a lot of the guesswork out

[01:10:13 - 01:10:14]
of that process for me.

[01:10:14 - 01:10:18]
In this module, you'll learn how
to prompt Gen AI tools for more

[01:10:18 - 01:10:19]
complex projects.

[01:10:19 - 01:10:23]
You can turn abstract ideas
into step-by-step solutions.

[01:10:23 - 01:10:26]
We'll explore how to
converse with a GenAI tool,

[01:10:26 - 01:10:31]
create an AI agent, and build a
prompt library to help you save

[01:10:31 - 01:10:33]
time and reuse your prompts.

[01:10:33 - 01:10:34]
Let's get started.

[01:10:47 - 01:10:49]
CLARA: Have you ever tried to
put together a jigsaw puzzle?

[01:10:49 - 01:10:51]
You don't just dump
all the pieces out

[01:10:51 - 01:10:53]
and hope for the best, right?

[01:10:53 - 01:10:54]
You start with a game plan.

[01:10:54 - 01:10:56]
Maybe you find the
corner pieces and slowly

[01:10:56 - 01:10:59]
build the edges before
working on the middle section.

[01:10:59 - 01:11:01]
Or maybe you find
the small sections

[01:11:01 - 01:11:04]
to work on before connecting
them to a bigger picture.

[01:11:04 - 01:11:05]
The point is that
it's a deliberate

[01:11:05 - 01:11:07]
process that builds over time.

[01:11:07 - 01:11:10]
That's what prompt
chaining is like.

[01:11:10 - 01:11:12]
Prompt chaining guides
a generative AI tool

[01:11:12 - 01:11:14]
through a series of
interconnected prompts,

[01:11:14 - 01:11:18]
adding new layers of context
or tasks each step of the way.

[01:11:18 - 01:11:21]
Eventually, those
linked prompts help

[01:11:21 - 01:11:24]
the tool solve complex
problems one step at a time,

[01:11:24 - 01:11:26]
just like putting
together a puzzle.

[01:11:26 - 01:11:28]
Here's how we can put
that to work for you.

[01:11:28 - 01:11:30]
Have you ever
taken time off work

[01:11:30 - 01:11:31]
and needed to catch
up on what you missed?

[01:11:31 - 01:11:34]
You could prompt a
GenAI tool to summarize

[01:11:34 - 01:11:37]
your emails and any documents
you receive while you were gone.

[01:11:37 - 01:11:39]
After reviewing
the output, you may

[01:11:39 - 01:11:42]
want to prompt it again to focus
on time-sensitive requests.

[01:11:42 - 01:11:45]
If the new output
reveals an urgent issue,

[01:11:45 - 01:11:48]
you could prompt the tool
again for some solutions on how

[01:11:48 - 01:11:49]
to handle it and on and on.

[01:11:49 - 01:11:52]
With this technique,
you're not just iterating.

[01:11:52 - 01:11:53]
Instead, each
prompt and response

[01:11:53 - 01:11:55]
builds on the previous one.

[01:11:55 - 01:11:57]
You're creating a chain
of prompts together

[01:11:57 - 01:11:58]
in a single sequence.

[01:12:03 - 01:12:05]
Let's demonstrate prompt
chaining in action.

[01:12:05 - 01:12:08]
We'll use Google AI
Studio as it enables

[01:12:08 - 01:12:10]
us to get access
to Gemini models

[01:12:10 - 01:12:12]
with a long context window.

[01:12:12 - 01:12:13]
You just finished
writing a novel.

[01:12:13 - 01:12:15]
Huge accomplishment, right?

[01:12:15 - 01:12:17]
Well, now the other work starts.

[01:12:17 - 01:12:19]
You need to market and sell it.

[01:12:19 - 01:12:22]
So you decide to
create a marketing plan

[01:12:22 - 01:12:23]
to promote the book.

[01:12:23 - 01:12:25]
They claim you can't
judge a book by its cover,

[01:12:25 - 01:12:28]
but it's still important to
make a good first impression.

[01:12:28 - 01:12:32]
First, you'll need a
catchy hook or tagline.

[01:12:32 - 01:12:35]
We can use the prompt framework
to generate some options

[01:12:35 - 01:12:36]
in AI Studio.

[01:12:36 - 01:12:40]
As always, let's be
specific about our task.

[01:12:40 - 01:12:45]
"Generate three options for a
one-sentence summary of this

[01:12:45 - 01:12:47]
novel manuscript."

[01:12:47 - 01:12:51]
The manuscript will provide the
story's background information

[01:12:51 - 01:12:54]
directly, so let's
just specify the tone.

[01:12:54 - 01:12:58]
"The summary should be
similar in voice and tone

[01:12:58 - 01:13:02]
to the manuscript, but
more catchy and engaging."

[01:13:02 - 01:13:03]
OK, let's check out the output.

[01:13:07 - 01:13:08]
These options are
good, but maybe you

[01:13:08 - 01:13:12]
want the tagline to focus on
a specific theme in your book.

[01:13:12 - 01:13:15]
We can write a follow-up
prompt to refine the taglines.

[01:13:15 - 01:13:19]
"Create a tagline that is a
combination of the previous

[01:13:19 - 01:13:24]
three options with a special
focus on the exciting plot

[01:13:24 - 01:13:26]
twists and mystery of the book."

[01:13:26 - 01:13:28]
There's the new context.

[01:13:28 - 01:13:32]
"Find the catchiest and
most impactful combination.

[01:13:32 - 01:13:36]
The tagline should be concise
and leave the reader hooked

[01:13:36 - 01:13:40]
and wanting to read more."

[01:13:40 - 01:13:42]
And we've specified
the task and format.

[01:13:44 - 01:13:45]
Great.

[01:13:45 - 01:13:48]
This is really strong
and gives you a great one

[01:13:48 - 01:13:49]
liner for marketing your book.

[01:13:49 - 01:13:51]
Remember, prompt
chaining isn't just

[01:13:51 - 01:13:54]
about adding more
context to your prompts,

[01:13:54 - 01:13:57]
it's about expanding on what
the GenAI tool has previously

[01:13:57 - 01:13:58]
generated.

[01:13:58 - 01:14:00]
This is a little
different from iteration

[01:14:00 - 01:14:02]
in the prompt
framework since that

[01:14:02 - 01:14:06]
focuses on adjusting a given
prompt to improve the results.

[01:14:06 - 01:14:09]
Here, you want to use its
output as a building block

[01:14:09 - 01:14:11]
for more complex requests.

[01:14:11 - 01:14:14]
This brings us back to
the tagline you generated.

[01:14:14 - 01:14:16]
It's a great starting
point for the next piece

[01:14:16 - 01:14:17]
in your prompt chain.

[01:14:17 - 01:14:20]
You want to generate a blurb
for the back cover of the book.

[01:14:20 - 01:14:23]
Let's continue.

[01:14:23 - 01:14:28]
"Create a five-sentence summary
of the entire manuscript below

[01:14:28 - 01:14:32]
that expands on the
one-sentence summary."

[01:14:32 - 01:14:34]
OK, so we like this summary.

[01:14:34 - 01:14:36]
We could iterate on it, of
course, but for the moment,

[01:14:36 - 01:14:38]
let's use this output as the
first step in your chaining

[01:14:38 - 01:14:39]
process.

[01:14:39 - 01:14:41]
With your tagline
and blurb set, it's

[01:14:41 - 01:14:43]
time to think about
your book tour.

[01:14:43 - 01:14:45]
Will you promote it
in local bookstores,

[01:14:45 - 01:14:47]
stores that specialize
in your book's genre?

[01:14:47 - 01:14:49]
Let's continue to
build the chain

[01:14:49 - 01:14:52]
and generate a plan based
on what we've already told

[01:14:52 - 01:14:54]
the GenAI tool about your book.

[01:14:54 - 01:14:56]
Since the model has already
analyzed your manuscript

[01:14:56 - 01:14:59]
and remembers the conversation
thanks to the long context

[01:14:59 - 01:15:03]
window, just provide
the new task.

[01:15:03 - 01:15:07]
"Generate a six-week promotional
plan for a book tour,

[01:15:07 - 01:15:11]
including what locations I
should visit and what channels I

[01:15:11 - 01:15:14]
should utilize to promote
each stop on the tour."

[01:15:18 - 01:15:19]
Awesome.

[01:15:19 - 01:15:20]
You've got a plan.

[01:15:20 - 01:15:22]
And of course, you can iterate
on any of these prompts

[01:15:22 - 01:15:26]
if you're not happy with the
options the GenAI tool provided.

[01:15:26 - 01:15:28]
That's the power
of prompt chaining.

[01:15:28 - 01:15:30]
All it took was a
series of prompts

[01:15:30 - 01:15:33]
and we guided the Gemini
model in AI Studio

[01:15:33 - 01:15:36]
to write taglines, summaries,
and a plan for the book tour.

[01:15:48 - 01:15:51]
Here are two advanced prompt
chaining techniques you can try.

[01:15:51 - 01:15:55]
The first is Chain-of-Thought
prompting, or COT.

[01:15:55 - 01:15:59]
COT prompting asks the GenAI
tool to explain its reasoning

[01:15:59 - 01:16:04]
or to describe step by step how
it got to a specific result.

[01:16:04 - 01:16:07]
It's similar to the way math
teachers ask students to explain

[01:16:07 - 01:16:09]
how they got to an answer.

[01:16:09 - 01:16:12]
This method can help you
understand the GenAI tool's

[01:16:12 - 01:16:15]
reasoning methods, which
can help you make better

[01:16:15 - 01:16:17]
decisions based on its outputs.

[01:16:17 - 01:16:19]
For example, you might
need help deciding

[01:16:19 - 01:16:21]
how to balance visiting
all six book tour

[01:16:21 - 01:16:24]
locations with a limited
budget or time constraints.

[01:16:24 - 01:16:28]
You could prompt the GenAI tool
for ideas on how to solve this,

[01:16:28 - 01:16:31]
but this time, you include
"explain your thought process"

[01:16:31 - 01:16:33]
in your initial prompt.

[01:16:33 - 01:16:36]
That way, you can evaluate
the logic behind each proposed

[01:16:36 - 01:16:37]
solution.

[01:16:37 - 01:16:40]
A related concept is
Tree-of-Thought prompting,

[01:16:40 - 01:16:41]
or TOT.

[01:16:41 - 01:16:44]
Tree of thought
involves asking the tool

[01:16:44 - 01:16:48]
to explore multiple reasoning
paths at once, like branches

[01:16:48 - 01:16:49]
growing on a tree.

[01:16:49 - 01:16:53]
TOT enables the tool to explore
multiple solutions to a given

[01:16:53 - 01:16:54]
problem.

[01:16:54 - 01:16:58]
It evaluates as it goes, which
helps you get the best outcome.

[01:16:58 - 01:16:59]
It's going through a maze.

[01:16:59 - 01:17:01]
Your goal is to get
to the end, but you

[01:17:01 - 01:17:03]
may have to follow a
couple of different paths

[01:17:03 - 01:17:04]
before you get there.

[01:17:04 - 01:17:06]
This method is
particularly helpful

[01:17:06 - 01:17:09]
when solving abstract
problems like developing

[01:17:09 - 01:17:12]
a plot for the novel
sequel with new characters

[01:17:12 - 01:17:14]
and complex storylines.

[01:17:14 - 01:17:17]
These techniques can be really
useful for creating outlines

[01:17:17 - 01:17:22]
or drafting small sections of
longer documents at work, too.

[01:17:22 - 01:17:24]
Prompt chaining
gives you the chance

[01:17:24 - 01:17:26]
to explore more
complicated ideas

[01:17:26 - 01:17:28]
and generate
interesting responses.

[01:17:28 - 01:17:30]
You might even
uncover some insights

[01:17:30 - 01:17:31]
you could miss with
a single prompt.

[01:17:45 - 01:17:48]
I work at a tech company, but
I don't have a traditional tech

[01:17:48 - 01:17:49]
background.

[01:17:49 - 01:17:51]
A lot of what I know is
self-taught or something

[01:17:51 - 01:17:52]
I learned on the job.

[01:17:52 - 01:17:54]
There are lots of things
I'm curious about,

[01:17:54 - 01:17:58]
but it's tough to find the
right time or place to ask.

[01:17:58 - 01:18:00]
One great thing about
generative AI tools

[01:18:00 - 01:18:03]
is that they can create a safe
space for me to ask questions.

[01:18:03 - 01:18:06]
Instead of getting
embarrassed or avoiding it,

[01:18:06 - 01:18:10]
I can get expert advice from AI
tool with just a few prompts.

[01:18:10 - 01:18:12]
With the right
prompting techniques,

[01:18:12 - 01:18:14]
you can transform
your GenAI tool

[01:18:14 - 01:18:16]
into your own team of
experts ready to help

[01:18:16 - 01:18:18]
you take on any challenge.

[01:18:18 - 01:18:21]
These are called AI agents.

[01:18:21 - 01:18:23]
And while they don't have
secret night vision glasses

[01:18:23 - 01:18:26]
or rocket-powered
sports cars, they

[01:18:26 - 01:18:29]
are incredibly effective
at helping you do your job.

[01:18:29 - 01:18:32]
You can create AI agents
for different purposes

[01:18:32 - 01:18:33]
depending on what you need--

[01:18:33 - 01:18:36]
a coding partner or
a creative soundboard

[01:18:36 - 01:18:38]
or even an accountability
buddy to keep you

[01:18:38 - 01:18:40]
on track with your goals.

[01:18:40 - 01:18:44]
We're going to learn about two
different types of AI agents.

[01:18:44 - 01:18:47]
We'll assign them names
so it's easy to follow.

[01:18:47 - 01:18:50]
The first one, let's
call it Agent Sim,

[01:18:50 - 01:18:53]
helps you simulate
scenarios like interviews

[01:18:53 - 01:18:56]
or roleplaying a difficult
conversation so you

[01:18:56 - 01:18:58]
can practice and change
your approach as needed.

[01:18:58 - 01:19:03]
And the second, Agent X, gives
you feedback on whatever topic

[01:19:03 - 01:19:05]
you prompt it to
be an expert on.

[01:19:05 - 01:19:08]
Think of Agent X like a
personalized consultant.

[01:19:08 - 01:19:12]
Let's start with Agent
X Sim, a simulation.

[01:19:12 - 01:19:15]
You've been asked to create a
training program to help interns

[01:19:15 - 01:19:19]
improve their interview skills
to help them get new positions.

[01:19:19 - 01:19:21]
Let's go through a
series of prompts

[01:19:21 - 01:19:25]
that will help us create
this AI agent in Gemini.

[01:19:25 - 01:19:30]
"Act as a career development
training simulator."

[01:19:30 - 01:19:32]
To make this agent
effective, we need

[01:19:32 - 01:19:35]
to provide a lot of detail
and background information

[01:19:35 - 01:19:37]
about the persona.

[01:19:37 - 01:19:42]
"Your task is to help interns
master interview skills

[01:19:42 - 01:19:47]
and conduct conversations
with potential managers."

[01:19:47 - 01:19:48]
Now let's set the scene.

[01:19:48 - 01:19:50]
To do that, we'll
give it benchmarks

[01:19:50 - 01:19:53]
about what it actually needs
to provide in the outputs.

[01:19:53 - 01:19:55]
In this case, and for
a lot of simulation

[01:19:55 - 01:19:58]
or roleplaying AI
agents like this,

[01:19:58 - 01:20:00]
you need to specify the
types of conversations

[01:20:00 - 01:20:02]
you want it to have.

[01:20:02 - 01:20:05]
"You need to support
the following types

[01:20:05 - 01:20:09]
of conversations-- articulating
strengths and skills,

[01:20:09 - 01:20:12]
communicating professionally
and confidently,

[01:20:12 - 01:20:16]
discussing future career
development goals."

[01:20:16 - 01:20:19]
We could stop there and
let the tool process.

[01:20:19 - 01:20:21]
It's not necessary, but
it can help the output.

[01:20:21 - 01:20:25]
For our purposes, let's just
continue the same prompt.

[01:20:25 - 01:20:29]
"Once an intern has picked
a conversation topic,

[01:20:29 - 01:20:32]
provide details about the
situation and the interviewer's

[01:20:32 - 01:20:34]
role.

[01:20:34 - 01:20:37]
Then act as the interviewer
and allow the intern

[01:20:37 - 01:20:40]
to participate as the employee.

[01:20:40 - 01:20:43]
Make sure to guide the
conversation in a way that will

[01:20:43 - 01:20:49]
allow the intern to exercise
their interview skills."

[01:20:49 - 01:20:51]
Notice how much detail
we're giving it to help

[01:20:51 - 01:20:55]
ensure that the conversations
proceed the way we want them to.

[01:20:55 - 01:20:57]
And now we're
going to add a stop

[01:20:57 - 01:21:00]
phrase to indicate when and
how the roleplay can end.

[01:21:00 - 01:21:02]
This could be anything--

[01:21:02 - 01:21:04]
"The end," "That's a
wrap," "End scene,"

[01:21:04 - 01:21:07]
or something a little
fun, like jazz hands.

[01:21:07 - 01:21:14]
"Continue the roleplay until the
intern replies with jazz hands.

[01:21:14 - 01:21:18]
After the intern gives
the stop rule, jazz hands,

[01:21:18 - 01:21:22]
provide them with key takeaways
from the simulation and skills

[01:21:22 - 01:21:25]
they can work on."

[01:21:25 - 01:21:27]
OK, let's review our prompt.

[01:21:27 - 01:21:31]
We've specified the
role, "Act as," the task,

[01:21:31 - 01:21:34]
"Your task is to," and
the intended outcome,

[01:21:34 - 01:21:36]
"The skills specified."

[01:21:36 - 01:21:39]
We also provided plenty
of details and background

[01:21:39 - 01:21:40]
to set the scene.

[01:21:40 - 01:21:41]
It's time to start
the simulation

[01:21:41 - 01:21:43]
and have a real conversation.

[01:21:43 - 01:21:47]
Let's use articulating strengths
and skills and test it out.

[01:21:47 - 01:21:48]
OK, here we go.

[01:21:48 - 01:21:51]
It's asking me to tell it
a bit about my strengths

[01:21:51 - 01:21:53]
and why I would make a
good fit for the role.

[01:21:53 - 01:21:54]
I'll respond.

[01:21:54 - 01:21:59]
"My top strength is translating
complex marketing concepts

[01:21:59 - 01:22:03]
into clear, engaging messages
that resonate with diverse

[01:22:03 - 01:22:04]
audiences."

[01:22:06 - 01:22:07]
Great.

[01:22:07 - 01:22:09]
Gemini is doing its job.

[01:22:09 - 01:22:11]
The response is
encouraging, and now it's

[01:22:11 - 01:22:13]
asking me for a
specific example.

[01:22:13 - 01:22:14]
Here's what I'll write.

[01:22:14 - 01:22:20]
Yes, I designed a marketing
campaign for a local company who

[01:22:20 - 01:22:24]
sells custom jewelry online."

[01:22:24 - 01:22:27]
OK, let's check
out the response.

[01:22:27 - 01:22:29]
Agent Sim is impressed.

[01:22:29 - 01:22:30]
OK, I'm ready.

[01:22:30 - 01:22:31]
I'll type my stop rule.

[01:22:31 - 01:22:34]
"Jazz hands."

[01:22:34 - 01:22:37]
Now in the original prompt, we
told it to provide key takeaways

[01:22:37 - 01:22:38]
from the simulation.

[01:22:38 - 01:22:41]
Let's make sure.

[01:22:41 - 01:22:44]
Yes, it responded
that I did a great job

[01:22:44 - 01:22:46]
citing specific examples
and demonstrating

[01:22:46 - 01:22:48]
enthusiasm and value.

[01:22:48 - 01:22:50]
That's good.

[01:22:50 - 01:22:51]
Ah.

[01:22:51 - 01:22:53]
And here, we can find the
areas for improvement,

[01:22:53 - 01:22:56]
which include being more concise
and tailoring my answers better.

[01:22:56 - 01:22:58]
This is so helpful.

[01:22:58 - 01:23:00]
This is one of the
most interesting ways

[01:23:00 - 01:23:03]
to interact with a GenAI
tool because there are so

[01:23:03 - 01:23:04]
many possibilities.

[01:23:04 - 01:23:06]
You can even upload
a job description

[01:23:06 - 01:23:09]
and prompt the tool to ask
interview questions based

[01:23:09 - 01:23:10]
on the job's criteria.

[01:23:10 - 01:23:13]
Another example, you
can design a prompt

[01:23:13 - 01:23:15]
to make the AI agent
take on different roles

[01:23:15 - 01:23:17]
you might encounter
in the workplace.

[01:23:17 - 01:23:20]
And use it to simulate
conversations, meetings,

[01:23:20 - 01:23:21]
and feedback sessions.

[01:23:33 - 01:23:35]
We're done with
Agent Sim for now.

[01:23:35 - 01:23:38]
Let's move on to the
second type of AI agent,

[01:23:38 - 01:23:42]
Agent X. Think of Agent X as
your personalized consultant.

[01:23:42 - 01:23:45]
With the right prompt, you
can instruct your agent

[01:23:45 - 01:23:47]
to be an expert on
anything you need.

[01:23:47 - 01:23:49]
In this example, we
need our AI agent

[01:23:49 - 01:23:53]
to provide expert feedback on
a pitch for a potential client.

[01:23:53 - 01:23:56]
Since this prompt will include
a lot of context and information

[01:23:56 - 01:23:58]
about the potential
client, we'll

[01:23:58 - 01:24:00]
need to use a long
context window that

[01:24:00 - 01:24:03]
allows the generative AI
tool to retain and utilize

[01:24:03 - 01:24:06]
more information, leading
to better responses.

[01:24:06 - 01:24:08]
So we'll switch to
Google AI Studio.

[01:24:08 - 01:24:12]
"You're my potential client,
the VP of Advertising

[01:24:12 - 01:24:15]
at a world-famous sports
car company known for its

[01:24:15 - 01:24:19]
innovation, performance,
and engineering excellence."

[01:24:19 - 01:24:21]
OK, it's got the
persona and background,

[01:24:21 - 01:24:24]
but we need to set up the
interactive conversation a bit.

[01:24:24 - 01:24:26]
Let's set the scene.

[01:24:26 - 01:24:29]
"You're considering
hiring a creative agency

[01:24:29 - 01:24:33]
to develop a new campaign
that will attract

[01:24:33 - 01:24:35]
a younger generation of buyers.

[01:24:35 - 01:24:37]
You are in a meeting with
me, the design director

[01:24:37 - 01:24:40]
of a creative agency, that's
pitching a new campaign

[01:24:40 - 01:24:43]
for your company."

[01:24:43 - 01:24:45]
We could put the
whole pitch in here,

[01:24:45 - 01:24:47]
"Act as my potential client.

[01:24:47 - 01:24:50]
When I provide answers,
critique the answers.

[01:24:50 - 01:24:53]
If needed, ask
follow-up questions.

[01:24:53 - 01:24:58]
Continue the conversation until
I give the stop rule, Break.

[01:24:58 - 01:25:02]
Then give me a summary of the
whole conversation highlighting

[01:25:02 - 01:25:05]
ways I can improve my pitch."

[01:25:05 - 01:25:08]
We'll upload the brief
the client gave us here.

[01:25:08 - 01:25:10]
That way, the model
will critique the pitch

[01:25:10 - 01:25:13]
through the client's
point of view.

[01:25:13 - 01:25:17]
"I've included the brief
the car company provided me

[01:25:17 - 01:25:21]
that has all the relevant
information for this project.

[01:25:21 - 01:25:26]
Use the information from this
brief to inform your answers."

[01:25:26 - 01:25:28]
This was another
long, involved prompt.

[01:25:28 - 01:25:30]
Let's review it, keeping
in mind that we're still

[01:25:30 - 01:25:32]
using our prompt framework.

[01:25:32 - 01:25:34]
We started by setting
up the role of the VP

[01:25:34 - 01:25:38]
before establishing what we
want the GenAI tool to do,

[01:25:38 - 01:25:41]
which is to critique the pitch
and ask follow-up questions.

[01:25:41 - 01:25:43]
We also specified
our intended outcome,

[01:25:43 - 01:25:47]
which involved highlighting
ways the pitch can get better.

[01:25:47 - 01:25:51]
OK, time to converse.

[01:25:51 - 01:25:53]
It's asking for more details.

[01:25:57 - 01:25:58]
Let's check out the response.

[01:26:01 - 01:26:05]
Uh oh, there are still some
concerns that need addressing.

[01:26:05 - 01:26:08]
That's super helpful
for this practice round.

[01:26:08 - 01:26:11]
Let's type the stop rule now
and evaluate the feedback.

[01:26:11 - 01:26:13]
"Break."

[01:26:13 - 01:26:15]
Nice.

[01:26:15 - 01:26:18]
The AI agent has given a
summary of the conversation

[01:26:18 - 01:26:21]
so far, what's
working and what needs

[01:26:21 - 01:26:25]
improvement, and recommendations
to strengthen the pitch.

[01:26:25 - 01:26:27]
Wonderful.

[01:26:27 - 01:26:30]
Now that the GenAI tool
is acting as your client,

[01:26:30 - 01:26:33]
you can continue asking
for feedback on the pitch.

[01:26:33 - 01:26:35]
Remember to save
your prompt so you

[01:26:35 - 01:26:39]
can return to this conversation
after you revise your pitch

[01:26:39 - 01:26:43]
to help you test more ideas as
you hone in on a final version.

[01:26:43 - 01:26:47]
You can even create customized
versions of Gemini called Gems.

[01:26:47 - 01:26:49]
Simply describe what
you want your Gem to do

[01:26:49 - 01:26:52]
and how you want it
to respond, and Gemini

[01:26:52 - 01:26:54]
will take those instructions
and help you create

[01:26:54 - 01:26:56]
a Gem for your specific needs.

[01:27:09 - 01:27:11]
Throughout this
course, you've learned

[01:27:11 - 01:27:15]
how to thoughtfully create
really excellent inputs out

[01:27:15 - 01:27:15]
of prompt.

[01:27:15 - 01:27:17]
Like most skills,
you're prompting

[01:27:17 - 01:27:21]
abilities will improve through
experimentation and practice.

[01:27:21 - 01:27:25]
You can save a ton of time by
noting which prompts work best

[01:27:25 - 01:27:26]
and for what use cases.

[01:27:26 - 01:27:29]
I encourage you to keep track
and go back to determine

[01:27:29 - 01:27:31]
what's worked and what hasn't.

[01:27:31 - 01:27:34]
That's where prompt
versioning comes in.

[01:27:34 - 01:27:36]
Prompt versioning
is a way to keep

[01:27:36 - 01:27:39]
track of the different versions
of your prompts over time.

[01:27:39 - 01:27:42]
It's a powerful way to capture
your most effective prompts,

[01:27:42 - 01:27:46]
track your progress, and develop
your GenAI prompting skills.

[01:27:46 - 01:27:47]
And here's a tip--

[01:27:47 - 01:27:50]
you can name your
most effective prompts

[01:27:50 - 01:27:53]
and store them in your personal
prompt library for easy access

[01:27:53 - 01:27:54]
in the future.

[01:27:54 - 01:27:56]
In fact, some
generative AI tools

[01:27:56 - 01:28:00]
allow you to name and save your
prompts right inside the tool.

[01:28:00 - 01:28:02]
Imagine you're doing meal
prep for your family.

[01:28:02 - 01:28:05]
You found a set of
meals you really like,

[01:28:05 - 01:28:07]
but you want to start
experimenting with new cuisines.

[01:28:07 - 01:28:09]
You wouldn't scrap
your entire meal plan

[01:28:09 - 01:28:11]
and start again, right?

[01:28:11 - 01:28:13]
You'd use what you've
already learned about things

[01:28:13 - 01:28:16]
like preferences,
portions, and allergies

[01:28:16 - 01:28:18]
and use that as a base to
create a new weekly menu

[01:28:18 - 01:28:19]
for your family.

[01:28:19 - 01:28:22]
The same goes for
prompt versioning.

[01:28:22 - 01:28:23]
Once you have a
prompt that works,

[01:28:23 - 01:28:25]
you don't need to
reinvent the wheel.

[01:28:25 - 01:28:28]
You can experiment with
different tasks, contexts,

[01:28:28 - 01:28:31]
and references to get different
results based on what you need.

[01:28:31 - 01:28:35]
For example, you can develop
a reusable prompt for emails.

[01:28:35 - 01:28:38]
The GenAI tool will
draft the email for you,

[01:28:38 - 01:28:40]
but you can adjust
the tone and format

[01:28:40 - 01:28:42]
based on the audience
you're communicating with.

[01:28:42 - 01:28:44]
Or you could use a single
source of information

[01:28:44 - 01:28:46]
to create different
frequently asked

[01:28:46 - 01:28:49]
questions sections dedicated
to different types of customers

[01:28:49 - 01:28:51]
that visit your website.

[01:28:51 - 01:28:52]
You can tweak the
prompt that generated

[01:28:52 - 01:28:56]
the FAQ for individual
consumers and change the persona

[01:28:56 - 01:28:59]
to make an FAQ for
enterprise customers.

[01:28:59 - 01:29:01]
Think about all the prompts
we've created in this course.

[01:29:01 - 01:29:04]
What versions can you
create for your needs?

[01:29:04 - 01:29:06]
Playing and experimenting
with prompts

[01:29:06 - 01:29:09]
is the best way to figure
out how to get what you want,

[01:29:09 - 01:29:12]
and the only way to get there
is to get comfortable, explore,

[01:29:12 - 01:29:14]
and learn what
path works for you.

[01:29:14 - 01:29:16]
And remember, you're not alone.

[01:29:16 - 01:29:19]
There's a big community
of folks out there

[01:29:19 - 01:29:21]
that are sharing prompts
that have worked for them so

[01:29:21 - 01:29:24]
that people can learn from
each other's successes,

[01:29:24 - 01:29:26]
find inspiration, and support.

[01:29:26 - 01:29:29]
Participating in that
community is a great way

[01:29:29 - 01:29:31]
to improve your prompting
skills and build a network.

[01:29:43 - 01:29:44]
AMINA: Congrats.

[01:29:44 - 01:29:46]
You just learned a
lot, and you should

[01:29:46 - 01:29:49]
be really proud of all the
work you put into this course.

[01:29:49 - 01:29:53]
Prompting is key to unlocking
the power of generative AI.

[01:29:53 - 01:29:55]
You've learned how
to do everything

[01:29:55 - 01:29:59]
from writing simple text prompts
to creating your own personal AI

[01:29:59 - 01:29:59]
agent.

[01:29:59 - 01:30:01]
You learned how
to gradually build

[01:30:01 - 01:30:04]
on the complexity of your
prompts to get useful outputs,

[01:30:04 - 01:30:07]
from helping you draft emails
to summarizing documents

[01:30:07 - 01:30:11]
and to creating
engaging presentations.

[01:30:11 - 01:30:13]
You've learned how to
draw insights out of data,

[01:30:13 - 01:30:16]
create advanced prompts,
and turn GenAI tools

[01:30:16 - 01:30:18]
into creative collaborators.

[01:30:18 - 01:30:23]
But remember, it's vital that
you use these tools responsibly.

[01:30:23 - 01:30:25]
I'm so glad to have been
a part of your journey,

[01:30:25 - 01:30:28]
and I encourage you to keep
experimenting with GenAI

[01:30:28 - 01:30:30]
so that you can figure out
how to make these tools

[01:30:30 - 01:30:31]
work for you.

[01:30:31 - 01:30:34]
The best way to do that is
to get out there and write

[01:30:34 - 01:30:35]
your own prompts.

[01:30:35 - 01:30:37]
Now go get started.

[01:30:37 - 01:30:40]

### 13. @kelvincumbane.y (👍 0)
To be great prompter you must know what result are you looking for.

PS: In general, if you want to be great prompter don't ask the AI to do something that you don't know how to do. 
If not so what are you going to iterate?

Good training, though I think you need to also share how much these Google AI Studio prompts are going to cost. A simple 115 token job using Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B would have been $8-9 just for the input and who knows for the output. I tried the example of summarizing a policy document of mine and it was going to cost $45k!!!! Yes, 45 thousand dollars. I backed away from the "enter" key and thanked goodness that I didn't run it. I'm hoping I did something wrong here. Please advise.
