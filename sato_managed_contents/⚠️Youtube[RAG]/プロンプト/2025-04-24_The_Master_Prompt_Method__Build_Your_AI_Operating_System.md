[00:00 - 00:06]
Let's do this. Welcome everyone. Great

[00:03 - 00:09]
to I can't quite see you all but I can

[00:06 - 00:12]
sense you as the chat over here goes

[00:09 - 00:17]
crazy. Welcome to this workshop, this

[00:12 - 00:19]
virtual workshop on the master prompt

[00:17 - 00:21]
method. Uh this has been a long time

[00:19 - 00:25]
coming. This has been a long time coming

[00:21 - 00:28]
and I'm just so excited to share with

[00:25 - 00:30]
you all uh some stuff that I think is is

[00:28 - 00:32]
kind of going to blow your mind. Uh in

[00:30 - 00:33]
fact, I can I can pretty much say it's

[00:32 - 00:36]
going to blow your mind even if you're

[00:33 - 00:39]
someone who has been following what's

[00:36 - 00:39]
happening in artificial

[00:39 - 00:45]
intelligence. Before we get started, I

[00:42 - 00:47]
have a couple requests. One is to

[00:45 - 00:48]
actually I don't because we don't have

[00:47 - 00:50]
cameras. So, I'm not going to ask you to

[00:48 - 00:52]
turn on your cameras cuz we are in

[00:50 - 00:56]
webinar mode. Um, but the other one I

[00:52 - 00:58]
will ask, which is to tell us your

[00:56 - 01:00]
questions. We're really here to answer

[00:58 - 01:03]
your questions. We're going to have

[01:00 - 01:05]
plenty of time to answer all of them.

[01:03 - 01:07]
And the ideal way to do that is not in

[01:05 - 01:10]
the chat. So, if you're used to the

[01:07 - 01:12]
typical Zoom meeting format, that's done

[01:10 - 01:14]
in the chat. But, we're in webinar mode.

[01:12 - 01:18]
So we have a dedicated if you look on

[01:14 - 01:21]
the Zoom toolbar there a Q&A

[01:18 - 01:24]
button. Okay. So if you press that Q&A

[01:21 - 01:26]
button right now actually you can see

[01:24 - 01:29]
that there's a special interface for you

[01:26 - 01:31]
to put in questions and then also you

[01:29 - 01:33]
can upvote other people's questions. So

[01:31 - 01:35]
we're going to prioritize the questions

[01:33 - 01:37]
that are most update that are most

[01:35 - 01:40]
upvoted. And so I encourage you to both

[01:37 - 01:42]
ask and vote on the questions you want

[01:40 - 01:45]
to see answered.

[01:42 - 01:47]
One more thing which is uh we have maxed

[01:45 - 01:50]
out the thousand person limit on our

[01:47 - 01:53]
zoom call. So many of you are joining

[01:50 - 01:56]
via the YouTube live stream. So I

[01:53 - 01:59]
welcome you as well. I will try to go

[01:56 - 02:01]
over to the YouTube uh live stream chat

[01:59 - 02:05]
and answer some of your questions as

[02:01 - 02:07]
well. Uh and so uh listen for the Q&A

[02:05 - 02:09]
section when I'll head over to the the

[02:07 - 02:11]
YouTube live stream and and address some

[02:09 - 02:14]
of those as well.

[02:11 - 02:15]
All right. And because I know this

[02:14 - 02:17]
question is going to be asked already,

[02:15 - 02:19]
there will be a full recording from the

[02:17 - 02:21]
very beginning to the very end sent to

[02:19 - 02:23]
every single person that's registered

[02:21 - 02:26]
for this call. Whether you were able to

[02:23 - 02:28]
join the Zoom webinar or you were on the

[02:26 - 02:30]
YouTube live stream. As long as you're

[02:28 - 02:32]
registered via the event page that we

[02:30 - 02:34]
sent out, then you're going to be

[02:32 - 02:38]
good.

[02:34 - 02:41]
Okay. All right. So, let's begin with

[02:38 - 02:44]
introductions. Okay. Uh, I'll go first

[02:41 - 02:46]
and then I'll ask my my partner here,

[02:44 - 02:50]
Hayden, to introduce

[02:46 - 02:52]
himself. And I know many of you probably

[02:50 - 02:54]
know me or know of me, you probably are

[02:52 - 02:56]
here because of a link or an

[02:54 - 02:59]
announcement that I posted in some

[02:56 - 03:02]
place. Um, but just in case you don't or

[02:59 - 03:05]
just in case uh you found this on social

[03:02 - 03:07]
media or something, the short version of

[03:05 - 03:10]
my story

[03:07 - 03:13]
is almost 20 years ago, about 18 years

[03:10 - 03:16]
ago, I started coming down. I started

[03:13 - 03:18]
experiencing this mysterious

[03:16 - 03:21]
uh illness, this condition, which was

[03:18 - 03:23]
this like pain and tension and numbness

[03:21 - 03:26]
in the right side of my neck and my

[03:23 - 03:28]
throat. like for no reason, no apparent

[03:26 - 03:31]
cause, just out of the blue one

[03:28 - 03:34]
day. And that kicked off a years'sl long

[03:31 - 03:37]
odyssey of me seeing so many different

[03:34 - 03:39]
kinds of doctors in multiple countries

[03:37 - 03:43]
trying every treatment you can imagine.

[03:39 - 03:46]
Uh never really finding uh exactly what

[03:43 - 03:49]
was the cause. And the medication that I

[03:46 - 03:51]
took for that caused symptoms really

[03:49 - 03:55]
severe symptoms like severe short-term

[03:51 - 03:58]
memory loss real problems focusing a lot

[03:55 - 04:01]
of mental cognitive

[03:58 - 04:03]
problems. So the only real answer that I

[04:01 - 04:06]
found the solution I found was to start

[04:03 - 04:08]
relying on technology to start relying

[04:06 - 04:10]
on software. So, I started kind of

[04:08 - 04:12]
offloading my brain, my ideas, my

[04:10 - 04:16]
memories, my to-dos, my projects, my

[04:12 - 04:19]
schoolwork at the time onto a category

[04:16 - 04:22]
of software called digital note-taking

[04:19 - 04:24]
apps. And those apps kind of saved my

[04:22 - 04:27]
life. Really changed everything for me.

[04:24 - 04:29]
I thought my life was over. I had no

[04:27 - 04:32]
future. And because of this technology

[04:29 - 04:34]
being available, I was able to not only,

[04:32 - 04:37]
you know, survive, but start a business

[04:34 - 04:40]
and become a writer and start a family

[04:37 - 04:44]
and all these goals that I had for my

[04:40 - 04:47]
life. So around 10 years ago, I began

[04:44 - 04:50]
realizing that this deficiency, what I

[04:47 - 04:52]
thought was a deficiency or disability,

[04:50 - 04:55]
had actually become a superpower. And I

[04:52 - 04:57]
began to teach it. I began to blog about

[04:55 - 05:00]
it. I began to do corporate workshops. I

[04:57 - 05:03]
began to to teach uh li live

[05:00 - 05:06]
cohort-based courses on this topic of

[05:03 - 05:08]
how to build a second brain, which is

[05:06 - 05:09]
how I began to think of my digital

[05:08 - 05:13]
note-taking

[05:09 - 05:15]
app. Uh around three years ago, I

[05:13 - 05:17]
packaged all of that knowledge and

[05:15 - 05:19]
experience and expertise into a book

[05:17 - 05:22]
called Building a Second Brain, which

[05:19 - 05:25]
has now sold over 350,000 copies in over

[05:22 - 05:28]
30 countries and 20 something languages,

[05:25 - 05:30]
which just completely blows my mind, no

[05:28 - 05:33]
pun intended, because I really thought

[05:30 - 05:34]
it was this tiny nerdy niche interest

[05:33 - 05:37]
that I had that apparently a lot of

[05:34 - 05:42]
people have resonated

[05:37 - 05:44]
with. Finally, uh about 18 months ago or

[05:42 - 05:47]
or between 18 months and two years ago,

[05:44 - 05:49]
uh I stopped teaching. It's actually

[05:47 - 05:51]
surprising to a lot of people. Uh I

[05:49 - 05:53]
stopped teaching the building of second

[05:51 - 05:55]
brain cohorts and we stopped offering

[05:53 - 05:58]
them. And I didn't really share this at

[05:55 - 06:01]
the time, but one of the main reasons

[05:58 - 06:04]
for that is because of AI. I saw this AI

[06:01 - 06:06]
wave coming and I realized, oh my gosh,

[06:04 - 06:07]
this is all going to change. Note-taking

[06:06 - 06:10]
is going to change. knowledge

[06:07 - 06:12]
management productivity business all

[06:10 - 06:14]
these topics that I teach about are

[06:12 - 06:18]
going to completely change and I cannot

[06:14 - 06:21]
in good conscious in good conscience uh

[06:18 - 06:23]
keep uh advocating for a pre-I way of

[06:21 - 06:26]
doing those things. So I put it all to a

[06:23 - 06:29]
stop and I've spent the last 18 plus

[06:26 - 06:32]
months uh really deeply immersed in

[06:29 - 06:33]
studying and experimenting and trying to

[06:32 - 06:36]
figure out you know doing small

[06:33 - 06:39]
workshops and small events trying to

[06:36 - 06:42]
figure out what this new era is about

[06:39 - 06:44]
like what it means to live in an AI

[06:42 - 06:47]
first world what productivity looks like

[06:44 - 06:50]
in an AI you know transformed um

[06:47 - 06:51]
business uh environment all these kinds

[06:50 - 06:53]
of

[06:51 - 06:55]
questions And I feel like I now have an

[06:53 - 06:56]
answer. Okay, which is why I'm so

[06:55 - 06:58]
excited about this. I feel like I've

[06:56 - 07:00]
been wandering in the desert. I've been

[06:58 - 07:04]
on this epic journey and I'm coming back

[07:00 - 07:06]
and I I've found something uh really

[07:04 - 07:08]
amazing that that I think even if you

[07:06 - 07:11]
don't join the program that we're

[07:08 - 07:13]
introducing today, just the distinctions

[07:11 - 07:15]
and the perspectives and the lenses that

[07:13 - 07:17]
we introduce on this call, I think are

[07:15 - 07:19]
going to be really really helpful for

[07:17 - 07:23]
you in just understanding and uh

[07:19 - 07:23]
adapting to what's happening in AI.

[07:24 - 07:30]
All right. So, a really crucial piece of

[07:27 - 07:32]
this puzzle of what I found that I'm

[07:30 - 07:35]
bringing to you now was meeting Hayden

[07:32 - 07:37]
around 6 months ago. Okay. So, I'll say

[07:35 - 07:40]
a little more about that, but if you

[07:37 - 07:43]
would please, uh, Hayden, welcome by the

[07:40 - 07:45]
way. And uh I would love for you to just

[07:43 - 07:46]
um introduce yourself and give people a

[07:45 - 07:48]
little bit about your background,

[07:46 - 07:51]
although I know we're going to be going

[07:48 - 07:53]
a lot deeper into your background um uh

[07:51 - 07:55]
in a little bit.

[07:53 - 07:58]
For sure. Thanks for having me, Thiago.

[07:55 - 08:02]
Um yeah, my name's Hayden. Um I'm a

[07:58 - 08:04]
serial entrepreneur. I have kind of

[08:02 - 08:06]
always done things my own way, whether

[08:04 - 08:08]
that's a good thing or not. um dropped

[08:06 - 08:10]
out of high school at 17 and started my

[08:08 - 08:14]
first business and have been

[08:10 - 08:17]
self-employed since then. I lived life

[08:14 - 08:19]
pretty fast. Got married at 20, had two

[08:17 - 08:21]
kids. I actually have like a a

[08:19 - 08:24]
21-year-old and a 19-year-old now, and

[08:21 - 08:27]
they're both out of the house now. Um

[08:24 - 08:29]
and also have started about, you know,

[08:27 - 08:31]
almost a dozen seven to eight figure

[08:29 - 08:33]
businesses. uh and then started

[08:31 - 08:35]
acquiring businesses through a few

[08:33 - 08:37]
different old codes over the years. Um

[08:35 - 08:40]
so I've bought you know almost 40

[08:37 - 08:43]
businesses outside of those and sold

[08:40 - 08:47]
close to a dozen as well. Um so I'm a

[08:43 - 08:49]
businessman through and through. Um not

[08:47 - 08:50]
really a public person as Thiago will

[08:49 - 08:52]
tell you. I kind of live in the middle

[08:50 - 08:54]
of the forest.

[08:52 - 08:57]
Um, but there hasn't been a time in the

[08:54 - 08:58]
last five years or so, um, that I've

[08:57 - 09:00]
owned fewer than a dozen companies,

[08:58 - 09:02]
which is kind of unique. Um, and it's

[09:00 - 09:05]
required me to spend a lot of time and

[09:02 - 09:06]
resources in a different side of sort of

[09:05 - 09:08]
what Thiago has been teaching, which is

[09:06 - 09:10]
organ organizational knowledge

[09:08 - 09:13]
management.

[09:10 - 09:16]
Um, my life in business is probably a

[09:13 - 09:19]
little different uh than most. I'd say

[09:16 - 09:21]
outside of just sitting on boards, um my

[09:19 - 09:24]
role today has kind of become like an AI

[09:21 - 09:27]
tinkerer. Um so I have meetings with the

[09:24 - 09:28]
CEOs in my companies usually once or

[09:27 - 09:30]
yeah once or twice a month if they're

[09:28 - 09:32]
newer, maybe once every two to three

[09:30 - 09:34]
months if they're more entrenched. Uh so

[09:32 - 09:38]
that's like maybe five meetings a week

[09:34 - 09:40]
or so. Um and over the past yeah at

[09:38 - 09:42]
least six months I'd say the majority of

[09:40 - 09:44]
those meetings is uh basically

[09:42 - 09:45]
identifying the bottleneck the current

[09:44 - 09:49]
bottleneck in the business and working

[09:45 - 09:52]
with them on how to use AI to unclog it.

[09:49 - 09:54]
Um so yeah that's that's basically what

[09:52 - 09:56]
my life has become is just working with

[09:54 - 09:59]
AI probably 8 to 10 hours a day uh to

[09:56 - 10:02]
figure out sort of new ways to solve

[09:59 - 10:02]
business challenges.

[10:03 - 10:08]
All right. So, that's the perfect segue

[10:09 - 10:13]
to begin sharing my

[10:16 - 10:19]
slides. Okay, so you should be seeing

[10:18 - 10:21]
we're not we're not used to using

[10:19 - 10:23]
webinar mode here, so someone let me

[10:21 - 10:24]
know if you don't see the uh the slides

[10:23 - 10:28]
full

[10:24 - 10:30]
screen. So, that's a good segue to talk

[10:28 - 10:32]
about how we got here. Um, I had a

[10:30 - 10:33]
couple couple people ask me when they

[10:32 - 10:37]
heard about this event, you know, why

[10:33 - 10:38]
why now? Why this? What what's what's

[10:37 - 10:40]
happening now that you're coming out

[10:38 - 10:43]
with this and in such kind of a big

[10:40 - 10:44]
public way. So, now that you know a

[10:43 - 10:46]
little bit about us individually, I want

[10:44 - 10:49]
to I want to tell you a little bit about

[10:46 - 10:52]
how we got here like to this moment to

[10:49 - 10:54]
this workshop. Uh, and then in a minute,

[10:52 - 10:59]
I'd also love to hear what brought you

[10:54 - 11:01]
here. Okay. So, the images here are the

[10:59 - 11:05]
the artist's interpretation, the artist

[11:01 - 11:07]
being AI of uh of this story. So, none

[11:05 - 11:11]
of these are real photos. I hope that's

[11:07 - 11:15]
obvious. But basically the the the brief

[11:11 - 11:18]
story of how we got here is Hayden and I

[11:15 - 11:20]
um spend a lot of time as I've said

[11:18 - 11:22]
immersed in AI as as he mentioned

[11:20 - 11:25]
experimenting with it applying it to our

[11:22 - 11:27]
businesses uh trying to streamline

[11:25 - 11:29]
things make things more

[11:27 - 11:33]
efficient but in two very different

[11:29 - 11:36]
contexts. So Hayden is so let me start

[11:33 - 11:38]
with myself. I'm really focused on the

[11:36 - 11:41]
individual individual personal

[11:38 - 11:44]
productivity, individual creativity, the

[11:41 - 11:46]
creator economy, freelancers,

[11:44 - 11:49]
uh that sort of individual psychology of

[11:46 - 11:51]
how people change their productivity

[11:49 - 11:54]
tools, how they become more productive,

[11:51 - 11:56]
how they learn faster and better, all

[11:54 - 11:59]
these kinds of questions. But I run a

[11:56 - 12:01]
small business. We're five people. I

[11:59 - 12:05]
don't really have much exposure besides

[12:01 - 12:07]
some consulting gigs to how medium and

[12:05 - 12:10]
large businesses are implementing AI or

[12:07 - 12:13]
what that looks like. Hayden does. So

[12:10 - 12:14]
Hayden not only has a much larger

[12:13 - 12:17]
business with a lot more people in it

[12:14 - 12:20]
and complex operations and workflows,

[12:17 - 12:22]
but he actually can see across many

[12:20 - 12:24]
businesses. businesses he owns,

[12:22 - 12:27]
businesses he invests in, businesses

[12:24 - 12:31]
that he uh advises others, his clients

[12:27 - 12:33]
on either buying or selling. And we were

[12:31 - 12:36]
actually introduced around 6 months ago

[12:33 - 12:38]
uh soon after I moved to the small town

[12:36 - 12:40]
in Mexico via de Bravo where Hayden has

[12:38 - 12:42]
lived for 20 years. Uh we were

[12:40 - 12:45]
introduced by a mutual friend, began

[12:42 - 12:47]
playing paddle ball. Uh and after we

[12:45 - 12:51]
after our Friday paddle ball sessions,

[12:47 - 12:55]
we go uh and have tacos. uh our favorite

[12:51 - 12:57]
places uh boar wild boar meat tacos and

[12:55 - 13:00]
just kind of chatting and talking about

[12:57 - 13:03]
stuff and as we were talking we realized

[13:00 - 13:06]
wait a minute we have we we're doing the

[13:03 - 13:08]
same thing but from two perspectives

[13:06 - 13:11]
that are so complimentary that really

[13:08 - 13:13]
that really fit each other and that that

[13:11 - 13:16]
kind of approach the the issue from two

[13:13 - 13:18]
different angles. me from the solo angle

[13:16 - 13:21]
or small teams, him from the large

[13:18 - 13:21]
teams.

[13:23 - 13:29]
Wow. There's like car alarms going off

[13:26 - 13:31]
and construction uh noises. So, let me

[13:29 - 13:34]
know if that's distracting. Uh I've

[13:31 - 13:36]
literally never heard that loud of sound

[13:34 - 13:38]
before in in our

[13:36 - 13:41]
yard. Typical.

[13:38 - 13:45]
Typical. Okay. So, now I'd love to know

[13:41 - 13:45]
from you. I'm gonna open up the chat

[13:47 - 13:52]
here and I'd love to hear uh what brings

[13:50 - 13:56]
you here. And I don't mean, you know, I

[13:52 - 13:57]
saw a link on Facebook or on uh Twitter

[13:56 - 14:00]
and I clicked it and I registered. I

[13:57 - 14:03]
don't mean that how you got here. I

[14:00 - 14:05]
mean, what had you on a weekday, you

[14:03 - 14:08]
know, on on a weekday, uh, set aside

[14:05 - 14:11]
your other priorities, make the time for

[14:08 - 14:12]
this, uh, to attend live or to watch the

[14:11 - 14:17]
recording, uh, if that's what you intend

[14:12 - 14:18]
to do later. What had you make this a

[14:17 - 14:21]
priority and set aside the time to be

[14:18 - 14:21]
here?

[14:33 - 14:37]
Well, the chat is moving so fast I can't

[14:35 - 14:41]
keep up. But let me read some of these.

[14:37 - 14:43]
Uh Vika says uh he's here because he was

[14:41 - 14:45]
curious.

[14:43 - 14:50]
Faith wants to learn more about AI and

[14:45 - 14:50]
how to help evolve and grow uh her

[14:55 - 15:01]
business. Uh MA cousin wants to

[14:58 - 15:03]
futureproof their business and

[15:01 - 15:05]
themsself. Uh Don is a fan of mine and

[15:03 - 15:07]
wants to know what I've been up to,

[15:05 - 15:09]
where I've been the last 18 months.

[15:07 - 15:11]
That's fair. That's fair.

[15:09 - 15:13]
Melanie wants to understand how to use

[15:11 - 15:18]
AI to unclog the bottlenecks associated

[15:13 - 15:18]
with scaling a SASbased startup.

[15:19 - 15:24]
Awesome. Uh George is already using AI

[15:22 - 15:26]
to improve his business and is curious

[15:24 - 15:28]
about what I have to say, what we have

[15:26 - 15:28]
to

[15:29 - 15:37]
say. Okay, awesome. So I I kind of get a

[15:34 - 15:39]
mix of curiosity and also just wanting

[15:37 - 15:40]
some practical advice and use cases for

[15:39 - 15:43]
how to implement this in your business

[15:40 - 15:46]
which is the perfect reason to be

[15:43 - 15:50]
here. Okay. So this is what we're going

[15:46 - 15:52]
to cover. Um this call this me this uh

[15:50 - 15:55]
workshop was originally 60 minutes but

[15:52 - 15:57]
we extended it a couple days ago to 90

[15:55 - 15:59]
minutes uh because we just have so much

[15:57 - 16:02]
to cover. So if you're not able to stay

[15:59 - 16:04]
the full 90 minutes, we'll send you the

[16:02 - 16:06]
reporting. But basically, we're going to

[16:04 - 16:09]
cover four things. So first, a little

[16:06 - 16:11]
bit of context around what is going on

[16:09 - 16:13]
right now, like how we see the current

[16:11 - 16:15]
landscape. And not just in a broad

[16:13 - 16:18]
general way, but we're really going to

[16:15 - 16:21]
focus on a few key distinctions, a few

[16:18 - 16:24]
key like like perspectives that you need

[16:21 - 16:26]
to consider to even understand why the

[16:24 - 16:27]
method we're going to teach you is so

[16:26 - 16:30]
powerful.

[16:27 - 16:31]
Okay, so the context of what's going on

[16:30 - 16:34]
in AI right

[16:31 - 16:36]
now. Second is the master prompt method.

[16:34 - 16:39]
We wanted to really teach you something

[16:36 - 16:40]
during this this workshop like have you

[16:39 - 16:43]
come away with something that you can

[16:40 - 16:45]
immediately put to use. Uh and so we

[16:43 - 16:47]
chose one of the most powerful uh

[16:45 - 16:50]
techniques that we're going to teach in

[16:47 - 16:51]
the bigger program. Uh third, we're

[16:50 - 16:54]
going to tell you about the bigger

[16:51 - 16:56]
program that that master prompt method

[16:54 - 16:58]
uh fits into. and then we're going to

[16:56 - 17:02]
tell you how to join if you decide that

[16:58 - 17:05]
it's something that you want to invest

[17:02 - 17:08]
in. All right, so let's talk a little

[17:05 - 17:11]
bit about the

[17:08 - 17:12]
context. So those of you who have been

[17:11 - 17:15]
following me for a while know that I am

[17:12 - 17:17]
a huge fan of history. Uh you always

[17:15 - 17:19]
need to understand what has recently

[17:17 - 17:21]
happened to understand what is about to

[17:19 - 17:22]
happen.

[17:21 - 17:26]
And we sort of like been through these

[17:22 - 17:29]
three era eras in just a a decade or

[17:26 - 17:33]
two. So for for a long time note-taking

[17:29 - 17:36]
was just on paper or in folders or in

[17:33 - 17:39]
filing cabinets. It was extremely slow.

[17:36 - 17:41]
It was extremely painstaking. It was

[17:39 - 17:44]
time inensive. Uh and even when you put

[17:41 - 17:47]
in all that time and all that effort, uh

[17:44 - 17:49]
it wasn't searchable, wasn't flexible,

[17:47 - 17:51]
you couldn't really copy it easily from

[17:49 - 17:53]
one place to another. you couldn't

[17:51 - 17:56]
access it easily. That was like the the

[17:53 - 18:00]
ancient history of note-taking that

[17:56 - 18:03]
ended around 2007 with the launch of the

[18:00 - 18:05]
iPhone. This second one in the middle

[18:03 - 18:08]
was the digital notetaking era, roughly

[18:05 - 18:12]
from the start of smartphones to a few

[18:08 - 18:13]
years ago. And this is where my my work

[18:12 - 18:16]
has focused on digital note-taking and

[18:13 - 18:19]
personal knowledge management.

[18:16 - 18:21]
And you know, this this second era was a

[18:19 - 18:24]
revolution. Like it's hard to remember

[18:21 - 18:26]
now, but it was it was such a leap

[18:24 - 18:28]
forward for it to be partially

[18:26 - 18:29]
automated. For example, when you took a

[18:28 - 18:31]
highlight in one place, it appeared

[18:29 - 18:33]
somewhere else. It was much more

[18:31 - 18:35]
streamlined. It was indexed and

[18:33 - 18:37]
searchable for the first time. It was

[18:35 - 18:39]
mobile

[18:37 - 18:42]
friendly. Right? Like if you follow the

[18:39 - 18:44]
my building a second brain work, we have

[18:42 - 18:47]
spent years studying and improving and

[18:44 - 18:52]
optimizing this digital note-taking

[18:47 - 18:54]
era. Um but that era is now over, right?

[18:52 - 18:56]
It's it's really over in many ways. I

[18:54 - 18:58]
mean it continues. Note-taking is still

[18:56 - 19:00]
around. We still have a need to take

[18:58 - 19:02]
notes to kind of capture the information

[19:00 - 19:05]
in the first place. But I really think

[19:02 - 19:08]
that we're in this new era of AI first

[19:05 - 19:08]
organizations.

[19:09 - 19:14]
Okay. So that means a couple things. It

[19:12 - 19:17]
has a couple big

[19:14 - 19:18]
implications. Um the first is that so

[19:17 - 19:21]
much of that manual effort is just no

[19:18 - 19:24]
longer needed. The manual capturing a

[19:21 - 19:27]
lot of it not needed. The organizing,

[19:24 - 19:29]
the distilling, the summarizing, it's

[19:27 - 19:32]
largely not

[19:29 - 19:36]
necessary. Uh it can be done for you

[19:32 - 19:38]
either uh in whole or in part.

[19:36 - 19:39]
uh and I think a lot of people kind of

[19:38 - 19:41]
get that implication. They're kind of

[19:39 - 19:43]
aware of that. But the second one is is

[19:41 - 19:47]
kind of surprising or has been

[19:43 - 19:51]
surprising even to me which is in the

[19:47 - 19:54]
preAI era note-taking was 100% personal.

[19:51 - 19:56]
It was just you. It was you and your

[19:54 - 19:59]
personal interests, your personal

[19:56 - 20:02]
idiosyncratic, you know, goals and

[19:59 - 20:04]
projects. It was all just about you and

[20:02 - 20:07]
no one else, right? It was it was all

[20:04 - 20:10]
about creating your own personal

[20:07 - 20:13]
system. But the thing with an AI first

[20:10 - 20:15]
second brain, if you use AI AI to create

[20:13 - 20:17]
it, is once you've created it, it's so

[20:15 - 20:20]
easy to share with other

[20:17 - 20:22]
people, right? Like once you put in the

[20:20 - 20:24]
work to create an AI second

[20:22 - 20:26]
brain, there's no reason to keep that

[20:24 - 20:28]
for yourself. It can be easily shared

[20:26 - 20:30]
with a colleague, with your spouse, with

[20:28 - 20:33]
a team, across the whole organization.

[20:30 - 20:36]
So it's almost like with AI knowledge

[20:33 - 20:40]
management becomes

[20:36 - 20:42]
uh automatically social. It becomes you

[20:40 - 20:44]
know naturally a group effort and not

[20:42 - 20:46]
something that you just do completely on

[20:44 - 20:46]
your

[20:49 - 20:55]
own. All right. So this is where I want

[20:53 - 20:57]
to I want to bring in Hayden's

[20:55 - 21:02]
perspective a little as

[20:57 - 21:04]
well which is how AI is uh is changing

[21:02 - 21:06]
is transforming businesses. So Hayden

[21:04 - 21:10]
you and I have talked about this a lot.

[21:06 - 21:12]
Uh you have a lot of uh fantastic just

[21:10 - 21:14]
stories and examples and case studies

[21:12 - 21:16]
but I'd love if you just shared some of

[21:14 - 21:18]
those examples like across all the

[21:16 - 21:21]
organizations that you see. How do you

[21:18 - 21:25]
see AI changing this this AI revolution

[21:21 - 21:25]
changing business?

[21:25 - 21:33]
So AI is kind of it's the ultimate

[21:29 - 21:35]
democratizer of intelligence and

[21:33 - 21:37]
execution and I think everyone sort of

[21:35 - 21:40]
understands the intelligence piece right

[21:37 - 21:43]
now but the execution piece doesn't

[21:40 - 21:46]
necessarily it hasn't come to be yet but

[21:43 - 21:48]
it will it will and so I think AI will

[21:46 - 21:52]
ultimately remove execution as an

[21:48 - 21:55]
advantage in business right um which

[21:52 - 21:58]
means an AI first company in every

[21:55 - 21:59]
single industry will deliver let's say

[21:58 - 22:01]
you provide a service they'll deliver

[21:59 - 22:05]
the service faster better and cheaper

[22:01 - 22:07]
than a nonAI first business and if you

[22:05 - 22:11]
look at sort of standard technology

[22:07 - 22:13]
adoption curves um I would say depending

[22:11 - 22:13]
on your industry you have probably

[22:13 - 22:17]
somewhere

[22:13 - 22:19]
between one and five years before that

[22:17 - 22:20]
is true and I say depending on your

[22:19 - 22:25]
industry because obviously certain

[22:20 - 22:26]
industries like marketing software, um,

[22:25 - 22:28]
finance are a little bit more

[22:26 - 22:30]
progressive and I'd say that you're

[22:28 - 22:31]
probably closer to the one-year in other

[22:30 - 22:35]
industries that are more brick and

[22:31 - 22:36]
mortar, um, are probably closer to the

[22:35 - 22:39]
5-year.

[22:36 - 22:40]
Um, so I kind of look at this for people

[22:39 - 22:42]
who own businesses and for all of my

[22:40 - 22:44]
businesses as an actually it's an

[22:42 - 22:47]
existential risk, right? But it's also

[22:44 - 22:48]
an opportunity because the reality,

[22:47 - 22:50]
we'll get into this a little bit later,

[22:48 - 22:52]
but you know, my goal in my companies

[22:50 - 22:54]
and for my leadership teams was always,

[22:52 - 22:56]
you know, sustainable growth was maybe

[22:54 - 22:59]
30 to 40% year-over-year growth to the

[22:56 - 23:00]
bottom line. With AI, that's no longer

[22:59 - 23:04]
the case. Like sustainable growth can

[23:00 - 23:08]
now be 3 to five times growth per year,

[23:04 - 23:10]
right? So literally 10 times higher. And

[23:08 - 23:15]
I fir I firmly believe that even one to

[23:10 - 23:17]
two years of execution today AI first is

[23:15 - 23:18]
enough to actually build a moat to

[23:17 - 23:23]
protect your business going forward.

[23:18 - 23:23]
We'll we'll get into that further.

[23:27 - 23:31]
I think you muted too. Sorry. Yeah, I'm

[23:29 - 23:33]
back. So you kind of see and you you

[23:31 - 23:35]
mentioned to me that this window of

[23:33 - 23:36]
opportunity that you said is is how long

[23:35 - 23:39]
approximately before this really becomes

[23:36 - 23:40]
mainstream.

[23:39 - 23:42]
It depends. I mean I would I would

[23:40 - 23:44]
predict

[23:42 - 23:45]
um on the indust like depends on the

[23:44 - 23:47]
industry like if you're a marketing

[23:45 - 23:51]
agency you know I think you you have a

[23:47 - 23:52]
year um right? Uh but I think if you you

[23:51 - 23:54]
know I buy a lot of sort of

[23:52 - 23:56]
brickandmortar recession resilient

[23:54 - 23:59]
businesses HVAC plumbing roofing and

[23:56 - 24:02]
stuff and I think probably there that's

[23:59 - 24:04]
likely you know five plus years and I

[24:02 - 24:08]
would also say that

[24:04 - 24:11]
the the cost of not being AI first is a

[24:08 - 24:14]
little less because you are still um

[24:11 - 24:16]
limited by actual physical people um

[24:14 - 24:18]
going to somebody's home or property and

[24:16 - 24:20]
doing the work right and that will

[24:18 - 24:23]
eventually be replaced by robotics but

[24:20 - 24:26]
that's probably you know a decade and a

[24:23 - 24:29]
half away.

[24:26 - 24:33]
All right. Okay. So that's just the p

[24:29 - 24:38]
the the context step. Okay. The context

[24:33 - 24:38]
stage. So let's get into

[24:41 - 24:48]
uh a question I have for you for you all

[24:46 - 24:50]
which is your perspective on this. I'd

[24:48 - 24:51]
love to know. I mean many of you are

[24:50 - 24:53]
working in

[24:51 - 24:56]
businesses or organizations of some

[24:53 - 24:59]
kind. What is one shift or trend or

[24:56 - 25:02]
pivot or some kind of impact that you're

[24:59 - 25:06]
seeing in your industry because of

[25:02 - 25:08]
AI? Could be quote unquote positive or

[25:06 - 25:09]
negative. Could be something that you

[25:08 - 25:11]
like or you don't like. Could be

[25:09 - 25:13]
something that's growing your

[25:11 - 25:15]
organization or shrinking it. But I'd

[25:13 - 25:19]
love to hear from

[25:15 - 25:19]
you what you're

[25:19 - 25:27]
seeing. Alex sees no

[25:22 - 25:30]
coding. Susan is using AI to summarize

[25:27 - 25:33]
research. Graham is seeing the quality

[25:30 - 25:35]
of code go down quite rapidly. It's

[25:33 - 25:37]
interesting. Jen is seeing faster

[25:35 - 25:38]
product innovation. Cheating. I'm

[25:37 - 25:41]
assuming that means cheating on school

[25:38 - 25:42]
work. uh more it's more difficult to

[25:41 - 25:46]
find work as a

[25:42 - 25:47]
copywriter fing products faster focusing

[25:46 - 25:50]
on patients instead of

[25:47 - 25:52]
documentation so I can I can just kind

[25:50 - 25:55]
of see the whole diversity of different

[25:52 - 25:58]
fields and industries represented here

[25:55 - 26:00]
uh Donna is pivoting 100% to using AI

[25:58 - 26:02]
for sales

[26:00 - 26:03]
enablement Jason is using it for

[26:02 - 26:07]
complaints management increase

[26:03 - 26:10]
creativity confusion summarization

[26:07 - 26:11]
faster research all right So, I just

[26:10 - 26:14]
wanted to be sure. But what I'm seeing

[26:11 - 26:16]
here is that you all are experiencing

[26:14 - 26:18]
and seeing the AI revolution the same as

[26:16 - 26:21]
we

[26:18 - 26:22]
are. All right. Okay. So, let's talk

[26:21 - 26:25]
about the master prompt

[26:22 - 26:29]
method.

[26:25 - 26:30]
Um, let's just get into it. So, let me

[26:29 - 26:34]
give you

[26:30 - 26:37]
the upfront the one sentence definition.

[26:34 - 26:41]
Okay. The master prompt method is kind

[26:37 - 26:45]
of simple in many ways. It's an approach

[26:41 - 26:48]
to using AI, all AI that is providing

[26:45 - 26:51]
all the context about you, your

[26:48 - 26:54]
organization, your offerings, all the

[26:51 - 26:57]
context that the AI that you're

[26:54 - 27:00]
interacting with needs to understand you

[26:57 - 27:03]
and to know who you are and your

[27:00 - 27:05]
background and needs that context to

[27:03 - 27:08]
make good decisions. and doing it

[27:05 - 27:12]
upfront and all at once. That's the key

[27:08 - 27:14]
part. Okay? Doing it upstream, doing it

[27:12 - 27:17]
early, doing it at the beginning so that

[27:14 - 27:20]
all the subsequent interactions with the

[27:17 - 27:24]
AI take into account all of that

[27:20 - 27:26]
context. Okay? So, I'll contrast that

[27:24 - 27:28]
with how most people a use AI, which is

[27:26 - 27:30]
they try to use fancy prompts, right?

[27:28 - 27:32]
They sit down, they have a question, and

[27:30 - 27:34]
they think, "Let me use the craziest

[27:32 - 27:36]
multi-step

[27:34 - 27:38]
you know, fancy secret prompt that I

[27:36 - 27:43]
learned about on some from some social

[27:38 - 27:45]
media guru, which is not the worst way

[27:43 - 27:47]
to interact with AI. I mean, it's better

[27:45 - 27:50]
than nothing. It's better than just just

[27:47 - 27:51]
asking a simple generic question, but it

[27:50 - 27:54]
is much more powerful to provide all

[27:51 - 27:57]
that context up front. Okay? And there's

[27:54 - 27:59]
a couple key distinctions here that I

[27:57 - 28:01]
think you need to understand uh to to to

[27:59 - 28:03]
see why that is so powerful. And then

[28:01 - 28:06]
we're going to look at really concrete

[28:03 - 28:08]
examples and case studies. Okay, the

[28:06 - 28:10]
first one is and I talked about this in

[28:08 - 28:13]
my my recent YouTube video about

[28:10 - 28:16]
notebook LM uh in case you you're

[28:13 - 28:19]
curious about that. Um but every AI has

[28:16 - 28:21]
two kinds of knowledge as general

[28:19 - 28:24]
knowledge which is what it was trained

[28:21 - 28:27]
on, right? So that's like the the

[28:24 - 28:29]
billions or trillions of data points

[28:27 - 28:31]
that an AI was trained on before it gets

[28:29 - 28:33]
released to the public.

[28:31 - 28:35]
And that's the knowledge that I think

[28:33 - 28:37]
people spend way too much time on. They

[28:35 - 28:40]
worry about oh which model do I use

[28:37 - 28:43]
which which version of the model which

[28:40 - 28:46]
you know like which product which

[28:43 - 28:48]
interface and that stuff matters but the

[28:46 - 28:50]
the reality is you don't have any

[28:48 - 28:53]
control over it right you can't see what

[28:50 - 28:55]
say chat GBT was trained on you can't

[28:53 - 28:56]
change it you can't edit it there's

[28:55 - 28:59]
nothing you can do about that all you

[28:56 - 29:02]
can do is sign up to use you know the

[28:59 - 29:05]
latest model that everyone else is

[29:02 - 29:08]
using what matters far more and what

[29:05 - 29:10]
people almost don't even realize uh is a

[29:08 - 29:13]
thing is contextual knowledge right

[29:10 - 29:15]
think about does the AI model that you

[29:13 - 29:17]
are working with know about you the

[29:15 - 29:19]
history of your career the history of

[29:17 - 29:21]
your organization does it know your core

[29:19 - 29:24]
values does it know your org chart does

[29:21 - 29:26]
it know the products you offer does it

[29:24 - 29:29]
know your approach to customer service

[29:26 - 29:32]
all that context is absolutely what

[29:29 - 29:34]
makes the biggest difference in your

[29:32 - 29:37]
ability to get value from AI

[29:34 - 29:39]
Now, all right. And the second

[29:37 - 29:42]
distinction, which Hayden introduced me

[29:39 - 29:43]
to, and the examples he's going to show

[29:42 - 29:46]
here in a minute are great examples of

[29:43 - 29:48]
this. I think most people are really

[29:46 - 29:50]
overly focused on operational

[29:48 - 29:54]
initiatives. They're trying to make

[29:50 - 29:56]
little kind of uh process improvements,

[29:54 - 29:59]
you know, become a little more efficient

[29:56 - 30:02]
at checking email, make their Zoom

[29:59 - 30:03]
meetings a little more uh efficient, uh

[30:02 - 30:05]
become, you know, slightly more

[30:03 - 30:07]
productive with their calendar. And, you

[30:05 - 30:08]
know, I'm into that stuff. I love the

[30:07 - 30:11]
latest productivity app the same as

[30:08 - 30:13]
everyone else. But where AI is really

[30:11 - 30:17]
most powerful is in transformational

[30:13 - 30:19]
initiatives. It's in like leveling up

[30:17 - 30:21]
your organization from one level to

[30:19 - 30:24]
another. Increasing growth by double or

[30:21 - 30:27]
even triple digits. Uh cutting a team in

[30:24 - 30:31]
half while doubling its output. Those

[30:27 - 30:35]
sort of like before and after uh like

[30:31 - 30:35]
paradigm shift

[30:35 - 30:40]
initiatives. All right. So Hayden, I'll

[30:38 - 30:43]
turn it over to you. Um, and I'd love

[30:40 - 30:45]
for you, you know, you've been using the

[30:43 - 30:47]
master prompt method in multiple

[30:45 - 30:48]
businesses for a while now. What are

[30:47 - 30:51]
some of the things that it makes

[30:48 - 30:51]
possible?

[30:51 - 30:55]
Yeah, it's I saw someone in the chat

[30:54 - 30:58]
here basic basically say you're like

[30:55 - 31:01]
dumping your second brain into AI. Um,

[30:58 - 31:03]
that's absolutely true.

[31:01 - 31:07]
Um, but you're also sharing it with

[31:03 - 31:09]
everyone on your team. Um, so when I

[31:07 - 31:12]
first started playing with chat GPT,

[31:09 - 31:14]
when chat GPT became useful to me

[31:12 - 31:16]
outside of, you know, just being a

[31:14 - 31:18]
little gimmicky and a bit better than

[31:16 - 31:21]
Google, um, was when it started when

[31:18 - 31:23]
they implemented memories, right? Uh,

[31:21 - 31:25]
because those memories slowly gave you

[31:23 - 31:26]
context. And I remember when I was first

[31:25 - 31:27]
playing with it, I'd be like, remember

[31:26 - 31:29]
this, remember this, remember this. And

[31:27 - 31:32]
I was kind of building up through its

[31:29 - 31:36]
memories, which were kind of limited.

[31:32 - 31:38]
um I guess a second brain, right? And

[31:36 - 31:41]
then I found that there are other tools

[31:38 - 31:43]
uh that you can kind of just put all

[31:41 - 31:44]
those memories in um and that you can

[31:43 - 31:47]
also share with others. And that was

[31:44 - 31:51]
really the the transformational moment.

[31:47 - 31:53]
So, you know, I I like imagining sort

[31:51 - 31:55]
of, you know, we we often will have to

[31:53 - 31:57]
go and like hire a um a director

[31:55 - 31:59]
position, which by the way, like one of

[31:57 - 32:02]
the takeaways of this whole thing, those

[31:59 - 32:05]
are just going to disappear, right? Um

[32:02 - 32:07]
but imagine you need to hire a 250k a

[32:05 - 32:10]
year marketing director in your

[32:07 - 32:12]
business, right? And I, you know,

[32:10 - 32:14]
perhaps the marketing function of the

[32:12 - 32:16]
organization's been kind of ignored

[32:14 - 32:19]
because you're you're a small business.

[32:16 - 32:22]
Um, you haven't put your time into it.

[32:19 - 32:23]
Um, so okay, you need to come up with a

[32:22 - 32:25]
plan. It's going to take a couple weeks

[32:23 - 32:27]
to onboard that person, right? Fully

[32:25 - 32:29]
understand everything about your

[32:27 - 32:32]
business, their co-workers, you know,

[32:29 - 32:33]
how we do business. And then it might

[32:32 - 32:35]
take another couple weeks for them to

[32:33 - 32:37]
actually come up with a marketing plan,

[32:35 - 32:39]
right?

[32:37 - 32:41]
Um whereas with AI, you can actually do

[32:39 - 32:43]
all of that with a master prompt in

[32:41 - 32:47]
under 10 seconds. Like literally under

[32:43 - 32:50]
10 seconds and and we can show examples

[32:47 - 32:52]
of that. Um but to me, this is like

[32:50 - 32:56]
that's just a massive fundamental

[32:52 - 32:58]
change. One of the uh demos that I think

[32:56 - 33:00]
I showed you Thiago when we first met

[32:58 - 33:03]
and you asked me how I was using AI um

[33:00 - 33:06]
was something very basic, right? which

[33:03 - 33:11]
was basically like how do I use AI um

[33:06 - 33:14]
for like recruiting and hire, right? Um

[33:11 - 33:18]
and you know if you let me let

[33:14 - 33:18]
me share my screen

[33:18 - 33:25]
here. So like here here's a an empty

[33:22 - 33:28]
cloud account, right? And you know if

[33:25 - 33:31]
you ask like I need to hire Can you see

[33:28 - 33:34]
my screen by the way?

[33:31 - 33:37]
Yes. Yeah.

[33:34 - 33:39]
Um, this is like how I'd say most people

[33:37 - 33:41]
kind of start with AI, right? They start

[33:39 - 33:43]
with a very simple prompt like this,

[33:41 - 33:46]
right? And they get something back

[33:43 - 33:48]
that's pretty generic, right? Doesn't

[33:46 - 33:50]
really know anything about your company,

[33:48 - 33:52]
doesn't really know anything at all. So,

[33:50 - 33:54]
I would have to go back and forth here,

[33:52 - 33:56]
right? This is no no better than really

[33:54 - 33:58]
googling marketing director job

[33:56 - 34:01]
description and then copying and pasting

[33:58 - 34:03]
something right?

[34:01 - 34:04]
So, here's an

[34:03 - 34:08]
example

[34:04 - 34:08]
on one of my company's

[34:10 - 34:13]
accounts for the same

[34:15 - 34:20]
thing. And so, part of I'll share my

[34:17 - 34:23]
master prompt here in a second, but part

[34:20 - 34:25]
of the master prompt is I I say AI

[34:23 - 34:29]
hiring and it knows exactly what to do

[34:25 - 34:29]
with that, right?

[34:29 - 34:33]
And it's got an instruction to basically

[34:31 - 34:33]
come

[34:34 - 34:37]
back. Let you read

[34:40 - 34:46]
this. Okay. So, basically it says um I'm

[34:44 - 34:48]
going to ask you five questions one at a

[34:46 - 34:50]
time and I'm going to answer based on

[34:48 - 34:51]
what I already know about the company.

[34:50 - 34:52]
And so the first question is what are

[34:51 - 34:54]
the primary responsibilities you

[34:52 - 34:56]
envision for the marketing director?

[34:54 - 34:57]
Based on what I know, they would oversee

[34:56 - 34:58]
all marketing initiatives for both

[34:57 - 35:01]
acquire and potentially this other

[34:58 - 35:03]
company focus on lead generation for the

[35:01 - 35:06]
accelerator program. Both of our

[35:03 - 35:08]
programs um here's the team that they

[35:06 - 35:10]
would manage.

[35:08 - 35:13]
Uh they need to optimize current

[35:10 - 35:14]
channels. Okay. Yeah. So that's right.

[35:13 - 35:17]
So I just have it ask me in case

[35:14 - 35:17]
something's

[35:17 - 35:22]
off. It asks about what specific

[35:20 - 35:24]
marketing metrics and KPIs should this

[35:22 - 35:25]
be accountable for?

[35:24 - 35:28]
So qualified leads generate setting

[35:25 - 35:30]
calls and demos cost per lead currently

[35:28 - 35:31]
130 per show call conversion rates

[35:30 - 35:35]
through the funnel supporting sales

[35:31 - 35:35]
targets you know. Yeah that's

[35:40 - 35:47]
right

[35:42 - 35:50]
budget and how it's allocated and goals.

[35:47 - 35:50]
Yeah, this is all correct.

[35:56 - 36:00]
This is the team. I just want to I want

[35:59 - 36:05]
to point out like are you guys noticing

[36:00 - 36:09]
the level of detail? It's not making up

[36:05 - 36:12]
generic generic things to just fill out

[36:09 - 36:14]
a massive document. It's naming specific

[36:12 - 36:16]
people in specific positions. It knows

[36:14 - 36:18]
how many leads they need. It knows

[36:16 - 36:22]
conversion rates. knows so much about

[36:18 - 36:22]
the organization that it's hiring

[36:23 - 36:26]
for and you've gone Hayden you've gone

[36:25 - 36:29]
through you've gone through this process

[36:26 - 36:31]
in detail and confirmed that everything

[36:29 - 36:33]
really is correct doesn't just like seem

[36:31 - 36:36]
correct

[36:33 - 36:41]
is 100% correct yeah

[36:36 - 36:41]
um yeah it knows our core values

[36:41 - 36:45]
um knows what our nice to haves are

[36:44 - 36:47]
right it's like understanding M&A and

[36:45 - 36:51]
business acquisition is a nice to not a

[36:47 - 36:51]
must have. Yeah.

[36:51 - 36:57]
So based on this, it now is going out

[36:55 - 36:59]
and creating separate artifacts. I think

[36:57 - 37:01]
it's going to create like five different

[36:59 - 37:04]
they're called artifacts in cloud which

[37:01 - 37:06]
are basically like documents. Um so one

[37:04 - 37:10]
of them is a job description. that job

[37:06 - 37:13]
description is tied into we use um top

[37:10 - 37:16]
grading and top grading is a pretty it's

[37:13 - 37:18]
a pretty sophisticated like hiring um

[37:16 - 37:20]
and measurement methodology

[37:18 - 37:25]
uh it's something that's takes a lot of

[37:20 - 37:26]
work or used to and before AI um so

[37:25 - 37:31]
basically what that means is we have

[37:26 - 37:33]
like all of the responsibilities here

[37:31 - 37:34]
um it's got the metric to measure and

[37:33 - 37:38]
our quarterly target for every

[37:34 - 37:39]
responsibility it shows those what's my

[37:38 - 37:41]
month one, month two, and month three

[37:39 - 37:43]
and beyond outcomes for this person in

[37:41 - 37:45]
this role. What does a player

[37:43 - 37:48]
performance look like for each of the

[37:45 - 37:50]
major responsibilities? And what does

[37:48 - 37:52]
what's sort of an ideal background and

[37:50 - 37:53]
experience? It came out with the

[37:52 - 37:54]
compensation. Obviously, I'm going to

[37:53 - 37:59]
review this.

[37:54 - 38:02]
Um, and yeah, so that's the job

[37:59 - 38:07]
description. It then creates a screening

[38:02 - 38:07]
rubric and recruitment materials.

[38:07 - 38:15]
um which is basically we through a cover

[38:12 - 38:17]
letter it will analyze um all of the

[38:15 - 38:19]
most important sort of screening rubrics

[38:17 - 38:22]
score them and help us on the screening

[38:19 - 38:24]
side so that our HR director um you know

[38:22 - 38:28]
only talks with people above a certain

[38:24 - 38:31]
score right um it also created an email

[38:28 - 38:34]
for my list if I wanted just to um hire

[38:31 - 38:37]
from our list and it created a job

[38:34 - 38:40]
posting for an external site.

[38:37 - 38:42]
Um, it created for the actual manager.

[38:40 - 38:44]
So, our our we usually have in this case

[38:42 - 38:46]
we probably have, you know, three

[38:44 - 38:48]
different people interviewing for

[38:46 - 38:50]
director, but it creates actual live

[38:48 - 38:52]
case studies that we can do for the

[38:50 - 38:53]
working interview. It gives us three

[38:52 - 38:56]
different

[38:53 - 38:58]
options. Um, it creates take-h homework,

[38:56 - 39:02]
which I would always do for a manager,

[38:58 - 39:04]
knowledge worker, or director.

[39:02 - 39:06]
Um, it creates the meeting structures

[39:04 - 39:10]
and agendas for every single meeting

[39:06 - 39:15]
that this role would be in

[39:10 - 39:16]
um with everyone actual people. Um, and

[39:15 - 39:18]
it also creates the independent

[39:16 - 39:22]
contractor agreement because in this

[39:18 - 39:26]
case it would probably be not a W2. Um,

[39:22 - 39:26]
so all of this with

[39:26 - 39:33]
literally I typed like 10 words.

[39:30 - 39:35]
think I typed nine words here and then

[39:33 - 39:39]
yes a few times. And so that that's just

[39:35 - 39:41]
one example in one function on how like

[39:39 - 39:44]
a master prompt combined with an

[39:41 - 39:46]
operating system um can be quite not

[39:44 - 39:50]
only does it save you a lot of time but

[39:46 - 39:52]
it allows you to do like significantly

[39:50 - 39:55]
more than you're most likely currently

[39:52 - 39:57]
doing. Um which which is quite

[39:55 - 39:59]
transformational.

[39:57 - 40:01]
And you mentioned to me, what does this

[39:59 - 40:04]
do to the timeline for like what would

[40:01 - 40:06]
it take to do this in a normal timeline

[40:04 - 40:08]
to go from the realizing you need to

[40:06 - 40:09]
hire for this position to having the

[40:08 - 40:11]
person in place and onboarded and

[40:09 - 40:14]
everything versus what the timeline

[40:11 - 40:17]
looks like with AI.

[40:14 - 40:21]
So like if I I was doing this uh you

[40:17 - 40:26]
know six months ago manually um and we

[40:21 - 40:28]
had an HR department uh with two people

[40:26 - 40:32]
uh and it would this this thing here

[40:28 - 40:34]
would take probably two people two weeks

[40:32 - 40:36]
I'd say.

[40:34 - 40:38]
Um, now we have a little bit of a custom

[40:36 - 40:41]
setup on like how the screening works as

[40:38 - 40:43]
well. And that probably also saves an

[40:41 - 40:45]
additional depending on how many people

[40:43 - 40:49]
we're hiring at once, it could save an

[40:45 - 40:49]
additional couple weeks uh a month.

[40:49 - 40:55]
Um, but yeah, this right here replaced

[40:52 - 40:58]
two weeks of work for two people. So,

[40:55 - 41:00]
two people for two weeks versus

[40:58 - 41:03]
interacting with an AI for minutes. And

[41:00 - 41:04]
how how close to this like is this

[41:03 - 41:06]
literally something you could just copy

[41:04 - 41:09]
and paste right onto your website or how

[41:06 - 41:11]
close is it to being ready to go live?

[41:09 - 41:17]
Yeah, I would the thing I would look at

[41:11 - 41:20]
most um would be probably the actual um

[41:17 - 41:22]
metrics here like the quarterly targets.

[41:20 - 41:24]
This is the place that I would probably

[41:22 - 41:27]
spend maybe 15 minutes just making sure

[41:24 - 41:29]
that they're absolutely correct. Outside

[41:27 - 41:30]
of that, I basically don't even look

[41:29 - 41:32]
anymore because I know it's going to be

[41:30 - 41:35]
accurate. Um, so that's the one area I

[41:32 - 41:38]
pay a bit more attention to. Maybe the

[41:35 - 41:38]
meeting side, too. I'll look at that.

[41:40 - 41:48]
Um yeah, but I I would

[41:44 - 41:50]
say I I can't I can't even I would say

[41:48 - 41:52]
just this thing has probably

[41:50 - 41:55]
saved you know people on my team

[41:52 - 41:58]
probably years of work in the last 3

[41:55 - 42:00]
months. Um, and probably even me, like

[41:58 - 42:02]
that's the other thing is like even

[42:00 - 42:04]
though even though you might have like

[42:02 - 42:05]
an HR person like filling all this stuff

[42:04 - 42:08]
out and preparing everything, like you

[42:05 - 42:10]
also need that person to go and talk to

[42:08 - 42:12]
you about, hey, what is this person's

[42:10 - 42:13]
KPIs? What is this person's like good

[42:12 - 42:14]
outcomes? What is an A player look?

[42:13 - 42:17]
Because they don't know, right? Like how

[42:14 - 42:19]
could they know? And so it's also

[42:17 - 42:21]
probably saved, you know, whoever is

[42:19 - 42:24]
that operational person like the the

[42:21 - 42:26]
director in that department. um that's

[42:24 - 42:30]
probably also saved them like you know

[42:26 - 42:30]
four or five meetings per person.

[42:30 - 42:36]
And what's what's the bigger So there's

[42:32 - 42:39]
time savings, cost savings, but like

[42:36 - 42:42]
like what does it do to an organization

[42:39 - 42:45]
when this kind of time savings? You're

[42:42 - 42:47]
talking about like 99% plus time savings

[42:45 - 42:49]
gets multiplied across every role, every

[42:47 - 42:51]
team, every function. like what is the

[42:49 - 42:54]
the high level strategic

[42:51 - 42:55]
impact? I mean that that's why I said,

[42:54 - 42:58]
you know, I think it's actually accurate

[42:55 - 43:02]
to to be able to move at 10 times the

[42:58 - 43:03]
speed, right? So my my goals, you know,

[43:02 - 43:09]
in the beginning of

[43:03 - 43:12]
2024 for my companies um for

[43:09 - 43:14]
2026. So I'll usually look up to two

[43:12 - 43:16]
years in advance. But I was reviewing

[43:14 - 43:17]
this on a few different companies and at

[43:16 - 43:20]
the beginning of 2024 before I was

[43:17 - 43:24]
really using AI heavily. Um, I'd set the

[43:20 - 43:27]
goals for 2025, 2026. Um,

[43:24 - 43:29]
and they are now the beginning of 2025,

[43:27 - 43:33]
the 2026 goals are 10x

[43:29 - 43:36]
higher. So, it is a 10xing a year type

[43:33 - 43:39]
of or 3xing a year, 10xing over maybe

[43:36 - 43:42]
two to three years um type of

[43:39 - 43:44]
initiative. I think the big difference

[43:42 - 43:45]
though isn't that because most people

[43:44 - 43:49]
wouldn't put like this type of effort

[43:45 - 43:50]
like GM does this, right? GM does top

[43:49 - 43:53]
grading. They kind of became famous for

[43:50 - 43:55]
it and most small businesses can't do it

[43:53 - 43:57]
because it's just so much work and like

[43:55 - 44:00]
I overinvested in it for the company

[43:57 - 44:02]
size before to do it because I knew how

[44:00 - 44:03]
important it was, right? I knew how

[44:02 - 44:06]
important it is to hire slowly and fire

[44:03 - 44:09]
fast, right? That's you you learn that

[44:06 - 44:12]
quickly. Um, but what this means is now

[44:09 - 44:14]
everybody can do it, right?

[44:12 - 44:16]
And to me that's that's transformational

[44:14 - 44:20]
because I think everyone on this call

[44:16 - 44:23]
who has ever hired you know an A player

[44:20 - 44:25]
before knows that that person like can

[44:23 - 44:28]
trans they can transform your business

[44:25 - 44:31]
right um they are better than you at

[44:28 - 44:35]
what they're doing um and it's you know

[44:31 - 44:38]
one a player is worth sometimes 10 20

[44:35 - 44:41]
you know average contributors.

[44:38 - 44:44]
Absolutely. So yeah. Yeah. Could you

[44:41 - 44:48]
show could you show so I want to see one

[44:44 - 44:49]
more example in a completely different

[44:48 - 44:51]
uh domain which is operations and

[44:49 - 44:53]
workflows. Could you show that example

[44:51 - 44:55]
and then I want to show people what your

[44:53 - 44:57]
master prompt actually looks like

[44:55 - 45:00]
because that is what allows you to do

[44:57 - 45:04]
what you just did so fast.

[45:00 - 45:07]
Yep. Um so part of the sort of operating

[45:04 - 45:08]
system we have here is we create

[45:07 - 45:10]
fulfillment engines which are basically

[45:08 - 45:12]
flowcharts for process. Right. Again,

[45:10 - 45:14]
this is the type of thing that's like a

[45:12 - 45:17]
best practice for for larger companies.

[45:14 - 45:21]
Um, but it's something that we try to do

[45:17 - 45:24]
pretty early, right? Um, and this is

[45:21 - 45:26]
another example on like AI can expose

[45:24 - 45:30]
this level of organization

[45:26 - 45:33]
um, discipline, consistency um, to

[45:30 - 45:36]
businesses with one employee, right? Um,

[45:33 - 45:37]
so this is basically on on the same

[45:36 - 45:40]
company. This is an example fulfillment

[45:37 - 45:42]
engine for um basically a process that

[45:40 - 45:45]
helps uh bring

[45:42 - 45:47]
someone through onboarding all the way

[45:45 - 45:50]
to um helping them get a signed letter

[45:47 - 45:51]
of intent to buy a business, right? Um

[45:50 - 45:56]
so I'm just going

[45:51 - 45:56]
to screenshot a piece of

[46:02 - 46:06]
this. Let's go here.

[46:08 - 46:11]
I'll go back to cloud

[46:13 - 46:18]
here. And so most AI you can just copy

[46:16 - 46:19]
and paste the screenshot in. So I just

[46:18 - 46:20]
did that and I'm just going to ask it

[46:19 - 46:23]
just want to make sure it understands

[46:20 - 46:23]
what what this

[46:33 - 46:39]
is. So it's com it's it's analyzing the

[46:36 - 46:42]
image and then pulling in the the the

[46:39 - 46:46]
the context from your master prompt.

[46:42 - 46:48]
Yep. Um and it's Yeah. So left side

[46:46 - 46:50]
shows a 7-day onboarding process. It

[46:48 - 46:53]
begins when 75K is received. Includes

[46:50 - 46:54]
steps like blah blah blah. Right size

[46:53 - 46:55]
illustrates the deal sourcing evaluation

[46:54 - 46:57]
workflow with various roles involved.

[46:55 - 46:59]
Here are the roles. There are decision

[46:57 - 47:02]
points like offmarket review with past

[46:59 - 47:05]
good fit and bad fit outcomes. Um yep

[47:02 - 47:05]
totally right.

[47:06 - 47:11]
So I'm just going to say do AISAP for

[47:09 - 47:13]
every

[47:11 - 47:15]
step. And again as part of the master

[47:13 - 47:18]
prompt is actually really only

[47:15 - 47:21]
like a couple paragraphs. I I say what

[47:18 - 47:25]
AI SAP is which again is part of it sort

[47:21 - 47:25]
of understanding our operating system.

[47:27 - 47:31]
So it's now going and creating SOPs for

[47:29 - 47:33]
each step in the flowchart um in the

[47:31 - 47:35]
style that you know we like to have. So

[47:33 - 47:37]
like objective, begin, end, stakeholder

[47:35 - 47:39]
involved, explanation of each step, um

[47:37 - 47:41]
the checklist for each

[47:39 - 47:43]
step. And so that's the first one. This

[47:41 - 47:44]
is the second one. And it's going to

[47:43 - 47:47]
keep on going until all of them in that

[47:44 - 47:50]
screenshot are done. You know, for for

[47:47 - 47:53]
some context, I probably we built this

[47:50 - 47:57]
in this company about a year and a half

[47:53 - 47:59]
ago. Um, it took

[47:57 - 48:02]
us

[47:59 - 48:04]
probably six months to do this. Just

[48:02 - 48:07]
this just this step. We have a bunch

[48:04 - 48:08]
like a lot of these in every company.

[48:07 - 48:10]
Um, but just this one took us about six

[48:08 - 48:12]
months to do. And you can see like each

[48:10 - 48:14]
one of these actually links to um an

[48:12 - 48:16]
SOP. We include this in all our

[48:14 - 48:17]
onboarding, right? So that everyone

[48:16 - 48:19]
understands the entire process and what

[48:17 - 48:21]
part of the process, you know, they're

[48:19 - 48:22]
involved in, right? And it goes kind of

[48:21 - 48:25]
all the way to the point of an LOI being

[48:22 - 48:25]
signed.

[48:26 - 48:32]
And this is we can now do this in it's

[48:30 - 48:34]
really just waiting, right? I just need

[48:32 - 48:35]
to wait for it to finish all of them. Um

[48:34 - 48:38]
and then I'll go and screenshot the next

[48:35 - 48:41]
part of it. It'll do those. So overall,

[48:38 - 48:43]
it's maybe like 30 minutes now to do

[48:41 - 48:45]
something that took six months. And

[48:43 - 48:48]
they're good. They're they're super

[48:45 - 48:52]
accurate. Um, I would still review them,

[48:48 - 48:54]
but they are better than the version

[48:52 - 48:56]
that was originally created that I also

[48:54 - 49:00]
had to review before like significantly

[48:56 - 49:00]
better. Um,

[49:01 - 49:05]
so those that six months it would have

[49:02 - 49:08]
taken before that that's six months by

[49:05 - 49:13]
how many people?

[49:08 - 49:14]
I six months primarily by probably two

[49:13 - 49:18]
people. So it would have been we have a

[49:14 - 49:23]
process person. Um and actually my

[49:18 - 49:26]
daughter I showed her this and she cried

[49:23 - 49:29]
cried from from

[49:26 - 49:31]
she's like job anymore. No I said no you

[49:29 - 49:35]
just have to you have to use

[49:31 - 49:37]
it. Um so she was the person who who who

[49:35 - 49:39]
did this. Um and then she worked with

[49:37 - 49:40]
the managers. Um and so it was mainly

[49:39 - 49:43]
one other person who kind of managed

[49:40 - 49:46]
this entire uh fulfillment engine.

[49:43 - 49:48]
Um, but it was a full six months from

[49:46 - 49:51]
her and probably like, you know, at

[49:48 - 49:53]
least a day a week from from whoever was

[49:51 - 49:53]
owning each

[49:54 - 50:00]
SOP. Yeah, this is I hope you guys are

[49:57 - 50:03]
seeing what I'm seeing. Like, do you all

[50:00 - 50:05]
get how transformational it is to take

[50:03 - 50:09]
six month initiatives and turn them into

[50:05 - 50:12]
30 minute ones? That isn't a that isn't

[50:09 - 50:16]
a marginal small change. that that

[50:12 - 50:18]
starts to uh completely change the

[50:16 - 50:20]
structure of your business, what is even

[50:18 - 50:21]
possible in your business, the markets

[50:20 - 50:23]
you can serve. You know what really

[50:21 - 50:26]
strikes me about this, Hayden, which I

[50:23 - 50:29]
hadn't realized before, is both of these

[50:26 - 50:31]
examples, hiring a like a manager

[50:29 - 50:34]
executive position and documenting a

[50:31 - 50:37]
process. Uh it's it's kind of like AI is

[50:34 - 50:39]
collapsing a lot of the difference the

[50:37 - 50:41]
gap between large companies and small

[50:39 - 50:44]
companies you know like our tiny company

[50:41 - 50:47]
of five people. One of the main reasons

[50:44 - 50:48]
I don't hire people humans is because it

[50:47 - 50:51]
takes us months and months and months

[50:48 - 50:53]
and so much bandwidth that we it's like

[50:51 - 50:55]
a it's like too big of a risk for us. We

[50:53 - 50:57]
can't afford to set aside all the time

[50:55 - 50:58]
it takes to do it really thoroughly and

[50:57 - 51:01]
to do it well. And so we just don't do

[50:58 - 51:03]
it. And so now we can hire at the same

[51:01 - 51:06]
level of sophistication

[51:03 - 51:08]
uh as a large

[51:06 - 51:11]
organization. That's what I mean by the

[51:08 - 51:14]
democratization of execution, right? Is

[51:11 - 51:16]
like this level of you know we we call

[51:14 - 51:18]
this like best practices, right? But

[51:16 - 51:19]
this level of best practice has

[51:18 - 51:21]
typically been reserved for companies

[51:19 - 51:24]
that were you know probably around 10

[51:21 - 51:27]
million revenue and up, right?

[51:24 - 51:28]
um you maybe one to two million EBIT and

[51:27 - 51:32]
up

[51:28 - 51:33]
like and now it's open anymore, right?

[51:32 - 51:35]
And so like a you hear a lot of people

[51:33 - 51:36]
talking about oh the one person billion

[51:35 - 51:39]
dollar companies maybe we're not there

[51:36 - 51:40]
yet but we are definitely at the you

[51:39 - 51:45]
know one

[51:40 - 51:47]
person $10 million companies right um or

[51:45 - 51:49]
or the three person you know hundred

[51:47 - 51:52]
million companies 100% we're already

[51:49 - 51:55]
there right

[51:52 - 51:57]
and and so so you know we used to when

[51:55 - 52:00]
we bought businesses right we had a like

[51:57 - 52:02]
an integration program after we bought a

[52:00 - 52:04]
business and So um the integration

[52:02 - 52:06]
program was basically it was there to

[52:04 - 52:07]
kind of mitigate like the transition

[52:06 - 52:09]
risk between the seller and the new

[52:07 - 52:13]
owner but was also there to set up a

[52:09 - 52:15]
leadership team and um you know the goal

[52:13 - 52:17]
it was like usually a sixmonth uh

[52:15 - 52:19]
integration um change management program

[52:17 - 52:21]
we did and the we would tell people hey

[52:19 - 52:23]
the goal of this is we would say this is

[52:21 - 52:25]
what good looks like in all of these

[52:23 - 52:28]
different areas in a business right and

[52:25 - 52:29]
we'd say the goal of this is to build up

[52:28 - 52:31]
a leadership team that understands what

[52:29 - 52:32]
good looks like like we would set up

[52:31 - 52:35]
tours of other businesses that were

[52:32 - 52:37]
already there, right? Maybe 3 to 5 years

[52:35 - 52:40]
ahead of them.

[52:37 - 52:44]
Um but also to understand the work you

[52:40 - 52:46]
need to do over the next 3 to four years

[52:44 - 52:48]
to implement these best practices.

[52:46 - 52:52]
Right? That was the expectation we set

[52:48 - 52:55]
today. You can implement them all in if

[52:52 - 52:58]
you were really working on it in under a

[52:55 - 53:01]
year in six months easily. So like my

[52:58 - 53:03]
new approach to buying a business is

[53:01 - 53:05]
totally changed, right? It's not like

[53:03 - 53:07]
let's set up a leadership team to let's

[53:05 - 53:09]
you know figure this out so that we can

[53:07 - 53:10]
get to this level of good in four years.

[53:09 - 53:12]
It's like let's just do it like we have

[53:10 - 53:15]
six months. Let's do it.

[53:12 - 53:16]
Yeah, it's incredible. Could you show

[53:15 - 53:18]
the just briefly scroll through the

[53:16 - 53:20]
master prompt?

[53:18 - 53:23]
So again, this is just one of the

[53:20 - 53:25]
techniques we're going to teach out of

[53:23 - 53:27]
many others in the second brain

[53:25 - 53:30]
enterprise program, but I just want to

[53:27 - 53:32]
have you just see a a brief look at at

[53:30 - 53:34]
how it's

[53:32 - 53:35]
structured. So I I share this master

[53:34 - 53:37]
prompt with everyone in the company. Um

[53:35 - 53:38]
and it's part of the onboarding. They

[53:37 - 53:40]
learn how to use it. This this part at

[53:38 - 53:42]
the top here, we usually have this in a

[53:40 - 53:44]
Google doc. Uh this part at the top is

[53:42 - 53:46]
customized to each person. So in this

[53:44 - 53:48]
case, um it's doing it for me in this

[53:46 - 53:51]
role right?

[53:48 - 53:54]
Um it understands all of our like our

[53:51 - 53:58]
structure information, our product

[53:54 - 54:00]
information, our goals and targets. Um

[53:58 - 54:03]
you know that that was for one product,

[54:00 - 54:06]
that's for another product.

[54:03 - 54:06]
Um

[54:07 - 54:12]
understands our salesunnel and

[54:09 - 54:14]
conversion metrics, our sales process.

[54:12 - 54:17]
Um you know, what kind of conversion

[54:14 - 54:20]
rates do we hit, how long does it take?

[54:17 - 54:22]
Um, yeah, our teams, right? So, these

[54:20 - 54:24]
are each of our teams, our fixed costs

[54:22 - 54:27]
for each team. So, I can at any point it

[54:24 - 54:29]
acts as my CFO or my controller. If I

[54:27 - 54:31]
needed to say to just say, "Hey, how are

[54:29 - 54:33]
we doing? We got this many sales." Like,

[54:31 - 54:35]
I can do cash flow management just back

[54:33 - 54:38]
and forth instead of looking at Google

[54:35 - 54:38]
Sheets.

[54:40 - 54:48]
Um, this is probably about like 20 pages

[54:44 - 54:49]
in a Google doc. 22 pages. Um, and what

[54:48 - 54:50]
we've done is we've set it up in such a

[54:49 - 54:52]
way where you just kind of go through a

[54:50 - 54:54]
couple questionnaires and it spits out

[54:52 - 54:58]
the master prompt done for you.

[54:54 - 54:58]
Yeah. So,

[55:00 - 55:04]
so you have a 20page master prompt and

[55:03 - 55:06]
you said there's like a company one and

[55:04 - 55:10]
then each person has their own version

[55:06 - 55:12]
of it and that is is what it allows

[55:10 - 55:14]
those interactions that you showed us to

[55:12 - 55:16]
be so high quality and so and so

[55:14 - 55:18]
precise.

[55:16 - 55:20]
Yep. Yeah. And it's just this is out of

[55:18 - 55:22]
the box, right? This is just Claude Pro,

[55:20 - 55:25]
right? There's no code, nothing at all.

[55:22 - 55:26]
Like anyone can do this. You can do

[55:25 - 55:28]
this, you know, even if you don't have a

[55:26 - 55:30]
business, you can exactly do this like

[55:28 - 55:33]
for your second brain. So, this is some

[55:30 - 55:36]
inspiration for you to to take from it.

[55:33 - 55:38]
Um, and if you do that or if you're

[55:36 - 55:39]
involved in like a role in a business,

[55:38 - 55:41]
you there's like a section at the top

[55:39 - 55:42]
that basically says, you know, what's

[55:41 - 55:44]
your role? What do you want to get out

[55:42 - 55:46]
of AI? uh what are your strengths? What

[55:44 - 55:48]
are your weaknesses? Right? And so I

[55:46 - 55:51]
think I've got that at the top of mine

[55:48 - 55:54]
here. I just say like, you

[55:51 - 55:55]
know, my my strengths are visionary,

[55:54 - 55:58]
product learning self-discipline

[55:55 - 55:59]
problem solving, and my weaknesses are

[55:58 - 56:00]
like driving accountability, keeping

[55:59 - 56:02]
everything on schedule, internal

[56:00 - 56:04]
communication, doing things I don't like

[56:02 - 56:08]
doing.

[56:04 - 56:11]
Um and so it understands that.

[56:08 - 56:13]
Yeah. Yeah. So, okay, I want to move on

[56:11 - 56:17]
here, but I hope you

[56:13 - 56:19]
guys are sort of seeing the potential of

[56:17 - 56:22]
all this.

[56:19 - 56:25]
Um, so there's another piece to

[56:22 - 56:27]
understanding this which I'll share here

[56:25 - 56:30]
on the screen, which is the empower

[56:27 - 56:34]
operating system. So, the master prompt

[56:30 - 56:36]
method is like one technique, one tool,

[56:34 - 56:37]
but it's not it's not the end- all

[56:36 - 56:40]
beall. It's just it's like one

[56:37 - 56:42]
technique. there's a a whole broader

[56:40 - 56:44]
framework that you've been developing

[56:42 - 56:46]
for years and years and you use across

[56:44 - 56:48]
all your companies that's called empower

[56:46 - 56:50]
uh which the master prompt fits into but

[56:48 - 56:53]
it kind of provides essentially a

[56:50 - 56:56]
holistic way of managing and building

[56:53 - 56:58]
and scaling a business um and this is

[56:56 - 57:00]
essentially how the curriculum of our

[56:58 - 57:02]
program will be structured. We're going

[57:00 - 57:04]
to spend one 90-minute live session on

[57:02 - 57:06]
each of these seven pillars and then

[57:04 - 57:08]
another three live another three

[57:06 - 57:11]
90-minute live sessions on the

[57:08 - 57:12]
introduction and conclusion. Okay. So,

[57:11 - 57:14]
we're not going to get super into this,

[57:12 - 57:18]
but could you say a few words, Hayden,

[57:14 - 57:21]
on kind of what empower is and why it's

[57:18 - 57:25]
and how it's proven?

[57:21 - 57:27]
Yeah. Uh, so empower is the name of one

[57:25 - 57:30]
of my companies as well. Um basically

[57:27 - 57:32]
these are the seven I call them value

[57:30 - 57:36]
drivers um that apply to every business.

[57:32 - 57:40]
And so you know what we just saw um is

[57:36 - 57:41]
part of you know actually both ease um

[57:40 - 57:44]
so the expansion capability and

[57:41 - 57:48]
execution systems um and

[57:44 - 57:50]
basically the way this originated is

[57:48 - 57:51]
because I have a because I have a

[57:50 - 57:53]
business that helps people buy

[57:51 - 57:55]
businesses. It actually originated as a

[57:53 - 57:57]
way to come up with like the intrinsic

[57:55 - 57:59]
value of businesses that we were

[57:57 - 58:01]
assessing

[57:59 - 58:05]
and in that space you know businesses

[58:01 - 58:07]
are kind of the pricing of businesses is

[58:05 - 58:09]
very unsophisticated and so we wanted to

[58:07 - 58:10]
create a much more sophisticated version

[58:09 - 58:13]
of seeing if a business was you know

[58:10 - 58:16]
fairly priced or not. Um it then later

[58:13 - 58:18]
kind of expanded as we bought businesses

[58:16 - 58:21]
in also understanding um what are the

[58:18 - 58:23]
areas that you could focus on you know

[58:21 - 58:26]
apply leverage to in order to actually

[58:23 - 58:28]
um expand the overall value of the

[58:26 - 58:30]
business right so if you wanted to sell

[58:28 - 58:32]
it if you wanted to raise money uh and

[58:30 - 58:33]
buy another business um how could you

[58:32 - 58:36]
what what was the best way to spend

[58:33 - 58:38]
resources right your time and and your

[58:36 - 58:41]
cash um and so we we separated into

[58:38 - 58:43]
these seven value drivers um and we

[58:41 - 58:45]
created some tools tools to kind of

[58:43 - 58:48]
assess our businesses and kind of give

[58:45 - 58:50]
us a score in each of them um and help

[58:48 - 58:52]
us figure out what what we need to

[58:50 - 58:55]
prioritize, right? Because that's really

[58:52 - 58:57]
all strategy is is just deciding to work

[58:55 - 59:01]
on one thing and saying no to everything

[58:57 - 59:04]
else. Um and so these are yeah that's

[59:01 - 59:07]
these are the seven areas. Um what our

[59:04 - 59:09]
program does now is it shows you how to

[59:07 - 59:12]
a how much is your business worth today?

[59:09 - 59:17]
Um B, how do you score in each of these

[59:12 - 59:19]
areas? Um C, what is the area that you

[59:17 - 59:23]
need to that has the highest leverage

[59:19 - 59:25]
that you should invest in? And D, how do

[59:23 - 59:27]
you apply AI to do

[59:25 - 59:29]
that? So I think this is so huge because

[59:27 - 59:31]
it's, you know, there's this funny

[59:29 - 59:33]
question which is like how do you know

[59:31 - 59:36]
if you've successfully applied AI in a

[59:33 - 59:39]
business? If you think about it, it's

[59:36 - 59:42]
not it's not just that it feels like it.

[59:39 - 59:43]
Like it's not that you see PE, you know,

[59:42 - 59:45]
chat GPT on people's screens when you

[59:43 - 59:48]
look over their shoulder. It's not even

[59:45 - 59:50]
really that you save time because how do

[59:48 - 59:52]
you know the thing that the the the the

[59:50 - 59:54]
task that you're saving time in is

[59:52 - 59:56]
inherently valuable. What I love about

[59:54 - 59:59]
this is it takes the perspective that

[59:56 - 01:00:02]
the true test of whether you

[59:59 - 01:00:04]
successfully applied AI is the valuation

[01:00:02 - 01:00:07]
of the whole enterprise is higher like

[01:00:04 - 01:00:10]
it's higher to third-party buyers like

[01:00:07 - 01:00:12]
disinterested outside people looking

[01:00:10 - 01:00:14]
from the outside in and saying yeah you

[01:00:12 - 01:00:17]
have more automation you're more

[01:00:14 - 01:00:20]
efficient you have higher margins you

[01:00:17 - 01:00:23]
have higher return on assets like

[01:00:20 - 01:00:25]
there's no more objective measure of a

[01:00:23 - 01:00:27]
of an organization's improvement than

[01:00:25 - 01:00:29]
its than its

[01:00:27 - 01:00:33]
valuation.

[01:00:29 - 01:00:36]
Right? Okay. So, I'd love to hear from

[01:00:33 - 01:00:38]
you. Now, we've sort of touched on a

[01:00:36 - 01:00:42]
couple in-depth

[01:00:38 - 01:00:45]
uh demos, tried to sort of mention at

[01:00:42 - 01:00:47]
least a variety of different parts of a

[01:00:45 - 01:00:49]
business or even kinds of businesses

[01:00:47 - 01:00:51]
that this could be applied in. But I'd

[01:00:49 - 01:00:54]
love to see in the chat what do you take

[01:00:51 - 01:00:55]
away from this? What's the area of your

[01:00:54 - 01:00:57]
business? You could say a specific role.

[01:00:55 - 01:01:00]
You could say a function. You could say

[01:00:57 - 01:01:02]
an ongoing activity. You could say a

[01:01:00 - 01:01:06]
specific product. However you break down

[01:01:02 - 01:01:06]
and visualize your

[01:01:08 - 01:01:16]
business. Yeah. So blog posts and

[01:01:12 - 01:01:18]
content creation, sales for sure. Uh

[01:01:16 - 01:01:21]
strategy. Anuk says strategy positioning

[01:01:18 - 01:01:25]
and market analysis absolutely fantastic

[01:01:21 - 01:01:27]
use case. Uh Ryan says his email list.

[01:01:25 - 01:01:30]
Gabriel says code reviews and pair

[01:01:27 - 01:01:30]
programming.

[01:01:30 - 01:01:34]
Absolutely. Client avatar analysis.

[01:01:32 - 01:01:36]
That's we've been using it for that.

[01:01:34 - 01:01:38]
It's fantastic. Customer service and

[01:01:36 - 01:01:40]
success decision

[01:01:38 - 01:01:42]
making. I really don't think there is a

[01:01:40 - 01:01:46]
function or a kind of business that

[01:01:42 - 01:01:46]
cannot apply this honestly.

[01:01:48 - 01:01:52]
Okay.

[01:01:50 - 01:01:54]
So, I think we've said a little bit

[01:01:52 - 01:01:56]
about this, but is there anything you'd

[01:01:54 - 01:01:59]
like to add um Hayden about what's at

[01:01:56 - 01:02:01]
stake here? What what what are people's

[01:01:59 - 01:02:03]
options? Like what are the what's the

[01:02:01 - 01:02:05]
fork in the road that they're that

[01:02:03 - 01:02:08]
they're facing with AI with AI right

[01:02:05 - 01:02:08]
now?

[01:02:09 - 01:02:15]
Yeah, it's kind of what I said before.

[01:02:12 - 01:02:18]
It's depending on your industry. It'll

[01:02:15 - 01:02:20]
happen. The question is when, right? But

[01:02:18 - 01:02:23]
someone AI first

[01:02:20 - 01:02:24]
will will just solve execution, right?

[01:02:23 - 01:02:28]
They'll do it faster, they'll do it

[01:02:24 - 01:02:31]
cheaper, and they'll do it better. Um,

[01:02:28 - 01:02:33]
and that is going to eventually drive

[01:02:31 - 01:02:35]
costs down to the end users massively

[01:02:33 - 01:02:37]
and destroy margins. Like that's just

[01:02:35 - 01:02:41]
that's the nature of, you know, of

[01:02:37 - 01:02:46]
deflationary technology, right?

[01:02:41 - 01:02:47]
Um that being said I think if you are

[01:02:46 - 01:02:50]
the first person to do that and if you

[01:02:47 - 01:02:54]
design it in such a way that you are

[01:02:50 - 01:02:56]
creating a moat that protects the

[01:02:54 - 01:02:58]
company long term right and I think

[01:02:56 - 01:02:59]
you've talked in the past about you know

[01:02:58 - 01:03:02]
what does

[01:02:59 - 01:03:05]
a what is the moat long term right it's

[01:03:02 - 01:03:08]
community its data right its network

[01:03:05 - 01:03:11]
effects I believe that there is a chance

[01:03:08 - 01:03:14]
to become a market leader

[01:03:11 - 01:03:16]
insanely fast by using AI and and to

[01:03:14 - 01:03:19]
protect your business from that sort of

[01:03:16 - 01:03:19]
margin erosion.

[01:03:21 - 01:03:25]
Yeah, I think I think that's it. Very

[01:03:24 - 01:03:27]
well

[01:03:25 - 01:03:32]
put.

[01:03:27 - 01:03:32]
Um actually want to do a poll now.

[01:03:34 - 01:03:38]
You should see a little window pop up on

[01:03:35 - 01:03:40]
your screen that says that asks a

[01:03:38 - 01:03:41]
question which is how concerned are you

[01:03:40 - 01:03:43]
about your business falling behind due

[01:03:41 - 01:03:46]
to competitors using

[01:03:43 - 01:03:47]
AI? And I I'd honestly just really like

[01:03:46 - 01:03:50]
to know. I'm pretty concerned about my

[01:03:47 - 01:03:52]
business to be honest. I think much or

[01:03:50 - 01:03:55]
most of content creation in the future

[01:03:52 - 01:03:58]
is going to be done by AI. But how about

[01:03:55 - 01:03:58]
you?

[01:04:08 - 01:04:14]
Okay, when it hits 500 responses, I'm

[01:04:11 - 01:04:14]
going to end the

[01:04:23 - 01:04:28]
poll.

[01:04:25 - 01:04:30]
Okay, here's what you responded. 26% of

[01:04:28 - 01:04:34]
you are extremely concerned, 38%

[01:04:30 - 01:04:37]
somewhat concerned, 18% neutral, 3% not

[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]
concerned. I would love to know uh your

[01:04:37 - 01:04:42]
stress reduction

[01:04:38 - 01:04:46]
techniques and 15% already

[01:04:42 - 01:04:49]
ahead. Okay, makes sense. Pretty pretty

[01:04:46 - 01:04:52]
reasonable distribution. Okay, so we

[01:04:49 - 01:04:53]
didn't want to just spell doom and gloom

[01:04:52 - 01:04:56]
for everyone. We want to actually

[01:04:53 - 01:04:59]
provide a solution. And this is the

[01:04:56 - 01:05:02]
program uh the educational and training

[01:04:59 - 01:05:06]
program that we have created to give you

[01:05:02 - 01:05:08]
the absolute best possible

[01:05:06 - 01:05:11]
um tools and techniques and frameworks

[01:05:08 - 01:05:14]
and strategies to not just survive all

[01:05:11 - 01:05:16]
these enormous changes that we are we're

[01:05:14 - 01:05:18]
facing and already experiencing but to

[01:05:16 - 01:05:22]
actually uh come away with it as an

[01:05:18 - 01:05:24]
opportunity to come out of it better.

[01:05:22 - 01:05:28]
So, just the basics, uh, it's a live

[01:05:24 - 01:05:29]
cohort. Um, you may, many of you have

[01:05:28 - 01:05:32]
probably taken my building a second

[01:05:29 - 01:05:33]
brain cohorts in the past. We did 19 of

[01:05:32 - 01:05:36]
them. It's something we've been doing

[01:05:33 - 01:05:38]
for many years. Um, this is the biggest

[01:05:36 - 01:05:40]
longest cohort we've ever done because

[01:05:38 - 01:05:43]
there there is a lot to cover. Uh, so

[01:05:40 - 01:05:46]
we're going to be doing 10 live sessions

[01:05:43 - 01:05:48]
over three weeks. So, it's a sprint. We

[01:05:46 - 01:05:51]
chose to do it short and intense rather

[01:05:48 - 01:05:53]
than long and not so intense uh largely

[01:05:51 - 01:05:56]
because it's changing so much like the

[01:05:53 - 01:05:59]
field of AI will be different uh one

[01:05:56 - 01:06:02]
month later versus the beginning of that

[01:05:59 - 01:06:03]
month. Okay. uh and that's and that's

[01:06:02 - 01:06:06]
alongside dedicated peers which is one

[01:06:03 - 01:06:08]
of the the things I found and and many

[01:06:06 - 01:06:09]
people have found is one of the best

[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]
ways to learn is not just from a single

[01:06:09 - 01:06:14]
instructor or in this case two

[01:06:11 - 01:06:16]
instructors but to be able to look right

[01:06:14 - 01:06:18]
and left and see all these other uh

[01:06:16 - 01:06:21]
business owners and executives and

[01:06:18 - 01:06:24]
leaders who are just as dedicated as you

[01:06:21 - 01:06:25]
who are are passionate who are committed

[01:06:24 - 01:06:27]
who are accountable and holding you

[01:06:25 - 01:06:32]
accountable. It's really why we love

[01:06:27 - 01:06:35]
that that kind of social cohort learning

[01:06:32 - 01:06:37]
experience. Um, second, this is uh a

[01:06:35 - 01:06:40]
chance to get our direct

[01:06:37 - 01:06:42]
support. Um, you're going to get both of

[01:06:40 - 01:06:44]
us are going to be on every single call.

[01:06:42 - 01:06:46]
Of course, you're going to get not just

[01:06:44 - 01:06:49]
our instruction, but our guidance, our

[01:06:46 - 01:06:51]
coaching, our dos and don'ts. We've made

[01:06:49 - 01:06:54]
some big mistakes, wasted a lot of time,

[01:06:51 - 01:06:56]
some a lot of trial and error that we're

[01:06:54 - 01:06:58]
going to try to save you from.

[01:06:56 - 01:07:00]
Um, and this is this is the first and

[01:06:58 - 01:07:03]
possibly only time that we're going to

[01:07:00 - 01:07:04]
do a live cohort. Uh, we may do another

[01:07:03 - 01:07:07]
one again, probably not anytime soon.

[01:07:04 - 01:07:08]
Maybe like next year or something. Uh,

[01:07:07 - 01:07:10]
this is not something we're going to be

[01:07:08 - 01:07:12]
doing ongoingly for a long time. This

[01:07:10 - 01:07:15]
might be your one chance to go through

[01:07:12 - 01:07:17]
the program uh, in real time with us.

[01:07:15 - 01:07:19]
Uh, and you'll receive lifetime access

[01:07:17 - 01:07:21]
not only to the recordings, all the

[01:07:19 - 01:07:22]
materials, everything to do with this

[01:07:21 - 01:07:27]
this first cohort, which is really a

[01:07:22 - 01:07:29]
beta cohort, plus you'll also get access

[01:07:27 - 01:07:31]
automatic access to whatever the next

[01:07:29 - 01:07:34]
iteration looks like. We don't know what

[01:07:31 - 01:07:36]
that what that is exactly. Uh, it

[01:07:34 - 01:07:38]
depends a lot on what we what we learn

[01:07:36 - 01:07:41]
from this cohort. But whatever is V2 of

[01:07:38 - 01:07:43]
this or I guess V the full V1, you will

[01:07:41 - 01:07:45]
also get access

[01:07:43 - 01:07:47]
to. All right.

[01:07:45 - 01:07:51]
Um, do you want to say a little bit

[01:07:47 - 01:07:53]
about uh, so this is sort of some of the

[01:07:51 - 01:07:55]
main takeaways or outcomes that you'll

[01:07:53 - 01:07:56]
uh that you'll take away from the

[01:07:55 - 01:08:00]
curriculum. Uh, is there anything you

[01:07:56 - 01:08:02]
want to say about about these Hayden?

[01:08:00 - 01:08:05]
Yeah, I obviously you'll learn the

[01:08:02 - 01:08:08]
master prompt. Um, so I think everyone

[01:08:05 - 01:08:10]
after this should go and play with uh,

[01:08:08 - 01:08:11]
you know, Claude or Notebook LM and try

[01:08:10 - 01:08:13]
to put together their own master prompt

[01:08:11 - 01:08:15]
anyway. Um, but we have a bunch of sort

[01:08:13 - 01:08:18]
of custom software tools we've done to

[01:08:15 - 01:08:20]
kind of facilitate this and make sure uh

[01:08:18 - 01:08:23]
it doesn't take you forever and uh

[01:08:20 - 01:08:25]
nothing is neglected. Um, as Thiago

[01:08:23 - 01:08:29]
mentioned, we're going to have a session

[01:08:25 - 01:08:30]
around each of those value drivers. Um,

[01:08:29 - 01:08:32]
and so we'll actually help you kind of

[01:08:30 - 01:08:35]
score where you're at with each of those

[01:08:32 - 01:08:36]
value drivers. Um, and you know, how

[01:08:35 - 01:08:39]
that kind of also contributes to the

[01:08:36 - 01:08:40]
value of your business. Um, and then

[01:08:39 - 01:08:42]
we're also going to teach you how to use

[01:08:40 - 01:08:45]
AI and how we've used AI in each of

[01:08:42 - 01:08:47]
those value drivers. So, um, for

[01:08:45 - 01:08:49]
example, and some of it may even be

[01:08:47 - 01:08:51]
using thirdparty tools, right? So, for

[01:08:49 - 01:08:54]
example, I've replaced over a million

[01:08:51 - 01:08:57]
dollars of ad spend in sort of various

[01:08:54 - 01:08:58]
versions of AI tools that, you know, set

[01:08:57 - 01:09:02]
thousands of calls for us. We're going

[01:08:58 - 01:09:02]
to teach exactly how we did that.

[01:09:03 - 01:09:08]
Um, and then the the last piece of it is

[01:09:06 - 01:09:10]
is understanding. So once you know kind

[01:09:08 - 01:09:12]
of your score in each of these areas

[01:09:10 - 01:09:13]
once you understand how to use AI the

[01:09:12 - 01:09:15]
last piece of this which is quite

[01:09:13 - 01:09:17]
important is understanding like what the

[01:09:15 - 01:09:20]
next steps are and how you should spend

[01:09:17 - 01:09:23]
your time and prioritize this because

[01:09:20 - 01:09:25]
the last thing we want is um you know

[01:09:23 - 01:09:27]
everyone just being overwhelmed and

[01:09:25 - 01:09:29]
trying to work on everything at once

[01:09:27 - 01:09:32]
right um so the idea is to have like a

[01:09:29 - 01:09:37]
very clear sprint on this is how I'm

[01:09:32 - 01:09:37]
going to use AI to maximum leverage

[01:09:39 - 01:09:42]
That's right. What's so unique is we're

[01:09:41 - 01:09:44]
going to be able to actually instead of

[01:09:42 - 01:09:46]
giving you homework, okay, now go and

[01:09:44 - 01:09:49]
find all this other time to go do this

[01:09:46 - 01:09:50]
by yourself. With the speed at which AI

[01:09:49 - 01:09:53]
works, we can actually do it right there

[01:09:50 - 01:09:56]
on the call. Like try this, wait 30

[01:09:53 - 01:09:58]
seconds, see what happened, and iterate

[01:09:56 - 01:10:01]
right there in real time. It's a really

[01:09:58 - 01:10:05]
unique way of learning

[01:10:01 - 01:10:05]
this. All right.

[01:10:06 - 01:10:12]
And and here's the

[01:10:09 - 01:10:12]
cost.

[01:10:13 - 01:10:21]
$9,995 is the the investment that you're

[01:10:17 - 01:10:22]
going to make to essentially change the

[01:10:21 - 01:10:26]
trajectory of your

[01:10:22 - 01:10:28]
business. It's not an incremental, you

[01:10:26 - 01:10:31]
know, 5 10% improvement. We're talking

[01:10:28 - 01:10:35]
about, you know, multiples, multiples of

[01:10:31 - 01:10:38]
growth, multiples of speed, multiples of

[01:10:35 - 01:10:42]
of margins, of customer satisfaction.

[01:10:38 - 01:10:42]
It's why we insist on that word

[01:10:42 - 01:10:47]
transformational. Um, this is a this is

[01:10:45 - 01:10:48]
a level of investment that probably

[01:10:47 - 01:10:51]
doesn't make sense for individual

[01:10:48 - 01:10:53]
contributors. I'll just say that. Uh,

[01:10:51 - 01:10:55]
it's really designed and everything

[01:10:53 - 01:10:57]
about this program is designed for

[01:10:55 - 01:11:00]
people with teams. They can be small

[01:10:57 - 01:11:02]
teams, they can be small businesses. Uh

[01:11:00 - 01:11:05]
but it's the it's combining really the

[01:11:02 - 01:11:08]
leverage of AI with the leverage of an

[01:11:05 - 01:11:11]
organ of an organization of some type.

[01:11:08 - 01:11:12]
Combining those two together is where is

[01:11:11 - 01:11:14]
where that transformation where that

[01:11:12 - 01:11:17]
power

[01:11:14 - 01:11:19]
lies. Um and just a couple notes there.

[01:11:17 - 01:11:22]
It's by application only. Not everyone

[01:11:19 - 01:11:24]
will be accepted. Uh there's a quite

[01:11:22 - 01:11:27]
thorough application. Uh depending on

[01:11:24 - 01:11:30]
your answers to that application, you'll

[01:11:27 - 01:11:33]
be asked to or you'll be required to

[01:11:30 - 01:11:36]
schedule a call. Everyone needs a call

[01:11:33 - 01:11:38]
with a one of our admissions lead uh

[01:11:36 - 01:11:40]
leads, which is Josh and Josh or both

[01:11:38 - 01:11:42]
Josh's uh just to make sure that you're

[01:11:40 - 01:11:44]
the right fit and they're going to

[01:11:42 - 01:11:45]
really make sure that you and your

[01:11:44 - 01:11:48]
organization are the right kind of

[01:11:45 - 01:11:50]
organization to go through this. Uh and

[01:11:48 - 01:11:53]
we do have payment plans, so that is an

[01:11:50 - 01:11:56]
option as well.

[01:11:53 - 01:11:56]
and it's called the second brain

[01:11:57 - 01:12:03]
enterprise. Just a quick overview of the

[01:12:00 - 01:12:05]
timeline. So, what should you do? What

[01:12:03 - 01:12:08]
will you need to do to join us? Uh,

[01:12:05 - 01:12:11]
first apply at the link below. Uh, the

[01:12:08 - 01:12:12]
last possible date to do that is May 26,

[01:12:11 - 01:12:14]
but I encourage you to do it sooner

[01:12:12 - 01:12:17]
because we do have some pre-work, some

[01:12:14 - 01:12:20]
some preparation for you to do. Uh, as I

[01:12:17 - 01:12:22]
said, you'll be you'll be asked to

[01:12:20 - 01:12:23]
schedule a call with one of our two

[01:12:22 - 01:12:25]
admissions leads to make sure you're a

[01:12:23 - 01:12:27]
good fit. If accepted, make your payment

[01:12:25 - 01:12:29]
before the start of the cohort. And you

[01:12:27 - 01:12:31]
can do all of that at

[01:12:29 - 01:12:33]
secondbrainenterprise.com, which is the

[01:12:31 - 01:12:35]
website that also has all of the details

[01:12:33 - 01:12:37]
that we've talked about during this

[01:12:35 - 01:12:39]
workshop and many others. Everything

[01:12:37 - 01:12:42]
that you're going to need to know to

[01:12:39 - 01:12:42]
decide whether this is for

[01:12:44 - 01:12:50]
you. All right.

[01:12:47 - 01:12:50]
And now it's your

[01:12:52 - 01:13:00]
turn. Have about 15 minutes

[01:12:55 - 01:13:00]
here. So, I'm going to open up the Q&A

[01:13:02 - 01:13:06]
now and sort by most up

[01:13:09 - 01:13:14]
votes. So, some of these I can just

[01:13:11 - 01:13:15]
answer myself quickly. Um, Nikolai, no,

[01:13:14 - 01:13:18]
there will not be a handout with

[01:13:15 - 01:13:20]
instructions. Um, we're we're going to

[01:13:18 - 01:13:21]
be creating content, either a YouTube

[01:13:20 - 01:13:23]
video or a blog post or something along

[01:13:21 - 01:13:26]
those lines about the master prompt

[01:13:23 - 01:13:29]
method. Um, because I I just think it

[01:13:26 - 01:13:30]
should be it should be much more widely

[01:13:29 - 01:13:34]
known and it's something that really

[01:13:30 - 01:13:37]
anyone can use uh regardless of what AI

[01:13:34 - 01:13:38]
program they they use. So, we will be

[01:13:37 - 01:13:40]
creating content on that, but currently

[01:13:38 - 01:13:43]
don't have anything ready to share

[01:13:40 - 01:13:47]
besides the recording of this

[01:13:43 - 01:13:49]
call. Um, this is one for you, Hayden

[01:13:47 - 01:13:51]
from Andre. It took 10 words to type

[01:13:49 - 01:13:53]
your prompt for hiring a marketing

[01:13:51 - 01:13:55]
director, but how long did it take to

[01:13:53 - 01:13:57]
set up the context? How much effort did

[01:13:55 - 01:14:01]
it take to gather the content, curate

[01:13:57 - 01:14:01]
it, and set it up within Claude?

[01:14:02 - 01:14:07]
I would say it takes people about

[01:14:08 - 01:14:14]
probably about 30 to 60 minutes um to go

[01:14:11 - 01:14:16]
through everything necessary to set up

[01:14:14 - 01:14:18]
the first sort of major iterations of

[01:14:16 - 01:14:21]
the master prompt and then you're kind

[01:14:18 - 01:14:22]
of iterating um probably pretty

[01:14:21 - 01:14:25]
frequently. I still iterate the master

[01:14:22 - 01:14:28]
prompt at least once a week. Um so yeah,

[01:14:25 - 01:14:30]
probably 30 to 60 minutes one time. But

[01:14:28 - 01:14:32]
then obviously that was just one example

[01:14:30 - 01:14:36]
of I use cloud

[01:14:32 - 01:14:37]
probably 30 40 times a day.

[01:14:36 - 01:14:39]
Yeah, I think that's an important

[01:14:37 - 01:14:41]
important observation which is the

[01:14:39 - 01:14:44]
master prompt is a thing. It's a

[01:14:41 - 01:14:46]
document, but it's also a process. The

[01:14:44 - 01:14:48]
process for how to update it, for how to

[01:14:46 - 01:14:51]
propagate it within the organization,

[01:14:48 - 01:14:53]
for how to bring it into different AI

[01:14:51 - 01:14:55]
products you might use. So, it's not

[01:14:53 - 01:14:57]
it's it is a oneanddone deal, but then

[01:14:55 - 01:14:59]
it's also like something that evolves

[01:14:57 - 01:14:59]
with

[01:15:00 - 01:15:04]
you. Okay.

[01:15:05 - 01:15:10]
Um, okay. Some of these are quite a bit

[01:15:08 - 01:15:12]
out of the scope of what we're covering

[01:15:10 - 01:15:13]
on this workshop, so I'm going to skip a

[01:15:12 - 01:15:19]
couple.

[01:15:13 - 01:15:21]
Um, what's your take on agents? So, are

[01:15:19 - 01:15:23]
is AI going to become these autonomous

[01:15:21 - 01:15:25]
thinking partners that just do work on

[01:15:23 - 01:15:27]
our behalf or or what is that going to

[01:15:25 - 01:15:29]
look like?

[01:15:27 - 01:15:31]
Yeah, agents are definitely the future.

[01:15:29 - 01:15:34]
They're all the rage right now.

[01:15:31 - 01:15:37]
Um the the reality is I I don't like if

[01:15:34 - 01:15:40]
you look at sort of the adoption curve

[01:15:37 - 01:15:42]
agents in my opinion are not the thing

[01:15:40 - 01:15:45]
today the thing is really get people to

[01:15:42 - 01:15:48]
learn how to use LLMs properly and and

[01:15:45 - 01:15:50]
get people to prompt properly right so

[01:15:48 - 01:15:51]
the master prompt as a concept like if

[01:15:50 - 01:15:54]
you actually think of what you're doing

[01:15:51 - 01:15:56]
is you in every single time you type 10

[01:15:54 - 01:16:00]
words you're actually typing you know 20

[01:15:56 - 01:16:01]
pages right plus 10 words um and so the

[01:16:00 - 01:16:03]
AI's got all the context every single

[01:16:01 - 01:16:06]
time.

[01:16:03 - 01:16:10]
Um, I believe autonomous agents in

[01:16:06 - 01:16:12]
probably two years or so um will

[01:16:10 - 01:16:14]
actually be decent and won't require

[01:16:12 - 01:16:17]
like a ridiculous amount of setup. Um,

[01:16:14 - 01:16:19]
we do use them, right? So, I use agents

[01:16:17 - 01:16:21]
all over the place. Um, but it's a lot

[01:16:19 - 01:16:23]
of work. It's a lot of setup and it's

[01:16:21 - 01:16:26]
not accessible to most people today. Um,

[01:16:23 - 01:16:28]
I think that'll change in two years.

[01:16:26 - 01:16:31]
Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Let's talk about

[01:16:28 - 01:16:33]
security and privacy.

[01:16:31 - 01:16:35]
the the elephant in the room so often

[01:16:33 - 01:16:38]
when we talk about AI. Um, how do you

[01:16:35 - 01:16:40]
think about that, Hayden? Like using AI

[01:16:38 - 01:16:43]
so widely across multiple organizations.

[01:16:40 - 01:16:47]
Do you worry about security or privacy?

[01:16:43 - 01:16:50]
Do you do anything to to mitigate them?

[01:16:47 - 01:16:54]
It's so that's actually more of an agent

[01:16:50 - 01:16:58]
question is like is your

[01:16:54 - 01:17:01]
um are you exposing anything to

[01:16:58 - 01:17:04]
uh to like the are you exposing your

[01:17:01 - 01:17:09]
backend through a chatbot to

[01:17:04 - 01:17:11]
from customers right uh and so that's

[01:17:09 - 01:17:15]
more of an agent question than like a am

[01:17:11 - 01:17:17]
I working with an LLM question um and

[01:17:15 - 01:17:21]
there are ways to about that. Another

[01:17:17 - 01:17:24]
version um basically a separate agent

[01:17:21 - 01:17:26]
watching the communication that your

[01:17:24 - 01:17:27]
chatbot has with customers to ensure

[01:17:26 - 01:17:31]
that it's not doing certain things and

[01:17:27 - 01:17:34]
so you have that sort of guard rail.

[01:17:31 - 01:17:37]
Mhm. So do you do you ever think about

[01:17:34 - 01:17:41]
using either offline internet local AI

[01:17:37 - 01:17:44]
models so that you don't even so so the

[01:17:41 - 01:17:47]
public pro you know let's say whatever

[01:17:44 - 01:17:49]
it is the the product you're using that

[01:17:47 - 01:17:51]
that is publicly that is a a different

[01:17:49 - 01:17:54]
company from your own does not even see

[01:17:51 - 01:17:58]
your data at all.

[01:17:54 - 01:18:02]
Yeah. My my programmer runs um has run

[01:17:58 - 01:18:05]
Llama and Deepseek both locally. Um you

[01:18:02 - 01:18:10]
know we we run MCP.

[01:18:05 - 01:18:13]
Um the to me personally I I'm maybe it's

[01:18:10 - 01:18:17]
my personality. I'm I'm less concerned

[01:18:13 - 01:18:20]
about you know anthropic potentially

[01:18:17 - 01:18:21]
knowing details about my companies. Um

[01:18:20 - 01:18:22]
there's nothing in there like I'm

[01:18:21 - 01:18:24]
sharing this with all my employees.

[01:18:22 - 01:18:26]
nothing in there that's like not pretty

[01:18:24 - 01:18:30]
much public knowledge.

[01:18:26 - 01:18:33]
Um, so no, I'm not I'm not I'm not I

[01:18:30 - 01:18:37]
guess paranoid to that extent,

[01:18:33 - 01:18:39]
but you can't do it if you are right.

[01:18:37 - 01:18:42]
Yeah. Yeah. Me neither. Me neither. It's

[01:18:39 - 01:18:44]
like compared to what's already out

[01:18:42 - 01:18:47]
there, what has been mined and profiled

[01:18:44 - 01:18:49]
about you, you know, from all the

[01:18:47 - 01:18:51]
companies out there doing that, compared

[01:18:49 - 01:18:54]
to that, I think what we are sharing

[01:18:51 - 01:18:57]
with these LLMs is quite minor and in

[01:18:54 - 01:19:01]
most cases practically public

[01:18:57 - 01:19:02]
knowledge. Um, Romero asked, "So, you

[01:19:01 - 01:19:04]
have a digital note-taking app like

[01:19:02 - 01:19:08]
Evernote or Amplotes. Will this class

[01:19:04 - 01:19:10]
teach me how to bring content from that

[01:19:08 - 01:19:12]
into LLM models? Yes, that's one of the

[01:19:10 - 01:19:14]
things. So, I'm going to be sort of

[01:19:12 - 01:19:16]
providing a bridge from a lot of what

[01:19:14 - 01:19:18]
I've taught about personal knowledge

[01:19:16 - 01:19:20]
management, digital note-taking,

[01:19:18 - 01:19:22]
building second brains at the personal

[01:19:20 - 01:19:24]
level and bridging that. And actually,

[01:19:22 - 01:19:27]
if you've been doing any of those

[01:19:24 - 01:19:29]
things, you are so incredibly well

[01:19:27 - 01:19:31]
positioned, right? Like most people

[01:19:29 - 01:19:33]
don't even have the all this context

[01:19:31 - 01:19:35]
that we're talking about in any in any

[01:19:33 - 01:19:37]
place. So they have to produce it. They

[01:19:35 - 01:19:38]
have to generate it. They have to like

[01:19:37 - 01:19:40]
pull it out of them. If you've already

[01:19:38 - 01:19:41]
been taking notes, even if they're

[01:19:40 - 01:19:43]
messy, even if they're disorganized, if

[01:19:41 - 01:19:48]
that if those that context, those notes

[01:19:43 - 01:19:49]
even exist, you are like that's half the

[01:19:48 - 01:19:53]
battle. You're kind of already you you

[01:19:49 - 01:19:56]
have a head start in in um in taking

[01:19:53 - 01:19:56]
advantage of this approach.

[01:19:58 - 01:20:02]
Let's

[01:19:59 - 01:20:02]
see.

[01:20:03 - 01:20:07]
Um, I think we already addressed

[01:20:10 - 01:20:16]
that. Do you ever worry in in the the

[01:20:14 - 01:20:19]
responses that AI is generating? Do you

[01:20:16 - 01:20:22]
ever worry, Hayden, about bias? Any kind

[01:20:19 - 01:20:24]
of bias? Uh, bias towards, you know,

[01:20:22 - 01:20:27]
hiring only certain kinds of people?

[01:20:24 - 01:20:29]
bias like blind spots in how they make

[01:20:27 - 01:20:33]
decisions. Uh biasing themselves based

[01:20:29 - 01:20:35]
on your past like replicating mistakes

[01:20:33 - 01:20:37]
uh or biases that you had in the in the

[01:20:35 - 01:20:40]
in the history of the organization.

[01:20:37 - 01:20:40]
Anything like that?

[01:20:41 - 01:20:46]
I actually I'm gonna I guess look at

[01:20:45 - 01:20:48]
that question from two different

[01:20:46 - 01:20:50]
perspectives, right? So from one

[01:20:48 - 01:20:54]
perspective, I actually intentionally

[01:20:50 - 01:20:55]
give AI bias to counter my bias, right?

[01:20:54 - 01:20:57]
And so that's why I talk that's why I

[01:20:55 - 01:20:59]
very specifically have in my master

[01:20:57 - 01:21:02]
bonds like what do I want AI for and

[01:20:59 - 01:21:05]
what are my weaknesses, right? And I I

[01:21:02 - 01:21:08]
find a lot AI is like actually a little

[01:21:05 - 01:21:11]
bit too positive uh and and a little bit

[01:21:08 - 01:21:13]
too chipper. And sometimes I will add to

[01:21:11 - 01:21:15]
my master prompt to be like a bit more

[01:21:13 - 01:21:16]
of like a coach and a leadership coach

[01:21:15 - 01:21:22]
and like to you know call a spade a

[01:21:16 - 01:21:27]
spay, right? Um in terms of like DEI

[01:21:22 - 01:21:30]
based bias and like bigoted, right?

[01:21:27 - 01:21:32]
Um it's it's something to check for sure

[01:21:30 - 01:21:34]
and that's why when we when we set up

[01:21:32 - 01:21:36]
these initial prompts we do check to

[01:21:34 - 01:21:41]
make sure like the initial screening

[01:21:36 - 01:21:45]
works right and by by works I mean isn't

[01:21:41 - 01:21:47]
bigoted um from at least with anthropic

[01:21:45 - 01:21:51]
that wasn't the case right we had a lot

[01:21:47 - 01:21:55]
of uh you know pretty equal distribution

[01:21:51 - 01:21:59]
um across you know genders

[01:21:55 - 01:22:01]
um and racist. So, but yeah, I think

[01:21:59 - 01:22:03]
it's if if that's something that you're

[01:22:01 - 01:22:06]
concerned about, I think you put some

[01:22:03 - 01:22:09]
extra effort um into the prompts to

[01:22:06 - 01:22:13]
ensure that you overcome it.

[01:22:09 - 01:22:16]
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Same same

[01:22:13 - 01:22:20]
perspective from me.

[01:22:16 - 01:22:22]
Um so, I'm going to we have about six

[01:22:20 - 01:22:25]
minutes five minutes left. I'd love to

[01:22:22 - 01:22:27]
hear any questions about the program.

[01:22:25 - 01:22:29]
So, I'm going to sort the questions here

[01:22:27 - 01:22:32]
by most

[01:22:29 - 01:22:34]
recent. If you're someone who sees

[01:22:32 - 01:22:36]
yourself joining or at least applying

[01:22:34 - 01:22:39]
for something like the Second Brain

[01:22:36 - 01:22:41]
Enterprise, do you have any questions uh

[01:22:39 - 01:22:43]
that we can answer about

[01:22:41 - 01:22:45]
that? When you do your call with our

[01:22:43 - 01:22:47]
admissions people, you'll also have the

[01:22:45 - 01:22:48]
chance to ask them anything you want. Uh

[01:22:47 - 01:22:50]
really we're we're pretty transparent

[01:22:48 - 01:22:52]
about everything about what what the

[01:22:50 - 01:22:54]
program entails but is there anything

[01:22:52 - 01:22:57]
that we can address uh now up

[01:22:54 - 01:23:00]
front? Oh Mark's question about AI

[01:22:57 - 01:23:03]
tools. we will recommend Claud notebook

[01:23:00 - 01:23:06]
LM. Those are really the only two like

[01:23:03 - 01:23:09]
publicly available mainstream platforms

[01:23:06 - 01:23:12]
that have the key feature of getting a

[01:23:09 - 01:23:14]
project like folder or notebook with a

[01:23:12 - 01:23:17]
bunch of materials including your master

[01:23:14 - 01:23:19]
prompt and sharing it. It's kind of it's

[01:23:17 - 01:23:21]
kind of crazy. It's kind of bizarre but

[01:23:19 - 01:23:24]
you can't do that in chat GPT unless you

[01:23:21 - 01:23:27]
use the API and you know build a whole

[01:23:24 - 01:23:28]
custom solution. So for the use cases

[01:23:27 - 01:23:31]
that we are we are advocating and

[01:23:28 - 01:23:32]
teaching in the program you can't you

[01:23:31 - 01:23:36]
essentially can't use chatbt you'll need

[01:23:32 - 01:23:38]
to use either uh either claude or

[01:23:36 - 01:23:41]
notebook

[01:23:38 - 01:23:43]
lm that that's for the master prompt

[01:23:41 - 01:23:45]
side of it and I think for the sharing

[01:23:43 - 01:23:48]
with your organization side of it. Um I

[01:23:45 - 01:23:49]
do use almost every LLM and like we

[01:23:48 - 01:23:51]
probably will tell you what LLMs are

[01:23:49 - 01:23:53]
good for like chat GPT does much better

[01:23:51 - 01:23:56]
image generation it's better on voice

[01:23:53 - 01:23:58]
stuff. deep research is useful. Um it's

[01:23:56 - 01:24:02]
just for the actual master prompt part

[01:23:58 - 01:24:04]
of it. Um it it doesn't work. Um

[01:24:02 - 01:24:06]
likewise, I use Gemini for coding like

[01:24:04 - 01:24:10]
vibe coding all the time. It's probably

[01:24:06 - 01:24:12]
the best coder um in AI studio, but you

[01:24:10 - 01:24:15]
know, if they're gems just don't have a

[01:24:12 - 01:24:17]
doesn't work properly. Um that being

[01:24:15 - 01:24:19]
said, this could all change also in the

[01:24:17 - 01:24:21]
next 30 days. It could be that chatb

[01:24:19 - 01:24:22]
opens up this feature and we say, "Okay,

[01:24:21 - 01:24:24]
yeah, you can use chatb as well. There

[01:24:22 - 01:24:27]
you go.

[01:24:24 - 01:24:27]
[Music]

[01:24:30 - 01:24:36]
Yeah. Okay. I'm looking for any as our

[01:24:33 - 01:24:40]
time is ending. I'm looking for

[01:24:36 - 01:24:41]
what's that? Um Oh, I don't Gabrielle

[01:24:40 - 01:24:43]
asked that what time will the sessions

[01:24:41 - 01:24:46]
be?

[01:24:43 - 01:24:50]
Oh, yes. Uh 8 a.m. Pacific.

[01:24:46 - 01:24:51]
uh which we've found is the the 90

[01:24:50 - 01:24:53]
minutes that works for the largest

[01:24:51 - 01:24:56]
number of time zones, works for the

[01:24:53 - 01:24:58]
Americas, works for Europe, uh Asia,

[01:24:56 - 01:25:00]
it's I think it's like 11:00 p.m. or

[01:24:58 - 01:25:03]
midnight, but also is feasible. Uh that

[01:25:00 - 01:25:06]
tends to be the the ideal uh slot for

[01:25:03 - 01:25:06]
our our cohort

[01:25:07 - 01:25:13]
sessions. Oh, I guess I should switch to

[01:25:10 - 01:25:13]
the chat now.

[01:25:14 - 01:25:17]
Uh Muhammad, you can catch up via the

[01:25:15 - 01:25:20]
recording which we'll send out later

[01:25:17 - 01:25:22]
today or tomorrow. Uh no, we don't we're

[01:25:20 - 01:25:25]
not offering any discounts. No country

[01:25:22 - 01:25:27]
specific or currency specific pricing.

[01:25:25 - 01:25:30]
Uh that's that's not an option for this

[01:25:27 - 01:25:30]
beta cohort.

[01:25:44 - 01:25:49]
Okay, any last comments, Hayden?

[01:25:50 - 01:25:56]
No, just uh yeah, thanks. This was fun.

[01:25:53 - 01:25:58]
I uh I do encourage everyone regardless

[01:25:56 - 01:26:00]
as to whether they want to join in the

[01:25:58 - 01:26:02]
program, use AI regardless of your

[01:26:00 - 01:26:04]
background. I saw someone asking, "Hey,

[01:26:02 - 01:26:06]
if I'm a retiree, should I use AI?" I

[01:26:04 - 01:26:09]
have spent a lot of time

[01:26:06 - 01:26:12]
teaching both of my in-laws and my

[01:26:09 - 01:26:14]
mother to spend time with AI because it

[01:26:12 - 01:26:17]
is it

[01:26:14 - 01:26:19]
just it it makes you better at whatever

[01:26:17 - 01:26:21]
it is that you want to do. It makes you

[01:26:19 - 01:26:23]
better and it makes you better at

[01:26:21 - 01:26:26]
learning. Um which to me like that's

[01:26:23 - 01:26:28]
what life is for. Um I use it to with my

[01:26:26 - 01:26:32]
daughter learn Japanese.

[01:26:28 - 01:26:33]
Um I you know I've used it even to help

[01:26:32 - 01:26:37]
my paddle game with

[01:26:33 - 01:26:38]
Thiago. It's uh Oh, so that's your

[01:26:37 - 01:26:40]
anyone

[01:26:38 - 01:26:42]
gets if anyone gets something out of

[01:26:40 - 01:26:44]
this. My my hope is it's just start

[01:26:42 - 01:26:47]
using AI.

[01:26:44 - 01:26:49]
Yeah, you go. Absolutely. All right,

[01:26:47 - 01:26:50]
everyone. Thank you for being here. Hope

[01:26:49 - 01:26:52]
this was helpful whether or not you

[01:26:50 - 01:26:54]
decide to join us. But if you do decide

[01:26:52 - 01:26:57]
to join us, I look forward to seeing you

[01:26:54 - 01:27:00]
learning together in what I am certain

[01:26:57 - 01:27:03]
will be an intense but also very
