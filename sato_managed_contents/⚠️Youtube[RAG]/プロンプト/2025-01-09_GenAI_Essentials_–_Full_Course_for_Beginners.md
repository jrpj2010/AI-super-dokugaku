[00:00 - 00:05]
hey it's Andrew Brown and welcome to the

[00:02 - 00:07]
free generative AI Essentials course the

[00:05 - 00:08]
purpose of this course is to give you

[00:07 - 00:11]
comprehensive knowledge so that you can

[00:08 - 00:13]
go and start building generative AI

[00:11 - 00:16]
applications and in particular this is

[00:13 - 00:18]
the prerequisite course for my free gen

[00:16 - 00:21]
boot camp where we actually go out and

[00:18 - 00:23]
build real projects so I hope you're as

[00:21 - 00:25]
excited as I am and you're able to get

[00:23 - 00:27]
as as through much of this content uh so

[00:25 - 00:29]
you can go build projects with me and I

[00:27 - 00:33]
will see you soon okay

[00:29 - 00:35]
[Music]

[00:33 - 00:36]
hey everyone it's Andrew Brown and

[00:35 - 00:38]
welcome to the start of our journey

[00:36 - 00:40]
asking the most important question which

[00:38 - 00:45]
is first which is what is the

[00:40 - 00:48]
genis uh genis gen Essentials

[00:45 - 00:49]
certification so this is a practical gen

[00:48 - 00:52]
certification teaching you the

[00:49 - 00:54]
fundamental concepts of ml AI gen all

[00:52 - 00:57]
modalities of gen with a strong focus on

[00:54 - 01:00]
llms programmatically working with J

[00:57 - 01:02]
workloads uh both with cloud and local l

[01:00 - 01:05]
M and it is a cloud vendor agnostic

[01:02 - 01:07]
approach so there are other geni

[01:05 - 01:09]
certifications out there it us has one

[01:07 - 01:11]
Azure has one Nvidia has one and you

[01:09 - 01:14]
know what I've made courses for them all

[01:11 - 01:16]
and they're okay but they're very very

[01:14 - 01:19]
specific to those vendors and they leave

[01:16 - 01:20]
out huge huge gaps and they have all

[01:19 - 01:24]
these expectations of what you should

[01:20 - 01:26]
already know in order to um uh uh to

[01:24 - 01:28]
start building with Gen and so the

[01:26 - 01:30]
purpose I made this gen Essentials

[01:28 - 01:32]
course is so that you have

[01:30 - 01:36]
round uh round and Broad knowledge so

[01:32 - 01:38]
that you can be successful in any area

[01:36 - 01:40]
of gen no matter the technical choice

[01:38 - 01:42]
and to me that is super super important

[01:40 - 01:44]
I'm going to get my head out of the way

[01:42 - 01:48]
here so the course code for the exam Pro

[01:44 - 01:50]
gen Essentials is exp geni 001 I do want

[01:48 - 01:52]
to point out that this course I kind of

[01:50 - 01:54]
feel as like a beta course at this point

[01:52 - 01:57]
and so I'm hoping at some point I will

[01:54 - 01:59]
release a version 002 and include all of

[01:57 - 02:00]
the information that I want to actually

[01:59 - 02:03]
include in this course course it's still

[02:00 - 02:04]
really good comparative to other

[02:03 - 02:06]
certifications it'll definitely blow it

[02:04 - 02:08]
out of the water but I you know I just

[02:06 - 02:10]
want to say that the release of this

[02:08 - 02:11]
course will have some gaps and they will

[02:10 - 02:14]
be addressed in minor updates as we

[02:11 - 02:17]
receive feedback so pay attention to

[02:14 - 02:19]
updates or upcoming road maps um for

[02:17 - 02:20]
this content because this is not a

[02:19 - 02:22]
oneandone course we're going to have to

[02:20 - 02:24]
come back to it and continuously update

[02:22 - 02:27]
it because gen is moving very very

[02:24 - 02:29]
quickly okay but let's continue on so

[02:27 - 02:31]
who's the certification for we'll

[02:29 - 02:32]
consider the examp Pro gen Essentials if

[02:31 - 02:34]
you are preparing for the preit

[02:32 - 02:35]
knowledge to take the free gen boot camp

[02:34 - 02:38]
so you can be successful in its

[02:35 - 02:40]
completion and Grading for my boot camps

[02:38 - 02:42]
we go and we build we hit the ground

[02:40 - 02:44]
running and so my expectation is that

[02:42 - 02:46]
you can code you have General

[02:44 - 02:48]
familiarity with the stuff you have uh

[02:46 - 02:50]
knowledge under you so this thing is

[02:48 - 02:53]
going to prepare you if you do not take

[02:50 - 02:55]
this course before my free gen boot camp

[02:53 - 02:57]
you're going to be struggling a little

[02:55 - 03:00]
bit uh you can still do the free gen

[02:57 - 03:03]
boot camp but um you if you want to

[03:00 - 03:06]
maximize uh uh how much you learn please

[03:03 - 03:08]
please please go through this course um

[03:06 - 03:10]
and it's going to help you out

[03:08 - 03:12]
okay uh another reason you should

[03:10 - 03:14]
consider taking the uh exam Pro gen

[03:12 - 03:15]
Essentials if you need Broad and

[03:14 - 03:17]
practical knowledge understanding gen

[03:15 - 03:19]
Solutions so you have the technical

[03:17 - 03:22]
flexibility to move in any technical

[03:19 - 03:24]
Direction right now geni we don't know

[03:22 - 03:26]
what direction it's going do you use

[03:24 - 03:27]
cloud services do you do local local LMS

[03:26 - 03:30]
should you be fine tuning should you be

[03:27 - 03:32]
using rag um how much does it cost how

[03:30 - 03:36]
do you secure it there's so many

[03:32 - 03:39]
questions um that uh that that need to

[03:36 - 03:41]
be answered and this is my explo

[03:39 - 03:42]
exploration think of it like a CTO

[03:41 - 03:44]
trying to explore and evaluate for for

[03:42 - 03:45]
the company I'm coming back to you with

[03:44 - 03:48]
all that information so that you can

[03:45 - 03:50]
make informed decisions and have

[03:48 - 03:52]
confidence building with jny so I'm

[03:50 - 03:54]
hoping that's what I achieve throughout

[03:52 - 03:56]
this course you need to focus on

[03:54 - 03:58]
implementation deliver gen workloads

[03:56 - 03:59]
that are both secure and in budget at

[03:58 - 04:01]
the end of the day we got to build

[03:59 - 04:04]
things for people that's why we're

[04:01 - 04:06]
learning gen to apply the knowledge and

[04:04 - 04:08]
so that's what I want to do I generally

[04:06 - 04:10]
focus on implementation and development

[04:08 - 04:12]
because I have a developer background I

[04:10 - 04:14]
think it's fun building things um and so

[04:12 - 04:16]
you're going to see a lot of Hands-On in

[04:14 - 04:18]
this course whether you can do it or not

[04:16 - 04:20]
is a different story if you find that

[04:18 - 04:23]
the the Hands-On stuff is beyond your

[04:20 - 04:25]
knowledge just watch the videos and and

[04:23 - 04:27]
absorb the information you can this is

[04:25 - 04:29]
all about getting you exposure to the

[04:27 - 04:31]
the the most amount of knowledge and and

[04:29 - 04:33]
the shortest amount of time if you

[04:31 - 04:36]
cannot do the things do not stress out

[04:33 - 04:38]
about it okay uh let's continue on here

[04:36 - 04:40]
so we're looking at the Gen road map so

[04:38 - 04:41]
there's this certification course which

[04:40 - 04:44]
is going to give you confidence and

[04:41 - 04:48]
understanding talking about J and having

[04:44 - 04:50]
the tools to get started building okay

[04:48 - 04:52]
um and that is going to be based on the

[04:50 - 04:54]
exam Pro gen maturity learning model

[04:52 - 04:57]
which we'll look at in a separate video

[04:54 - 04:58]
um the followup to this gen centrals

[04:57 - 05:01]
course is the Project based boot camp

[04:58 - 05:03]
which is called the free gen boot camp

[05:01 - 05:05]
this will give you proof that you can

[05:03 - 05:07]
build gen workloads through Hands-On

[05:05 - 05:09]
projects which will be at gen. Cloud

[05:07 - 05:12]
proo bootcamp.com

[05:09 - 05:14]
register if you have yet to do so go

[05:12 - 05:16]
register now even if you don't finish

[05:14 - 05:18]
this gen essential course you can

[05:16 - 05:21]
absolutely register this is an optional

[05:18 - 05:24]
course to prepare you so it's up to you

[05:21 - 05:25]
what you want to do um but I I strongly

[05:24 - 05:27]
recommend you go through this course if

[05:25 - 05:29]
you can but still you know if you don't

[05:27 - 05:30]
have the time but you do have time for

[05:29 - 05:33]
the boot camp sign up for the boot camp

[05:30 - 05:34]
and be there um how long does it take to

[05:33 - 05:37]
study to pass this exam well we have

[05:34 - 05:39]
between 15 hours and 30 hours if you are

[05:37 - 05:41]
experienced you have some other geni

[05:39 - 05:43]
certifications you're going to have an

[05:41 - 05:44]
easy time through this but you are also

[05:43 - 05:46]
going to benefit because there's going

[05:44 - 05:48]
to be a lot of stuff that you didn't see

[05:46 - 05:50]
if you took the adabs Gen practitioner

[05:48 - 05:51]
you're going to be really surprised ads

[05:50 - 05:52]
AI practitioner you're going to be

[05:51 - 05:54]
really surprised how much stuff that we

[05:52 - 05:55]
covered that you didn't see anywhere

[05:54 - 05:57]
else same thing with the Azure AI

[05:55 - 05:59]
engineer associate you'll be really

[05:57 - 06:01]
surprised how much stuff we cover in

[05:59 - 06:02]
this that uh I could not cover in those

[06:01 - 06:03]
other ones because they're out of scope

[06:02 - 06:07]
but they're not out of scope here we're

[06:03 - 06:10]
covering all of gen in this course um so

[06:07 - 06:11]
yeah if you uh yeah so if you are

[06:10 - 06:13]
experienced 15 hours if you're a

[06:11 - 06:14]
beginner you're looking at 30 hours what

[06:13 - 06:16]
is the average study time I could not

[06:14 - 06:18]
tell you for this one because we don't

[06:16 - 06:20]
have enough data at this point but I do

[06:18 - 06:23]
feel that this is more a lecture and lab

[06:20 - 06:26]
heavy practice exams are not going to be

[06:23 - 06:28]
your main focus as the exam itself is

[06:26 - 06:29]
not difficult it's just there to

[06:28 - 06:30]
evaluate your knowledge that's why we

[06:29 - 06:32]
have

[06:30 - 06:34]
um this optional certification step I do

[06:32 - 06:36]
want to tell you that if you want to get

[06:34 - 06:38]
certified to earn this badge you do have

[06:36 - 06:40]
to pay for it uh I I don't know what the

[06:38 - 06:42]
cost is in this video but I know that

[06:40 - 06:44]
it's not a high cost to to get it if you

[06:42 - 06:46]
if you want if you are just gaining the

[06:44 - 06:48]
knowledge to take the boot camp still do

[06:46 - 06:50]
this course okay but if you want that

[06:48 - 06:54]
extra badge to to show off you can um

[06:50 - 06:55]
also do that by um paying for that that

[06:54 - 06:58]
certification uh the recommended study

[06:55 - 07:00]
time here is 1 to two hours a day for 15

[06:58 - 07:02]
days what does it take to pass exam

[07:00 - 07:04]
watch the lectures do the Hands-On lab

[07:02 - 07:06]
and again I want to point out that we

[07:04 - 07:07]
are working with so many different

[07:06 - 07:09]
Technologies there's going to be areas

[07:07 - 07:12]
where you you might not have an account

[07:09 - 07:13]
you might like okay I want to learn this

[07:12 - 07:15]
but I don't really like Azure so I'll

[07:13 - 07:16]
just watch the video that's totally fine

[07:15 - 07:19]
or there might be uh things where you

[07:16 - 07:21]
actually need Hardware to run it and so

[07:19 - 07:23]
you know maybe you need a Windows

[07:21 - 07:25]
machine or a Mac or a Linux machine and

[07:23 - 07:26]
you don't have that thing or you need a

[07:25 - 07:29]
certain amount of compute that's totally

[07:26 - 07:32]
fine just watch and and do the best you

[07:29 - 07:33]
can but where you can do things go do it

[07:32 - 07:35]
and there's a lot of free Solutions and

[07:33 - 07:38]
we try to focus as much on free

[07:35 - 07:39]
Solutions as possible uh so yeah just do

[07:38 - 07:43]
your best

[07:39 - 07:44]
okay um do uh paid online practice exams

[07:43 - 07:46]
that's just kind of something we always

[07:44 - 07:47]
throw in there for this course we have a

[07:46 - 07:50]
free practice exam there's no other

[07:47 - 07:52]
providers because this is a an exam made

[07:50 - 07:54]
by us at this point so we will have a

[07:52 - 07:56]
free practice exam so you'll have one

[07:54 - 07:59]
shot to do that and then you can pay to

[07:56 - 08:01]
do the uh the exam that gets you the

[07:59 - 08:04]
certification okay so it's up to you

[08:01 - 08:07]
that's going to be at at www. exampro

[08:04 - 08:10]
doco j001 so sign up to get your free

[08:07 - 08:14]
practice exam over there for grading uh

[08:10 - 08:17]
the passing score is above 750 points so

[08:14 - 08:20]
you need around 75% to pass you can fail

[08:17 - 08:25]
by getting exactly 75% it just depends

[08:20 - 08:26]
on how many um um uh questions there are

[08:25 - 08:28]
because they don't always split

[08:26 - 08:31]
perfectly and so you always want to aim

[08:28 - 08:33]
above that score okay for response types

[08:31 - 08:35]
there are 65 questions 65 scored

[08:33 - 08:37]
questions you can afford to get 16

[08:35 - 08:40]
scored uh questions wrong there are no

[08:37 - 08:42]
unscored questions other exams do that I

[08:40 - 08:43]
don't do that in my exams I I think it's

[08:42 - 08:45]
just stressful I think people would

[08:43 - 08:47]
rather just know exactly what they are

[08:45 - 08:49]
getting and do that there are no penalty

[08:47 - 08:51]
for wrong questions the format of

[08:49 - 08:53]
questions is multiple choice multiple

[08:51 - 08:55]
answer case studies case studies can be

[08:53 - 08:57]
worth more than a single point so the

[08:55 - 08:59]
distribution isn't perfectly like one

[08:57 - 09:02]
point per question uh in case studies

[08:59 - 09:04]
are more complex um um but uh you know

[09:02 - 09:06]
there's not that many so I wouldn't

[09:04 - 09:08]
stress out about it okay um the duration

[09:06 - 09:10]
is 2 hours you get two minutes per

[09:08 - 09:12]
question the exam time is 130 minutes

[09:10 - 09:15]
the seat time is 160 minutes I believe

[09:12 - 09:17]
that is correct yep yep yep yep um and

[09:15 - 09:18]
so the the SE time refers to the amount

[09:17 - 09:20]
of time that you should allocate for

[09:18 - 09:22]
this exam this includes the time review

[09:20 - 09:25]
instructions Show online Proctor uh

[09:22 - 09:26]
Proctor your Works Space read accept NDA

[09:25 - 09:28]
complete the exam provide feedback at

[09:26 - 09:30]
the end where do you take the exam

[09:28 - 09:32]
online from the conveni of your own home

[09:30 - 09:34]
exam Pro delivers the exam via teacher

[09:32 - 09:36]
seat anchor so I don't think people know

[09:34 - 09:38]
this but we actually have our own

[09:36 - 09:40]
Proctor system um now the question is

[09:38 - 09:42]
what format will it show up uh for this

[09:40 - 09:43]
because we have an external portal and

[09:42 - 09:45]
then we have one that's integrated I

[09:43 - 09:46]
don't know what's set up for this I

[09:45 - 09:48]
might make an additional video that's

[09:46 - 09:50]
only in the platform that you'd have to

[09:48 - 09:51]
watch to understand how to take the exam

[09:50 - 09:54]
so just look out for that um but it

[09:51 - 09:55]
shouldn't be too difficult but yeah it's

[09:54 - 09:57]
all exam Pro so the place where you

[09:55 - 09:59]
consume the course if if you're on

[09:57 - 10:01]
YouTube and you go to exam Pro and sign

[09:59 - 10:03]
up for for free you can then figure out

[10:01 - 10:05]
from that portal where to take the exam

[10:03 - 10:07]
and so hopefully that will make sense

[10:05 - 10:08]
there uh Proctor means that it's super

[10:07 - 10:10]
it has a supervisor a person who

[10:08 - 10:12]
monitors the student uh students during

[10:10 - 10:14]
the examination our Proctor system is a

[10:12 - 10:16]
little bit different whereas uh we might

[10:14 - 10:18]
capture the information and then audit

[10:16 - 10:21]
it later so it's not always a live

[10:18 - 10:22]
Proctor but like uh it will be it will

[10:21 - 10:26]
capture information and then it'll be an

[10:22 - 10:27]
audit audit period And if everything's

[10:26 - 10:29]
fine then we will release the course out

[10:27 - 10:33]
to you um but yeah we we'll see how

[10:29 - 10:35]
things go for that okay um this exam is

[10:33 - 10:37]
valid till well it's forever because

[10:35 - 10:39]
it's just how it works um other

[10:37 - 10:40]
certifications what they do is they'll

[10:39 - 10:42]
say good for two to three years and get

[10:40 - 10:44]
recertified um it's not like we have a

[10:42 - 10:48]
partner Network here so there's no

[10:44 - 10:49]
forcing of uh uh recertification but if

[10:48 - 10:52]
there is a major update you might want

[10:49 - 10:54]
to consider getting recertified because

[10:52 - 10:57]
there is just new knowledge there so I

[10:54 - 10:59]
mean the certification holds for as long

[10:57 - 11:01]
as there are no new versions um and

[10:59 - 11:03]
that's pretty much it so yeah hopefully

[11:01 - 11:04]
that is clear we didn't do an exam guide

[11:03 - 11:06]
breakdown I'm going to do that in a

[11:04 - 11:08]
separate video but we are going to look

[11:06 - 11:12]
at that maturity model here shortly

[11:08 - 11:15]
[Music]

[11:12 - 11:18]
okay hey everyone it's Andrew Brown and

[11:15 - 11:20]
I'm joined here with uh Rola um and so

[11:18 - 11:22]
we are going to be working our way

[11:20 - 11:24]
through the geni road map I believe

[11:22 - 11:27]
earlier in the uh introduction I

[11:24 - 11:30]
described this as a maturity model um

[11:27 - 11:35]
and so originally This was um very very

[11:30 - 11:39]
detailed um uh flowchart or road map

[11:35 - 11:43]
that Rola had produced along with um oh

[11:39 - 11:45]
Don Don and so I I took it and I I

[11:43 - 11:48]
mangled it or I should say I reorganize

[11:45 - 11:49]
it into what I call a maturity model

[11:48 - 11:52]
where the idea is that we can step

[11:49 - 11:54]
through it and have a way of

[11:52 - 11:57]
understanding where we might be in our

[11:54 - 11:59]
journey in terms of a gen road map by no

[11:57 - 12:02]
means is this an exhaustive list there

[11:59 - 12:05]
is so much in gen but I'm hoping that um

[12:02 - 12:08]
for those that are are starting to try

[12:05 - 12:10]
to understand gen that this will become

[12:08 - 12:12]
a a way for you to understand it and

[12:10 - 12:14]
then once you have that core knowledge

[12:12 - 12:15]
then you can be introduced to uh

[12:14 - 12:18]
something that is a little bit more

[12:15 - 12:20]
complex or robust and so what I want to

[12:18 - 12:23]
do here is I want to work uh walk

[12:20 - 12:26]
through with this uh with rollup and um

[12:23 - 12:28]
just confirm that uh we have a good

[12:26 - 12:31]
scope of learning here in terms of the

[12:28 - 12:32]
course that is that is here not

[12:31 - 12:35]
everything is included in the course

[12:32 - 12:37]
just because of um the strict time limit

[12:35 - 12:39]
I had to produce this course but I still

[12:37 - 12:41]
want everyone to see what the scope of

[12:39 - 12:43]
what I think people should learn and so

[12:41 - 12:45]
we'll start at the top and actually we

[12:43 - 12:47]
do have a lot of content um in the

[12:45 - 12:48]
course that is not in the ml

[12:47 - 12:50]
introduction but I think that if you're

[12:48 - 12:52]
going to learn generative AI you

[12:50 - 12:55]
probably need to have some understanding

[12:52 - 12:57]
of machine learning R do you think you

[12:55 - 12:59]
can skip it or you or you think it's an

[12:57 - 13:02]
absolute necessity to have some basics

[12:59 - 13:04]
of ml I think it depends on what you

[13:02 - 13:09]
want to do if you want to be just a

[13:04 - 13:13]
practitioner who sets up a single system

[13:09 - 13:16]
maybe you can skip it but if you want to

[13:13 - 13:19]
stay in the field um You probably need

[13:16 - 13:21]
some understanding of the bigger picture

[13:19 - 13:23]
and you know I think with lots of things

[13:21 - 13:26]
you can get away with with not knowing

[13:23 - 13:29]
for uh for a while but at some point you

[13:26 - 13:30]
will have to learn it and uh sometimes

[13:29 - 13:33]
it's better to learn something earlier

[13:30 - 13:34]
on than to uh push it back later I don't

[13:33 - 13:37]
think a lot of these things are that

[13:34 - 13:38]
hard like vectors and embeddings or um I

[13:37 - 13:40]
mean at first they seem very

[13:38 - 13:41]
intimidating like like seeing the

[13:40 - 13:43]
transform architecture and all those

[13:41 - 13:44]
moving Parts but I think there's a lot

[13:43 - 13:48]
of content out there that does break it

[13:44 - 13:49]
down into smaller smaller parts and um

[13:48 - 13:51]
uh I would just say it's like you don't

[13:49 - 13:54]
you don't have to be a mathematician to

[13:51 - 13:56]
to fully understand the basics of the ml

[13:54 - 13:58]
um and you don't need to be a car

[13:56 - 14:00]
mechanic to use a car right you if you

[13:58 - 14:03]
want to rent car and use it once that's

[14:00 - 14:04]
great but if you're going to use it

[14:03 - 14:07]
every day if it breaks down you need to

[14:04 - 14:09]
know where to look right um and also

[14:07 - 14:11]
those who that are watching we're both a

[14:09 - 14:14]
bit tired because yesterday was New

[14:11 - 14:17]
Year's uh New Year's Eve and so I was

[14:14 - 14:20]
passed up uh past past U midnight and I

[14:17 - 14:22]
think Rola as well uh so just understand

[14:20 - 14:24]
our energy levels are are high in our in

[14:22 - 14:27]
our

[14:24 - 14:29]
minds but um but anyway so after you

[14:27 - 14:31]
learn machine uh some basics of machine

[14:29 - 14:33]
learning I think that's that's a good a

[14:31 - 14:36]
good basis to now come into generative

[14:33 - 14:38]
AI um obviously I think that a lot of a

[14:36 - 14:40]
lot of people are interested in agents I

[14:38 - 14:42]
think that's what's talked about a lot

[14:40 - 14:45]
these days at least in what I hear when

[14:42 - 14:48]
we talk about gen um so you know there

[14:45 - 14:49]
are some things uh like agentic

[14:48 - 14:51]
workflows and agentic coding it's a bit

[14:49 - 14:53]
odd that I put them here because these

[14:51 - 14:56]
are very Advanced topics but I put them

[14:53 - 14:57]
in here early just because I know people

[14:56 - 15:01]
want to know about them and talk about

[14:57 - 15:03]
them and so it was more so to dive into

[15:01 - 15:05]
these things in deep but more just to

[15:03 - 15:09]
tell people yeah this is the angle of

[15:05 - 15:10]
where you might want to want to go go if

[15:09 - 15:13]
that makes sense um obviously

[15:10 - 15:15]
responsible AI is maybe a higher

[15:13 - 15:17]
priority for folks I'm not sure uh what

[15:15 - 15:18]
could go in here but even though this

[15:17 - 15:21]
this part looks really small basically

[15:18 - 15:25]
the Gen introduction is is more so like

[15:21 - 15:27]
uh I don't know like this part here um

[15:25 - 15:30]
but yeah that's what I have for the geni

[15:27 - 15:32]
but I think um one thing that is uh

[15:30 - 15:34]
really interesting is the modalities of

[15:32 - 15:36]
generative AI um and I think that a lot

[15:34 - 15:39]
of folks just focus on text generation

[15:36 - 15:41]
llms but there is this whole skew of

[15:39 - 15:43]
things video generation 3D Generation

[15:41 - 15:45]
image generation audio generation are

[15:43 - 15:47]
there any more types of generations that

[15:45 - 15:50]
I'm missing out on there

[15:47 - 15:52]
Rolla um I think there's a bunch on

[15:50 - 15:53]
protein and DNA which I mean they can

[15:52 - 15:56]
look like they're text but they're

[15:53 - 15:59]
specialized types of text um there's a

[15:56 - 16:01]
lot to do with protein uh folding and

[15:59 - 16:05]
things like that that also been used in

[16:01 - 16:07]
gen so there's a few very Niche um

[16:05 - 16:10]
topics but these are the main ones I

[16:07 - 16:12]
think text image video audio 3D yeah

[16:10 - 16:16]
those are the main but there are

[16:12 - 16:19]
Niche uh topics that have to do with

[16:16 - 16:21]
health science or very specific uh

[16:19 - 16:22]
Fields well it's a bit it's a bit tricky

[16:21 - 16:24]
there because like you look at images

[16:22 - 16:27]
and videos and and video is just a

[16:24 - 16:29]
series of images or you have 3D and 3D

[16:27 - 16:32]
uh or 3D files and they're just uh

[16:29 - 16:34]
vertices and and text files but yeah I

[16:32 - 16:35]
guess there are specialized ones and

[16:34 - 16:37]
that's the thing as I don't know of

[16:35 - 16:41]
anything beyond as you said like things

[16:37 - 16:42]
in um the health scien Health Sciences

[16:41 - 16:44]
if there's anything else that we would

[16:42 - 16:46]
consider a modality but these are the

[16:44 - 16:48]
main ones one thing that's kind of

[16:46 - 16:50]
really hard to figure out is like if you

[16:48 - 16:55]
have video to video or uh image text to

[16:50 - 16:57]
image is it the modality of text or

[16:55 - 16:59]
video based on if it has one or the

[16:57 - 17:01]
other the way I I put them in is like if

[16:59 - 17:03]
it outputs that thing that I put it into

[17:01 - 17:05]
that modality but I don't sure if we

[17:03 - 17:08]
have to think about it in such clear-cut

[17:05 - 17:10]
binary way of thinking these type of um

[17:08 - 17:11]
uh inputs outputs for these different

[17:10 - 17:14]
types of

[17:11 - 17:16]
models no and I think we put them there

[17:14 - 17:18]
initially to to just given people the

[17:16 - 17:21]
idea that there is a lot Beyond just

[17:18 - 17:23]
text generation right there's a whole

[17:21 - 17:24]
slew of things happening and what

[17:23 - 17:25]
usually happens is if you look at a

[17:24 - 17:26]
model card if you're looking for

[17:25 - 17:28]
something specific and you look at a

[17:26 - 17:30]
model card they will tell you what the

[17:28 - 17:32]
input and out to that model is and you

[17:30 - 17:34]
look for something very specific so I

[17:32 - 17:36]
think it's just enough to know that

[17:34 - 17:40]
other modalities exist both in input and

[17:36 - 17:43]
output and that you can find uh a model

[17:40 - 17:45]
that suits the input output combination

[17:43 - 17:48]
that you are interested in and I think

[17:45 - 17:49]
that since the creation of this um uh

[17:48 - 17:52]
this flowchart actually there's been an

[17:49 - 17:54]
explosion of video generation tools that

[17:52 - 17:56]
I can't even name them all so that's why

[17:54 - 17:58]
I'm kind of hesitant to put uh put names

[17:56 - 18:00]
here I mean whisper is still hanging

[17:58 - 18:02]
around for audio generation but uh yeah

[18:00 - 18:05]
for video there's everybody has one

[18:02 - 18:07]
right now um and so I don't know it just

[18:05 - 18:08]
kind of shows like how fast things are

[18:07 - 18:10]
moving even in a few months like

[18:08 - 18:12]
there'll be just an explosion of models

[18:10 - 18:14]
um in those areas but when you know the

[18:12 - 18:16]
basis of these

[18:14 - 18:18]
things but if you know video to video

[18:16 - 18:19]
you know what video to video is right uh

[18:18 - 18:21]
at least at a high level of what that

[18:19 - 18:23]
means because underneath that could mean

[18:21 - 18:25]
something completely else and it's

[18:23 - 18:26]
moving very fast I think all of the all

[18:25 - 18:28]
of the most of the things that we've

[18:26 - 18:30]
seen in the public eye are about two

[18:28 - 18:32]
years years old at the moment so

[18:30 - 18:35]
whenever you read an article on gen or

[18:32 - 18:39]
something notice the date because things

[18:35 - 18:40]
get outdated very fast well it's also

[18:39 - 18:43]
really hard to figure out what to

[18:40 - 18:44]
include practically because um as I'm

[18:43 - 18:46]
doing stuff everyone's like oh use that

[18:44 - 18:47]
did you hear of this constantly did you

[18:46 - 18:49]
hear this did you hear that and I'm just

[18:47 - 18:51]
opening these things and going well

[18:49 - 18:53]
which is relevant and which is not but I

[18:51 - 18:56]
think that um even if you do use a tool

[18:53 - 18:57]
that might become dated I think that

[18:56 - 18:59]
there are things that are always going

[18:57 - 19:01]
to be in that realm of that kind of

[18:59 - 19:02]
stuff and so it's not fully wasted

[19:01 - 19:04]
information you just kind of have to

[19:02 - 19:05]
move as quick as you can and you're

[19:04 - 19:07]
going to have to expect that uh things

[19:05 - 19:09]
are going to be uh the floor is going to

[19:07 - 19:11]
be moving uh moving around on you all

[19:09 - 19:14]
the time yeah for text generation text

[19:11 - 19:17]
to XX single turn multi- turn I have

[19:14 - 19:19]
multimodel multimodal multimodel a lot

[19:17 - 19:21]
of terms that seem very similar now

[19:19 - 19:23]
we're into LM Basics which is still a

[19:21 - 19:25]
generative AI a lot of stuff here we

[19:23 - 19:27]
have a repeat of ethics and bias because

[19:25 - 19:31]
we have resp responsible which have some

[19:27 - 19:34]
overlap um and so you know looking into

[19:31 - 19:35]
LMS probably the most important thing is

[19:34 - 19:39]
understanding I don't know like

[19:35 - 19:41]
tokenization aony of appr prompt um I'm

[19:39 - 19:43]
not sure what else there is there but

[19:41 - 19:46]
yeah if you fundamentally understand I

[19:43 - 19:48]
think like what a context window is uh

[19:46 - 19:52]
and what it can do then you have a lot

[19:48 - 19:53]
of power just with llms there um we have

[19:52 - 19:55]
it we're like I'm supposed to have a

[19:53 - 19:56]
section on prompt engineering down here

[19:55 - 19:59]
and even this I didn't do all of the

[19:56 - 20:01]
videos but I realized that as was making

[19:59 - 20:03]
some of the content here I

[20:01 - 20:04]
subconsciously was utilizing some prompt

[20:03 - 20:07]
engineering techniques that I wasn't

[20:04 - 20:09]
aware of and I don't I'm not sure how

[20:07 - 20:10]
much value there is to like learning

[20:09 - 20:13]
every possible prompt engineer technique

[20:10 - 20:15]
because there's walls and walls of of

[20:13 - 20:18]
possible ways that you can do things but

[20:15 - 20:20]
it is really interesting that um uh you

[20:18 - 20:22]
know if you just are you just have an

[20:20 - 20:24]
idea of creatively how you can feed

[20:22 - 20:27]
stuff into prompt engineering that you

[20:24 - 20:28]
might implicitly be uh doing them uh how

[20:27 - 20:29]
much do you keep on top of prompt

[20:28 - 20:32]
engineering techniques do you feel that

[20:29 - 20:35]
it's worth going learning all 200 of

[20:32 - 20:37]
them or no no I don't I mean things are

[20:35 - 20:38]
going to keep changing I think the the

[20:37 - 20:41]
main things that have shown promise are

[20:38 - 20:42]
good to know and those are usually a

[20:41 - 20:44]
handful of things right and we can talk

[20:42 - 20:46]
about them in the course I think

[20:44 - 20:47]
understanding the anatomy of the prompt

[20:46 - 20:51]
is really important that's what's going

[20:47 - 20:54]
to allow you to understand um you know

[20:51 - 20:56]
what you can do and and how that affects

[20:54 - 20:59]
the model I think that's very important

[20:56 - 21:02]
but you know um there there's going to

[20:59 - 21:03]
be a lot of papers and a lot of um

[21:02 - 21:06]
understanding of things as they come I

[21:03 - 21:08]
don't think they all move the needle in

[21:06 - 21:10]
huge ways uh those the do you'll hear

[21:08 - 21:13]
about but I think those are a handful

[21:10 - 21:16]
you don't need to know all 200

[21:13 - 21:17]
no uh in terms of AI power assistance I

[21:16 - 21:19]
feel like that's one of the the first

[21:17 - 21:22]
entry points that a lot of people have

[21:19 - 21:24]
with um uh uh generative AI but you know

[21:22 - 21:25]
what when it came to these videos I

[21:24 - 21:28]
didn't have much to say because they're

[21:25 - 21:30]
all kind of the same um and and there's

[21:28 - 21:33]
not that much functionality built around

[21:30 - 21:36]
them now some some AI par assistant have

[21:33 - 21:39]
some bells and whistles uh like Claude

[21:36 - 21:42]
has the idea of projects or chat PT has

[21:39 - 21:45]
that really cool voice feature or Google

[21:42 - 21:46]
Gemini they supposedly can process

[21:45 - 21:50]
larger types of PDFs and the way they do

[21:46 - 21:52]
it is special and um actually I think AI

[21:50 - 21:54]
21 I don't know they have or AI 21

[21:52 - 21:56]
technically has an AI power assistant

[21:54 - 21:57]
but some of these things here they're

[21:56 - 21:59]
not intended to even act as AI power

[21:57 - 22:00]
assistants they're just there as

[21:59 - 22:02]
demonstrations so like when you go to

[22:00 - 22:03]
meta or mistol I don't think you're

[22:02 - 22:05]
supposed to use them as your day-to-day

[22:03 - 22:09]
AI part assistance it's supp it's mostly

[22:05 - 22:10]
just to show you a means to do that um

[22:09 - 22:12]
but you know with with your level of

[22:10 - 22:16]
knowledge do you use AI power Assistance

[22:12 - 22:21]
or or do you do you roll your own so to

[22:16 - 22:23]
speak um um I tend to like to do things

[22:21 - 22:27]
my way but because I trust my own

[22:23 - 22:30]
systems uh I we do we do rely on

[22:27 - 22:32]
anthropic CLA quite a bit uh my team

[22:30 - 22:38]
uses a lot of cursor for coding and

[22:32 - 22:41]
things like that uh my main issue is

[22:38 - 22:44]
the the probability I would like to

[22:41 - 22:47]
understand what how good what the

[22:44 - 22:50]
probability confidence in any particular

[22:47 - 22:52]
responses which right now okay yeah

[22:50 - 22:54]
right now it doesn't tell you right it

[22:52 - 22:57]
just gives you an answer know yeah I

[22:54 - 22:58]
never thought about that yeah so but I

[22:57 - 23:01]
guess like when you're using

[22:58 - 23:02]
uh uh models direct directly would they

[23:01 - 23:04]
give you probability or or would you

[23:02 - 23:07]
have to do some uh some uh post

[23:04 - 23:08]
calculation to get that in predictive AI

[23:07 - 23:10]
most models give you some sort of

[23:08 - 23:14]
probability of confidence some sort of

[23:10 - 23:16]
measure of how well it thinks it

[23:14 - 23:17]
did but that's that's but we were

[23:16 - 23:20]
talking about just general models like

[23:17 - 23:22]
any kind of ml model is that what you're

[23:20 - 23:24]
saying but with LMS would they have to

[23:22 - 23:27]
would they also explicitly return them

[23:24 - 23:29]
as well or no so uh most llms do not

[23:27 - 23:33]
because they're ating sequences word

[23:29 - 23:36]
after word they do not tell you what

[23:33 - 23:39]
the what the models

[23:36 - 23:40]
um how well the model thinks it did but

[23:39 - 23:42]
in other probably if you're doing a

[23:40 - 23:43]
classification for example it would tell

[23:42 - 23:47]
you

[23:43 - 23:49]
um so I guess that's a good thing it's a

[23:47 - 23:52]
good thing that you said there because

[23:49 - 23:53]
uh when we talk about um llms you have

[23:52 - 23:57]
to everyone talks about having uh

[23:53 - 23:59]
evaluations right but is it because the

[23:57 - 24:01]
nature of LMS makes it hard for it to

[23:59 - 24:02]
produce that number so you have to have

[24:01 - 24:05]
an additional step whereas when you're

[24:02 - 24:08]
using a classical machine learning model

[24:05 - 24:09]
it's producing a single value and then

[24:08 - 24:12]
it can also give you the probability

[24:09 - 24:13]
back at the same time kind of so in

[24:12 - 24:16]
predictive machine learning

[24:13 - 24:18]
traditionally it was very task specific

[24:16 - 24:20]
so you trained it on a very specific

[24:18 - 24:22]
task and so it learned that task and it

[24:20 - 24:24]
gave you some sort of metric of its

[24:22 - 24:26]
performance on that result now

[24:24 - 24:29]
generative AI tends to be and

[24:26 - 24:31]
foundational model llms tend to be more

[24:29 - 24:34]
um their general purpose so they can do

[24:31 - 24:35]
a lot more things and they can do

[24:34 - 24:39]
different types of things beyond the

[24:35 - 24:40]
things that they were um trained to do

[24:39 - 24:42]
that's where all these evaluation

[24:40 - 24:46]
metrics come in is is if you see and we

[24:42 - 24:48]
talked about this at some point um is

[24:46 - 24:49]
they would tell you what how does it

[24:48 - 24:51]
Benchmark on coding how does it

[24:49 - 24:55]
Benchmark on reasoning how does it

[24:51 - 24:57]
Benchmark on accuracy um because they

[24:55 - 24:59]
they they can do a lot more things than

[24:57 - 25:00]
we train them on because they're very

[24:59 - 25:04]
very large models and so there's

[25:00 - 25:06]
emergent properties that come with

[25:04 - 25:08]
that um and

[25:06 - 25:09]
so I'm just going to iterate here that

[25:08 - 25:12]
AI power assistance is I think where a

[25:09 - 25:13]
lot of people uh start learning it but

[25:12 - 25:15]
uh what happens is that when you're

[25:13 - 25:17]
using AI power assistance you find out

[25:15 - 25:19]
that it doesn't have a programmatic way

[25:17 - 25:21]
for you to start implementing it for

[25:19 - 25:23]
your own Solutions and you know the

[25:21 - 25:25]
purpose of this course is to show folks

[25:23 - 25:27]
how to go beyond the AI power assistance

[25:25 - 25:29]
of course you can leverage this course

[25:27 - 25:32]
to do the best that you can do with a

[25:29 - 25:33]
powered assistance but um you really

[25:32 - 25:35]
want to move Beyond in this kind of part

[25:33 - 25:37]
here I almost I feel that I should have

[25:35 - 25:40]
a little line here because this is where

[25:37 - 25:42]
the real story starts right after oops

[25:40 - 25:44]
that's not what I wanted but if I can uh

[25:42 - 25:46]
get this open here it's not I don't know

[25:44 - 25:49]
how to get my shapes here's my shapes

[25:46 - 25:50]
but I feel that right here uh yeah if I

[25:49 - 25:52]
if I was to draw a line right here this

[25:50 - 25:55]
is where things start to get serious

[25:52 - 25:56]
it's obviously an arrow not a line um

[25:55 - 25:58]
and this is where you start get into

[25:56 - 25:59]
workbenches and playgrounds surpris

[25:58 - 26:01]
techically I showed where all the

[25:59 - 26:03]
workbenches were and playgrounds were in

[26:01 - 26:05]
these various Solutions but I didn't

[26:03 - 26:06]
really use them I just skipped right

[26:05 - 26:09]
over to code because there's not much to

[26:06 - 26:12]
talk about they're they look a lot like

[26:09 - 26:16]
a assistance they do have more uh knobs

[26:12 - 26:18]
uh knobs to turn like uh what top K and

[26:16 - 26:20]
temperature and things like that once

[26:18 - 26:22]
you learn one they all kind of feel very

[26:20 - 26:25]
similar but uh some of them will have

[26:22 - 26:27]
interfaces to their extended uh extended

[26:25 - 26:30]
functionality so like if you're using a

[26:27 - 26:33]
CO here they would have a little box for

[26:30 - 26:37]
the response format for Json if you're

[26:33 - 26:39]
in um uh anthropic uh then if you want

[26:37 - 26:41]
to do tool use you could do that in

[26:39 - 26:43]
place and some of them will generate at

[26:41 - 26:45]
the code for you so you can start

[26:43 - 26:48]
utilizing them and sometimes they gener

[26:45 - 26:49]
out good code I can't say they always do

[26:48 - 26:51]
I think in some of them they're actually

[26:49 - 26:54]
producing older code I'm actually really

[26:51 - 26:56]
surprised um with how many AI

[26:54 - 26:58]
Services uh like they'll have a version

[26:56 - 27:00]
to uh API and and then their main

[26:58 - 27:03]
service that Jour toota is still doing

[27:00 - 27:05]
version one uh and it almost kind of

[27:03 - 27:06]
feels like uh these companies kind of

[27:05 - 27:09]
even keep up with their own their own

[27:06 - 27:11]
changes which is really surprising um

[27:09 - 27:15]
but I'm not sure what your experience is

[27:11 - 27:16]
about um documentation and how how

[27:15 - 27:19]
accurate it reflects the current

[27:16 - 27:22]
versions of things usually they're

[27:19 - 27:23]
they're behind I think part of it is the

[27:22 - 27:25]
the speed of things but also I think

[27:23 - 27:27]
part of it is cost right the the older

[27:25 - 27:30]
mod model is likely smaller and it's

[27:27 - 27:32]
likely cheaper uh and so some some of it

[27:30 - 27:35]
is

[27:32 - 27:36]
cost um so you know once you start

[27:35 - 27:38]
working with things programmatically at

[27:36 - 27:39]
least in this way before you even start

[27:38 - 27:42]
writing code you might start to think

[27:39 - 27:44]
about what kind of models you want to

[27:42 - 27:46]
use and there's all kinds of models out

[27:44 - 27:47]
there there's foundational models we

[27:46 - 27:48]
have models that are fine- tune which

[27:47 - 27:51]
technically Foundation models are fine

[27:48 - 27:53]
tune models models that are instruct

[27:51 - 27:55]
models we have embed models we have open

[27:53 - 27:58]
source models we have Edge optimized

[27:55 - 28:01]
models or we could call them slm small

[27:58 - 28:02]
language models or we could call them on

[28:01 - 28:04]
device models or we could call them

[28:02 - 28:06]
something else there's a lot of names

[28:04 - 28:09]
for this one in particular um and then

[28:06 - 28:11]
we have uncensored or you could say

[28:09 - 28:12]
unrestricted I don't know the word

[28:11 - 28:15]
uncensored doesn't sound good but

[28:12 - 28:18]
unrestricted models uh and we have a lot

[28:15 - 28:21]
of models why do we have so many darn

[28:18 - 28:22]
models um so I think these are all

[28:21 - 28:27]
different terminologies

[28:22 - 28:29]
to um to describe different metadata

[28:27 - 28:31]
about the models so open you know open

[28:29 - 28:35]
source models are models where the

[28:31 - 28:37]
weights are open um plus the data plus

[28:35 - 28:39]
the code open weight models are models

[28:37 - 28:42]
where the weights are open but not the

[28:39 - 28:45]
data and the code so each word descri

[28:42 - 28:47]
each term describes a very

[28:45 - 28:49]
specific scenario so Edge optimized

[28:47 - 28:51]
models are usually smaller models that

[28:49 - 28:53]
you could put on your phones and Edge

[28:51 - 28:56]
devices as opposed to the larger models

[28:53 - 28:59]
that need a server so because there's so

[28:56 - 29:02]
many different um

[28:59 - 29:04]
ways that you could use these things you

[29:02 - 29:06]
have to have words to describe the

[29:04 - 29:08]
different situations I

[29:06 - 29:09]
guess and I think there's probably a lot

[29:08 - 29:13]
more open weight models than there are

[29:09 - 29:14]
open source models um there might be a

[29:13 - 29:16]
bit of a confusion between that because

[29:14 - 29:18]
I always think like I like this is open

[29:16 - 29:19]
source model like but is it I mean I can

[29:18 - 29:20]
download the weights and I can do things

[29:19 - 29:24]
with it but I don't really know how

[29:20 - 29:28]
they've trained it um one

[29:24 - 29:30]
model mistol and um

[29:28 - 29:32]
uh meta tend to be open weight models

[29:30 - 29:34]
but they're not open source models so

[29:32 - 29:35]
the data and the code that generated the

[29:34 - 29:41]
models are not

[29:35 - 29:45]
there um open Ai and uh is is a closed

[29:41 - 29:47]
model and anthropic is a closed model um

[29:45 - 29:49]
yeah so there's different ways in which

[29:47 - 29:52]
these things are released allowing

[29:49 - 29:55]
people different types of

[29:52 - 29:58]
control um and that's where the the

[29:55 - 30:01]
naming comes in and and I like if people

[29:58 - 30:03]
are watching here yes I'm updating the

[30:01 - 30:05]
this as we go because that's how it is

[30:03 - 30:08]
you collect information and you you find

[30:05 - 30:10]
new ways of organizing it uh I know of

[30:08 - 30:12]
of one open source model that I can that

[30:10 - 30:14]
I can always remember which is IBM

[30:12 - 30:17]
Granite because they say that their

[30:14 - 30:19]
model is truly open source and and by

[30:17 - 30:21]
that they mean like you even know what

[30:19 - 30:23]
data was sourced to train the model um

[30:21 - 30:25]
so it's really interesting the different

[30:23 - 30:26]
levels of things there we have models of

[30:25 - 30:28]
service so I think this is probably one

[30:26 - 30:31]
of the easiest ways to start working

[30:28 - 30:35]
with llms um and and some other

[30:31 - 30:37]
modalities uh where they provide a a

[30:35 - 30:41]
unified API to access to multiple

[30:37 - 30:44]
different models um and so Google Amazon

[30:41 - 30:46]
Azure and Alibaba all have them actually

[30:44 - 30:49]
I haven't tried Alibaba yet I just know

[30:46 - 30:50]
that they have it and I was I was I I

[30:49 - 30:53]
said I was goingon to go use Alibaba I

[30:50 - 30:54]
never did um is there any other ones

[30:53 - 30:56]
that are out there the only other ones

[30:54 - 30:58]
that I can think of that are models of

[30:56 - 31:00]
service is grock

[30:58 - 31:03]
grq for those that are listening there's

[31:00 - 31:05]
a lot of GRS um in the AI space and it

[31:03 - 31:09]
gets a bit confusing but that one was

[31:05 - 31:12]
amazing however um they don't have a

[31:09 - 31:13]
paid a paid tier so like you can use it

[31:12 - 31:17]
and it's super fast and it's only for

[31:13 - 31:21]
open source models but um uh they don't

[31:17 - 31:23]
have a a payment plan so you can't even

[31:21 - 31:25]
utilize for production they do have a

[31:23 - 31:27]
business plan but um it's a bit hard to

[31:25 - 31:29]
get in there and so once we're done with

[31:27 - 31:33]
models of service now it's time to get

[31:29 - 31:34]
serious and we're actually looking at um

[31:33 - 31:36]
out like some of these are cloud

[31:34 - 31:39]
services but now we're getting into a

[31:36 - 31:41]
very serious um development and this

[31:39 - 31:44]
could involve actually downloading

[31:41 - 31:46]
models to your computer or uh using uh

[31:44 - 31:48]
best-in-class thirdparty cloud services

[31:46 - 31:51]
and so this is not exactly organized the

[31:48 - 31:54]
same way as the course but now we are

[31:51 - 31:55]
into Dev tools and workflows and so

[31:54 - 31:58]
something that folks probably should

[31:55 - 31:59]
know about Is the Gen life cycle l mops

[31:58 - 32:01]
these are Concepts that sound very

[31:59 - 32:03]
similar in the cloud space when we talk

[32:01 - 32:06]
about I don't know the development life

[32:03 - 32:07]
cycle and devops but um they can be

[32:06 - 32:10]
applied there as well and then there's

[32:07 - 32:10]
just some core developer tools that I

[32:10 - 32:13]
think that people are always going to

[32:10 - 32:14]
come across like I'm on hugging face

[32:13 - 32:19]
hugging face all the time it's like the

[32:14 - 32:22]
GitHub of the AIML world I was surprised

[32:19 - 32:25]
that I I used AMA more than I thought um

[32:22 - 32:28]
uh do you ever touch Ama or is it um

[32:25 - 32:30]
it's not for you Rola I have but I I

[32:28 - 32:32]
know people love it it's it's open

[32:30 - 32:34]
source there's a lot it's a lot more

[32:32 - 32:36]
open than a lot of other systems so

[32:34 - 32:38]
people like it I haven't personally

[32:36 - 32:41]
played too much with it

[32:38 - 32:44]
but I I don't even

[32:41 - 32:46]
remember I don't even remember what LMS

[32:44 - 32:49]
is I'm not even sure what that is but

[32:46 - 32:50]
it's in there uh so I can't remember

[32:49 - 32:52]
that must have been something at one

[32:50 - 32:53]
point but now I don't know what it is

[32:52 - 32:56]
almost tempted to delete it we got llama

[32:53 - 32:57]
file Lang chain llama index these two

[32:56 - 32:59]
things were things that I heard a lot

[32:57 - 33:01]
about early on when I was I was learning

[32:59 - 33:03]
about generative Ai and I actually ended

[33:01 - 33:04]
up once I started gaining so much

[33:03 - 33:06]
knowledge I don't even touch them at all

[33:04 - 33:08]
now I don't even think I even bothered

[33:06 - 33:09]
to teach them because even though they

[33:08 - 33:12]
were uh I think they're actually really

[33:09 - 33:14]
good as a as a learning tool um I just

[33:12 - 33:16]
found that uh the the promise of what

[33:14 - 33:18]
they were supposed to provide was to

[33:16 - 33:20]
give you an opinionated framework so you

[33:18 - 33:22]
could rapidly prototype things but uh

[33:20 - 33:24]
because this space again has mve so

[33:22 - 33:26]
quickly um a lot of the documentation

[33:24 - 33:29]
was out of dat or The implementations

[33:26 - 33:32]
Underneath didn't really live up to the

[33:29 - 33:35]
promise um do you use any kind of um

[33:32 - 33:38]
orchestrational uh services or uh

[33:35 - 33:41]
Frameworks for rapidly building out llms

[33:38 - 33:44]
or or like agents or workloads or what

[33:41 - 33:47]
do you do so our team usually uses

[33:44 - 33:49]
sometimes Lang chain um and guardio to

[33:47 - 33:51]
create very fast prototypes um but like

[33:49 - 33:54]
you said everything's catching up so

[33:51 - 33:56]
even Bedrock we use a lot of AWS bedrock

[33:54 - 33:58]
and now they can you can do a lot of

[33:56 - 34:00]
these things natively in Bedrock now you

[33:58 - 34:04]
can do a lot of workflows and and model

[34:00 - 34:06]
changings and so on which uh you know

[34:04 - 34:08]
they they were quite you know some of

[34:06 - 34:10]
the first tools that came out but now a

[34:08 - 34:12]
lot of things are catching up like you

[34:10 - 34:14]
said well yeah and and it's it's really

[34:12 - 34:16]
surprising like how robust Amazon

[34:14 - 34:19]
bedrocks coming on the Azure side they

[34:16 - 34:21]
were they were leveraging open AI but

[34:19 - 34:24]
now they have their own generic one like

[34:21 - 34:27]
Amazon Bedrock um I don't not sure why I

[34:24 - 34:29]
put gml over here I mean they it's by

[34:27 - 34:33]
the same creator gml and

[34:29 - 34:34]
ggf um but uh llama CPP that's something

[34:33 - 34:37]
I just want to do more with because it

[34:34 - 34:39]
sounds so awesome but um and it comes up

[34:37 - 34:43]
a lot but I I I didn't get to spend too

[34:39 - 34:45]
much time there with it um and Onyx is

[34:43 - 34:47]
something I again I I really wish I had

[34:45 - 34:50]
time to talk about that more because

[34:47 - 34:53]
that came up a lot um for compatibility

[34:50 - 34:55]
for model weights uh I try to remember

[34:53 - 34:57]
what it does it's it's a file format

[34:55 - 34:58]
it's like is it like ggf but a different

[34:57 - 35:00]
file for

[34:58 - 35:03]
you remember what Onyx Onyx is in

[35:00 - 35:06]
particular no I'm not sure actually so

[35:03 - 35:06]
this one

[35:06 - 35:14]
here um I remember it's

[35:10 - 35:17]
a this is for interop

[35:14 - 35:20]
interoperability um and that's the idea

[35:17 - 35:21]
of um kind of using the same formats or

[35:20 - 35:23]
the

[35:21 - 35:27]
same

[35:23 - 35:28]
um the way you encode the the models and

[35:27 - 35:29]
all of that in the same way so that you

[35:28 - 35:32]
can

[35:29 - 35:33]
actually exchange use the same systems

[35:32 - 35:36]
across different models and across

[35:33 - 35:38]
different providers and so on um I know

[35:36 - 35:40]
a lot about interoperability from

[35:38 - 35:42]
healthcare because everybody does what

[35:40 - 35:44]
they want and it's a becomes a headache

[35:42 - 35:48]
which is where the space in AI is as

[35:44 - 35:50]
well right every provider um releases in

[35:48 - 35:52]
whatever encoding they want and

[35:50 - 35:55]
tokenizer they want and they encode on

[35:52 - 35:58]
disk the way they want and so that uh

[35:55 - 36:00]
makes it a bit hard to

[35:58 - 36:04]
um kind of use the similar systems

[36:00 - 36:05]
across models and across so that that's

[36:04 - 36:07]
great yeah it's definitely an

[36:05 - 36:09]
interesting topping it it would make

[36:07 - 36:12]
life easier for everybody if we have

[36:09 - 36:14]
certain uh Common

[36:12 - 36:16]
Grounds see see I knew you knew it

[36:14 - 36:18]
because as soon as I opened it up it

[36:16 - 36:21]
took you two seconds to know what it was

[36:18 - 36:23]
um app prototyping i' I like I come from

[36:21 - 36:26]
a developer background so for me I I

[36:23 - 36:27]
really enjoy AI code code assistance and

[36:26 - 36:29]
app prototyping and this course we

[36:27 - 36:32]
covered Streamlight gradio I think we

[36:29 - 36:34]
did Fast HTML uh vzero and lovable

[36:32 - 36:37]
there's actually a few other ones that

[36:34 - 36:38]
that I had covered as well um and then

[36:37 - 36:42]
on the other side we have ai code

[36:38 - 36:44]
assistance so we Amazon Q developer I I

[36:42 - 36:48]
did cover that one GitHub co-pilot

[36:44 - 36:49]
Gemini code assist codium cursor um and

[36:48 - 36:52]
these things are actually this one has

[36:49 - 36:54]
codium in Wind surf now which uh I would

[36:52 - 36:57]
say I really like wind surf but again

[36:54 - 37:00]
you know things change every other day

[36:57 - 37:02]
um and uh it's just neck and neck these

[37:00 - 37:03]
these tools are changing and so having

[37:02 - 37:05]
general knowledge about the tools and

[37:03 - 37:07]
not really being focused on just one

[37:05 - 37:09]
thing with conception understanding is

[37:07 - 37:10]
going to just make your technical path a

[37:09 - 37:12]
lot easier because you're not never

[37:10 - 37:13]
going to be left behind uh and you

[37:12 - 37:15]
basically are just jumping ship

[37:13 - 37:17]
constantly to new tools but it's not

[37:15 - 37:19]
that big of a deal except when every

[37:17 - 37:22]
tool cost

[37:19 - 37:24]
$20 then then you have to decide decide

[37:22 - 37:26]
which one you're going to unsubscribe to

[37:24 - 37:27]
I put extra emphasis in this course on

[37:26 - 37:29]
setting up the developer environment I

[37:27 - 37:31]
found that this was um one of the

[37:29 - 37:33]
largest challenges with working with

[37:31 - 37:36]
local models understanding how to set up

[37:33 - 37:39]
cond uh installing Docker containers uh

[37:36 - 37:41]
pulling containers uh setting up Jupiter

[37:39 - 37:44]
a Jupiter server because that's a very

[37:41 - 37:46]
com a common way um and I was actually

[37:44 - 37:47]
really surprised on how many free

[37:46 - 37:50]
options there are right now to learn I

[37:47 - 37:52]
think a lot of people think that uh well

[37:50 - 37:54]
it is expensive to run models but a lot

[37:52 - 37:57]
of people think that it's that it's too

[37:54 - 37:59]
prohibitively expensive to learn gen but

[37:57 - 38:02]
I is just blown away by how many

[37:59 - 38:04]
resources are right now um as every

[38:02 - 38:06]
company is putting out their own

[38:04 - 38:09]
Kool-Aid for you to drink that they

[38:06 - 38:10]
really want you to uh buy into it and

[38:09 - 38:14]
I'm sure at some point that this will

[38:10 - 38:17]
change as as the um uh the space matures

[38:14 - 38:18]
and everybody understands that but right

[38:17 - 38:20]
now is like the best time to learn

[38:18 - 38:21]
because there's so many free free

[38:20 - 38:25]
resources it's

[38:21 - 38:26]
unbelievable um but uh would you do you

[38:25 - 38:28]
agree or would you say do you think do

[38:26 - 38:30]
you see a lot of a lot of free learning

[38:28 - 38:32]
opportunities right now or like with I

[38:30 - 38:36]
do I think there's a lot from from all

[38:32 - 38:38]
the big providers AWS

[38:36 - 38:40]
gcp uh hugging face has a lot of things

[38:38 - 38:43]
there's a lot from a lot of different

[38:40 - 38:47]
resources all small startups as well I

[38:43 - 38:49]
think there's always great resources um

[38:47 - 38:51]
it's a matter of time I think and

[38:49 - 38:53]
commitment well even like in hugging

[38:51 - 38:54]
face they have all these projects

[38:53 - 38:57]
running here and you open it up and they

[38:54 - 38:59]
have something called like um uh

[38:57 - 39:01]
something zero it's and I don't know

[38:59 - 39:03]
what it is but it's it's like some kind

[39:01 - 39:05]
of compute that is distributed that

[39:03 - 39:07]
allows you to run anything this is not

[39:05 - 39:09]
exact the one I meant to click on but

[39:07 - 39:11]
it's just very interesting that there

[39:09 - 39:12]
are so many of these things running and

[39:11 - 39:15]
I'm just like how do they how do they

[39:12 - 39:17]
have the money for all these for all

[39:15 - 39:19]
this compute but they do and it's not

[39:17 - 39:23]
showing the name of it's called g0 or

[39:19 - 39:24]
something or um something but um uh yeah

[39:23 - 39:26]
it's just it's just really interesting

[39:24 - 39:29]
one part that's a little bit hard for me

[39:26 - 39:30]
to cover is ji security I'm not sure if

[39:29 - 39:32]
it's because things are still emerging

[39:30 - 39:34]
we do have a few friends on the security

[39:32 - 39:37]
side that are going to help us out at

[39:34 - 39:41]
some point to um expand on this but I

[39:37 - 39:44]
imagine that this is uh rapidly changing

[39:41 - 39:46]
to match uh the needs of of this

[39:44 - 39:49]
expanding Market um of course learning

[39:46 - 39:50]
how to work with containers I think is

[39:49 - 39:53]
very very valuable there's a few

[39:50 - 39:56]
different solutions not just open AI Opa

[39:53 - 39:58]
but uh Nvidia has one called Nvidia

[39:56 - 40:01]
workbench

[39:58 - 40:03]
um I I would just say like there's not I

[40:01 - 40:04]
haven't seen much tooling around

[40:03 - 40:07]
containers and k8s and when I've talked

[40:04 - 40:09]
to folks in the kubernetes uh or Cloud

[40:07 - 40:11]
native Community they're all like I know

[40:09 - 40:12]
containers really well but I don't know

[40:11 - 40:15]
anything about J and I'm like but you

[40:12 - 40:17]
know containers right um and I think

[40:15 - 40:20]
that um those that know how to work with

[40:17 - 40:23]
containers that uh they they might have

[40:20 - 40:25]
um uh an extra Edge if you will for

[40:23 - 40:26]
deploying things into production and we

[40:25 - 40:30]
definitely need people that know how to

[40:26 - 40:32]
do that so serving models I think um uh

[40:30 - 40:33]
is is also very useful it's it's

[40:32 - 40:37]
unbelievable how many ways you can serve

[40:33 - 40:39]
a model just as web servers have servers

[40:37 - 40:44]
uh llms have servers and I also assume

[40:39 - 40:46]
that um um General models have servers

[40:44 - 40:48]
um but I here's a a small list of things

[40:46 - 40:50]
in fact I covered I don't think I

[40:48 - 40:52]
covered P LM but there was a few other

[40:50 - 40:55]
ones that I I covered um do you have to

[40:52 - 40:58]
deal with uh serving models uh very

[40:55 - 41:00]
often or uh uh what what does serving

[40:58 - 41:02]
models look like for you Rola yeah so

[41:00 - 41:04]
when you when you put a model out for

[41:02 - 41:06]
usage people have to we call it

[41:04 - 41:08]
inference or survey you have to put it

[41:06 - 41:10]
on a machine for people to Ping that

[41:08 - 41:12]
machine and and get their answers and

[41:10 - 41:14]
but we tend to do a lot of things native

[41:12 - 41:19]
to AWS so you can do that through Sage

[41:14 - 41:21]
maker and Bedrock quite nicely so um but

[41:19 - 41:24]
yeah if if you want to put it off the

[41:21 - 41:27]
out of the cloud or use your own

[41:24 - 41:28]
Solutions then yes but the main point is

[41:27 - 41:31]
to actually serve the model right that's

[41:28 - 41:33]
how you make it public and and

[41:31 - 41:35]
usable yeah and I think I think with all

[41:33 - 41:37]
major providers with with their specific

[41:35 - 41:40]
uh ml platforms that they have their own

[41:37 - 41:41]
their own uh inference engines or

[41:40 - 41:44]
whatever you want to call them and I

[41:41 - 41:45]
remember the one for sage maker uh yeah

[41:44 - 41:47]
these ones these ones are really

[41:45 - 41:49]
interesting as well Ray I I really stood

[41:47 - 41:51]
out to me because it allows you to do

[41:49 - 41:53]
things distributed um so I didn't

[41:51 - 41:56]
realize that a lot of these things were

[41:53 - 41:58]
um that only serve on a single machine

[41:56 - 42:00]
and you have to in do something like Ray

[41:58 - 42:02]
to take BLM and then spread it across

[42:00 - 42:05]
machines which was really interesting uh

[42:02 - 42:07]
there's model optimization um so I have

[42:05 - 42:09]
a few here a few things here listed um

[42:07 - 42:10]
stuff keeps shifting around here there's

[42:09 - 42:12]
another one here I don't know think I

[42:10 - 42:15]
covered it but again merging stuff but

[42:12 - 42:17]
it was called like webn or

[42:15 - 42:19]
something webn or something I can't

[42:17 - 42:22]
remember what was called but it was a

[42:19 - 42:24]
Microsoft project um and so that stuff's

[42:22 - 42:25]
changing all the time but one thing that

[42:24 - 42:27]
I I thought that might be really

[42:25 - 42:30]
important is understanding the

[42:27 - 42:33]
underlying uh uh Hardware um I think

[42:30 - 42:35]
that um we really don't know what

[42:33 - 42:38]
direction uh the Gen at least I don't

[42:35 - 42:41]
know maybe R you know but the the the

[42:38 - 42:42]
direction of of what it looks like to

[42:41 - 42:45]
build a workload right and and what do

[42:42 - 42:47]
you need to do that like uh because I

[42:45 - 42:49]
know there's different levels of of

[42:47 - 42:52]
models and inference and so I in my mind

[42:49 - 42:55]
I think of it as like lightweight medium

[42:52 - 42:58]
and heavyduty uh inference and training

[42:55 - 43:01]
and so when I say that I mean like if I

[42:58 - 43:05]
have a a computer like a modern computer

[43:01 - 43:08]
and it can run a uh let's say a seven

[43:05 - 43:09]
billion parameter model uh that's like a

[43:08 - 43:11]
light that could be a light workload

[43:09 - 43:12]
something that that is feasible that I

[43:11 - 43:15]
could run or something that could end up

[43:12 - 43:18]
on my phone one day and so I think okay

[43:15 - 43:21]
what does that do for the end end

[43:18 - 43:24]
business or customer if now they can run

[43:21 - 43:26]
this size of model locally right like

[43:24 - 43:28]
and you and you have this one Capital

[43:26 - 43:30]
cost of like a TH or $2,000 machine and

[43:28 - 43:32]
now you can build a workload that's

[43:30 - 43:34]
that's scoped only for your office and

[43:32 - 43:37]
is that a benefit to anybody and so

[43:34 - 43:41]
because the stuff becomes is becoming

[43:37 - 43:43]
more and more possible to run on uh on

[43:41 - 43:44]
our devices and stuff like that I keep

[43:43 - 43:47]
thinking well we need to know a little

[43:44 - 43:48]
bit more about this right um uh but I

[43:47 - 43:51]
don't know if you have any thoughts

[43:48 - 43:53]
about uh the hardware side of it or I

[43:51 - 43:55]
mean the hardware side is interesting

[43:53 - 43:58]
because these models are so large that

[43:55 - 44:00]
they push the limit of what we know

[43:58 - 44:02]
about Hardware right so we can we're

[44:00 - 44:04]
going to talk a little bit about model

[44:02 - 44:08]
sizes and what that means for running

[44:04 - 44:11]
them and and so understanding

[44:08 - 44:13]
how these models have pushed our need

[44:11 - 44:16]
for custommade chips and things like

[44:13 - 44:20]
that is fairly interesting and um and

[44:16 - 44:24]
like you said having Edge um compatible

[44:20 - 44:26]
or Edge optimized models can change

[44:24 - 44:27]
applications in in our world as we know

[44:26 - 44:30]
it and I think we've seen we saw a lot

[44:27 - 44:34]
of different phones this year with their

[44:30 - 44:35]
main catch being that AI now runs on

[44:34 - 44:40]
your phone right

[44:35 - 44:43]
so Edge um gen on edge is is predicted

[44:40 - 44:46]
to be a very very lucrative and big

[44:43 - 44:48]
Trend well it it'll be very interesting

[44:46 - 44:50]
to to to see what happens and just the

[44:48 - 44:53]
other thing is just understanding how

[44:50 - 44:56]
much resources these things take because

[44:53 - 44:57]
when you see or you can uh kind of think

[44:56 - 44:59]
about how much it takes takes and then

[44:57 - 45:01]
you might ask like how is this

[44:59 - 45:02]
sustainable and what's going to happen

[45:01 - 45:03]
to some of these uh services that are

[45:02 - 45:06]
out there and how are they going to make

[45:03 - 45:08]
a profit um and you know if I do invest

[45:06 - 45:09]
my time and effort should I go with this

[45:08 - 45:12]
or should I go with something that is

[45:09 - 45:14]
more feasible that I can run on at this

[45:12 - 45:16]
size and so uh it's really hard to say I

[45:14 - 45:17]
was talking to one of my friends and I'm

[45:16 - 45:19]
sure they're going to be really

[45:17 - 45:21]
interested in the boot camp um because

[45:19 - 45:22]
they're that's that's they're really

[45:21 - 45:24]
excited for the boot camp and

[45:22 - 45:25]
specifically the hardware side and and

[45:24 - 45:27]
they wanted to go and spend a bunch of

[45:25 - 45:28]
money because they wanted to build a

[45:27 - 45:31]
home lab because they don't want to get

[45:28 - 45:33]
the the the rug pulled on them so to

[45:31 - 45:35]
speak that the price is going to go

[45:33 - 45:37]
really high and now they have this uh

[45:35 - 45:39]
service that becomes like essential for

[45:37 - 45:40]
their for their dailies and so um

[45:39 - 45:42]
they're trying to invest in that so I

[45:40 - 45:43]
thought that that was an important

[45:42 - 45:46]
inclusion of it whether I did a good job

[45:43 - 45:48]
on that is is up to the folks that are

[45:46 - 45:50]
watching but hopefully uh it is good

[45:48 - 45:52]
then we're getting into more advanced

[45:50 - 45:54]
territory and basically everything below

[45:52 - 45:56]
this line I mean Onyx probably is below

[45:54 - 45:57]
this line too but everything below this

[45:56 - 46:00]
line is more I would describe as

[45:57 - 46:01]
Advanced Techniques um though to be fair

[46:00 - 46:02]
if you're going to be deploying models

[46:01 - 46:04]
you're probably going to want to have

[46:02 - 46:06]
evaluations and guard rails and things

[46:04 - 46:09]
like that but I don't know I think all

[46:06 - 46:11]
this stuff is um and maybe this is the

[46:09 - 46:13]
stuff that I didn't get to cover much in

[46:11 - 46:16]
detail this is probably where um I've

[46:13 - 46:17]
done the the the poorest job in in this

[46:16 - 46:19]
this course but maybe that should be its

[46:17 - 46:22]
own course because all these things are

[46:19 - 46:26]
uh very involved at least I think they

[46:22 - 46:29]
are um but uh do you think that uh folks

[46:26 - 46:30]
that are becoming Engineers or or maybe

[46:29 - 46:31]
not AI Engineers but they're picking up

[46:30 - 46:33]
these generative AI skills for their

[46:31 - 46:35]
companies do they need to learn super

[46:33 - 46:37]
fine tuning like know how to do it or

[46:35 - 46:40]
just uh like actually be able to do it

[46:37 - 46:43]
or just know of

[46:40 - 46:45]
it um I think knowing of it is always a

[46:43 - 46:47]
good thing I think it depends on the

[46:45 - 46:49]
field you're in if you are in a general

[46:47 - 46:51]
field then these models are advancing

[46:49 - 46:54]
fast enough that you might not have to

[46:51 - 46:57]
do it on your own but if you're in a uh

[46:54 - 47:01]
Niche field where the model

[46:57 - 47:03]
needs to be fine-tuned on your specific

[47:01 - 47:06]
field of data then probably you need to

[47:03 - 47:08]
know but if you're in a general company

[47:06 - 47:11]
general use case scenario just knowing

[47:08 - 47:13]
it is exists is probably enough at this

[47:11 - 47:15]
point I think the only thing that might

[47:13 - 47:19]
be missing from this is all the general

[47:15 - 47:21]
data skills that you need and um uh I

[47:19 - 47:23]
guess I just maybe it needs its own data

[47:21 - 47:24]
primer I think I might have put some

[47:23 - 47:26]
data in the course I think I had some

[47:24 - 47:28]
data data content there but I don't have

[47:26 - 47:31]
any data specific video saying like this

[47:28 - 47:35]
is how you prepare data for for ML

[47:31 - 47:37]
models or llm models um how important is

[47:35 - 47:39]
data to your models does it matter the

[47:37 - 47:41]
data that you put in your models you're

[47:39 - 47:43]
asking me how important data is forl

[47:41 - 47:44]
models is that your question I know is

[47:43 - 47:46]
it like well I'm just saying like well

[47:44 - 47:48]
I'm just saying like imagine you wanted

[47:46 - 47:50]
you have something you're like oh I want

[47:48 - 47:52]
to train a model and I wanted to do

[47:50 - 47:54]
something is 20 lines good enough like

[47:52 - 47:58]
how much how much time do you need to

[47:54 - 48:01]
spend on data comparing comparative to

[47:58 - 48:04]
uh comparative to actually um

[48:01 - 48:09]
engineering llm

[48:04 - 48:13]
Solutions so um I think let's start with

[48:09 - 48:14]
regular uh ml before llm data is the

[48:13 - 48:18]
bread and butter of machine learning

[48:14 - 48:21]
right if the model learns from data um

[48:18 - 48:24]
and then and so the data has to be there

[48:21 - 48:27]
it has to be of good enough quality and

[48:24 - 48:30]
it has to be um pretty consistent then

[48:27 - 48:34]
and so that the model learns um from it

[48:30 - 48:36]
now in terms of llm specifically it's

[48:34 - 48:38]
less of an issue on you it's not an it

[48:36 - 48:40]
is an issue for the model of course

[48:38 - 48:42]
because it's still learning it's less of

[48:40 - 48:45]
an issue on you because the model

[48:42 - 48:46]
provider of that foundational model has

[48:45 - 48:49]
done all the work and unless you need to

[48:46 - 48:54]
fine-tune it or change anything about it

[48:49 - 48:56]
or make it more uh you know for your

[48:54 - 49:00]
field you don't need to worry about it

[48:56 - 49:03]
right because it fine-tuning llms is

[49:00 - 49:08]
more a privilege than um not everybody

[49:03 - 49:11]
can do it uh how much data are these uh

[49:08 - 49:14]
things trained on well in the in the

[49:11 - 49:18]
words of Yun who is one of the pioneers

[49:14 - 49:21]
of uh deep learning and machine learning

[49:18 - 49:23]
um it take 20,000 years for me and you

[49:21 - 49:26]
to read That's how much data these

[49:23 - 49:27]
things get to see before they become

[49:26 - 49:31]
useful

[49:27 - 49:34]
uh so can you and I sit down and curate

[49:31 - 49:37]
a data set

[49:34 - 49:39]
tomorrow maybe if we commit a few months

[49:37 - 49:40]
to it but it's not it's not for the

[49:39 - 49:43]
faint of

[49:40 - 49:45]
heart I I I kind of Wonder like with

[49:43 - 49:47]
data sets at large how do they know

[49:45 - 49:49]
what's good and bad data when they have

[49:47 - 49:52]
to consume that much data or I guess it

[49:49 - 49:54]
just kind of evens out eh no well that's

[49:52 - 49:55]
the thing is is we're seeing all sorts

[49:54 - 49:58]
of things and we see and and we see

[49:55 - 49:59]
biases a lot of the data is also scraped

[49:58 - 50:01]
off the internet right there's biases in

[49:59 - 50:03]
them we're seeing these models being

[50:01 - 50:06]
biased they they are perpetuating social

[50:03 - 50:08]
bias because these days the sets are not

[50:06 - 50:09]
necessarily cleaned it's it's also

[50:08 - 50:12]
really important to know what data sets

[50:09 - 50:14]
the models have been trained on I think

[50:12 - 50:16]
I was looking at some of the Google

[50:14 - 50:19]
models I can't remember which one but

[50:16 - 50:21]
it's something to the tune of 40% of the

[50:19 - 50:25]
data is from social media right like

[50:21 - 50:27]
that's thing that's not good that's not

[50:25 - 50:30]
good right there not good at all curate

[50:27 - 50:32]
social media data there's nobody who

[50:30 - 50:35]
there's biases in social media data

[50:32 - 50:37]
there's no accuracy so what data and and

[50:35 - 50:39]
that's the important part for example

[50:37 - 50:42]
between open source versus open weight

[50:39 - 50:47]
models is that there's more transparency

[50:42 - 50:50]
over the data that the model has seen um

[50:47 - 50:54]
and so if you have a chance to look at

[50:50 - 50:55]
what percentage of uh social media data

[50:54 - 50:57]
what percentage of literature what

[50:55 - 50:59]
percentage of of Science and like

[50:57 - 51:01]
whatever the breakdown of the data

[50:59 - 51:04]
content that the model has seen will

[51:01 - 51:08]
give you a better understanding of that

[51:04 - 51:10]
what what I what that model looks like

[51:08 - 51:12]
right uh it's like it's like looking at

[51:10 - 51:14]
somebody and saying did this person go

[51:12 - 51:16]
to college or they they spend 10 years

[51:14 - 51:18]
on social media that could be a model

[51:16 - 51:20]
right depending on what sources it saw

[51:18 - 51:22]
yeah I I just think of the movie uh and

[51:20 - 51:23]
for those that have not seen it uh you

[51:22 - 51:27]
might want to see it there's a movie

[51:23 - 51:28]
called idiocracy uh where um it's oh R

[51:27 - 51:30]
do you know the movie my husband likes

[51:28 - 51:32]
that movie there's a there's a really

[51:30 - 51:33]
good line in there I always forget it's

[51:32 - 51:36]
uh

[51:33 - 51:39]
it's Bravo or bra it's the the quench

[51:36 - 51:41]
you anyway it's the product that's in

[51:39 - 51:42]
the the movie but uh yeah it's a bit

[51:41 - 51:45]
scary to think like that they're

[51:42 - 51:49]
scraping social media data but even even

[51:45 - 51:50]
um again I think there's a lot of data

[51:49 - 51:52]
it's just it's just it's interesting to

[51:50 - 51:54]
me but anyway I just wanted to show

[51:52 - 51:57]
people the road map to give an idea of

[51:54 - 51:59]
of the scope of it um hopefully that

[51:57 - 52:02]
gives uh people an idea of the

[51:59 - 52:04]
boundaries or or scope of Genera AI this

[52:02 - 52:06]
stuff can be a lot more complicated so I

[52:04 - 52:10]
did my best to um simplify it and break

[52:06 - 52:12]
it down um but uh in reality if this was

[52:10 - 52:14]
if this was graphed properly things

[52:12 - 52:17]
would be all interconnected all over the

[52:14 - 52:20]
place um and and and I made it look like

[52:17 - 52:22]
a journey through one step whereas it's

[52:20 - 52:23]
really all over the place uh or if

[52:22 - 52:26]
anyone's ever played the the video game

[52:23 - 52:27]
p the Exile um which has like a skill

[52:26 - 52:31]
tree

[52:27 - 52:34]
um there's the pth to Exile skill

[52:31 - 52:35]
tree I feel like it would look more more

[52:34 - 52:37]
like something like that if I click into

[52:35 - 52:39]
here and it's just all over the place

[52:37 - 52:41]
that's kind of what geni um yeah here it

[52:39 - 52:43]
is you go here and it's just it goes

[52:41 - 52:44]
everywhere right and so I feel that if

[52:43 - 52:46]
we did it like that it would look like

[52:44 - 52:49]
that and people would be like I'm done

[52:46 - 52:52]
but um I think that uh this is a a fair

[52:49 - 52:53]
compromise here uh thank you Rola for

[52:52 - 52:55]
helping us here in the road map uh for

[52:53 - 52:58]
folks that are watching Rola is going to

[52:55 - 53:03]
show up in a few other videos here uh

[52:58 - 53:03]
and um yeah that's about it CIA

[53:04 - 53:10]
[Music]

[53:07 - 53:12]
Chow hey this is angrew brown I just

[53:10 - 53:14]
wanted to point out that there are some

[53:12 - 53:16]
areas that I wasn't able to fully record

[53:14 - 53:18]
um just because of time constraints but

[53:16 - 53:20]
also there's just other really good

[53:18 - 53:22]
resources out there that you can utilize

[53:20 - 53:25]
um to fill any gaps that you need before

[53:22 - 53:26]
the Boot Camp starts or to uh make sure

[53:25 - 53:29]
that you're successful if you're trying

[53:26 - 53:31]
to get the certification for the uh the

[53:29 - 53:34]
Gen Essentials course uh so I've

[53:31 - 53:37]
compiled a list along with free camp at

[53:34 - 53:40]
gen. cloudro bootcamp.com boo forre Camp

[53:37 - 53:42]
of a bunch of resources and we probably

[53:40 - 53:45]
will keep adding to this list of things

[53:42 - 53:47]
that you could utilize um uh uh utilize

[53:45 - 53:48]
to fill in those gaps so for example

[53:47 - 53:51]
fine tuning was something I didn't get

[53:48 - 53:53]
to do a whole lot about if you go over

[53:51 - 53:56]
to here you can see that there are ones

[53:53 - 53:57]
on fine tuning right uh or uh you know

[53:56 - 53:59]
Google's offering I didn't get to do a

[53:57 - 54:00]
whole lot about but there's tons of

[53:59 - 54:02]
things about here with the Google

[54:00 - 54:05]
offering some of these are my videos as

[54:02 - 54:07]
well and so you know I'm just suggesting

[54:05 - 54:10]
you to uh take whatever you can to

[54:07 - 54:13]
prepare um and that list is here at the

[54:10 - 54:15]
gen. cloudro bootcamp.com boooth slf

[54:13 - 54:19]
freeco Camp so there you

[54:15 - 54:21]
[Music]

[54:19 - 54:23]
go hey this is Andrew Brown and we are

[54:21 - 54:26]
taking a look at the definition of what

[54:23 - 54:28]
is artificial intelligence and we really

[54:26 - 54:30]
wanted to put this against uh the terms

[54:28 - 54:32]
of machine learning deep learning and

[54:30 - 54:35]
generative AI so that it's very clear

[54:32 - 54:37]
what the differences are often people

[54:35 - 54:39]
just say AI when they mean ml or deep

[54:37 - 54:43]
learning so understand that um these

[54:39 - 54:44]
terms are uh not used correctly often

[54:43 - 54:46]
but people generally will understand

[54:44 - 54:48]
what you're trying to say so it's not a

[54:46 - 54:49]
big deal if you use them out of turn but

[54:48 - 54:51]
let's make sure that we know what they

[54:49 - 54:53]
are let's so let's first take a look

[54:51 - 54:55]
here at artificial intelligence also

[54:53 - 55:00]
known as AI these are machines that

[54:55 - 55:03]
perform jobs that mimic human behavior

[55:00 - 55:05]
okay that's the key thing here is that

[55:03 - 55:09]
they are human like or doing tasks that

[55:05 - 55:11]
you'd expect a human to do um and that

[55:09 - 55:13]
is clearly a very broad term of what is

[55:11 - 55:16]
AI and so you can see why a lot of

[55:13 - 55:18]
things are attributed to being AI then

[55:16 - 55:22]
you have machine learning and machine

[55:18 - 55:24]
learning initialized as ml is machines

[55:22 - 55:27]
that get better at a task without

[55:24 - 55:30]
explicit programming now now of course

[55:27 - 55:32]
we have to code a machine learning model

[55:30 - 55:34]
but once we have that model and we pass

[55:32 - 55:38]
things into it it's able to complete its

[55:34 - 55:40]
task with its very complex algorithms um

[55:38 - 55:42]
so you could also just think of it as an

[55:40 - 55:46]
uh it's a a a special algorithm to

[55:42 - 55:48]
perform a task that would negate you the

[55:46 - 55:51]
negate you having to do calculations or

[55:48 - 55:53]
programming or things like that then we

[55:51 - 55:55]
have what is deep learning and when we

[55:53 - 55:57]
think of a lot of the AI stuff we're

[55:55 - 55:59]
usually think of deep learning because

[55:57 - 56:02]
it's these machines that have an

[55:59 - 56:04]
artificial neural network inspired by

[56:02 - 56:07]
the human brain to solve complex

[56:04 - 56:08]
problems so you probably have this uh

[56:07 - 56:09]
you probably seen a graphic of it of

[56:08 - 56:10]
like these nodes and they're

[56:09 - 56:13]
interconnected and they go through

[56:10 - 56:15]
layers that's deep learning a lot of

[56:13 - 56:17]
people call that machine learning or AI

[56:15 - 56:21]
but no that's that's the L then we have

[56:17 - 56:23]
gen so gen which is more of a u

[56:21 - 56:25]
marketing term but generative AI is a

[56:23 - 56:28]
specialized subset of AI that generates

[56:25 - 56:30]
out uh content such as images video text

[56:28 - 56:32]
and audio now I don't have it in the

[56:30 - 56:35]
graphic on the left because it's hard to

[56:32 - 56:37]
say where does it go does it go here

[56:35 - 56:41]
right because it is a subset of AI but

[56:37 - 56:43]
technically um gen often utilizes deep

[56:41 - 56:46]
learning because when we think of it and

[56:43 - 56:47]
my Line's not dry here today but um when

[56:46 - 56:50]
we think of it there we go there's the

[56:47 - 56:53]
line is that a lot of gen techniques

[56:50 - 56:55]
like large language models or um or um

[56:53 - 56:57]
Vision models things like that are

[56:55 - 56:59]
utilizing neural networks so it is deep

[56:57 - 57:03]
learning

[56:59 - 57:06]
[Music]

[57:03 - 57:08]
okay all right so I know we keep talking

[57:06 - 57:09]
about what is AI what is Gen AI but

[57:08 - 57:11]
we're going to cover it again just so

[57:09 - 57:14]
that it becomes more clear from

[57:11 - 57:17]
different perspectives um so let's talk

[57:14 - 57:20]
about what is artificial intelligence so

[57:17 - 57:23]
AI is computer systems that perform

[57:20 - 57:25]
tasks typically requiring human

[57:23 - 57:28]
intelligence um so these include things

[57:25 - 57:30]
like problem solving decision making

[57:28 - 57:32]
understanding natural language

[57:30 - 57:35]
recognizing speech and images and an

[57:32 - 57:39]
ai's goal is to interpret analyze and

[57:35 - 57:42]
respond to human actions it's there to

[57:39 - 57:43]
simulate human intelligence in machines

[57:42 - 57:46]
when we use the word simulate we're

[57:43 - 57:48]
talking about mimics aspects resembles

[57:46 - 57:51]
behaviors but what we're not talking

[57:48 - 57:54]
about is emulation which is replicating

[57:51 - 57:56]
exact processes and mechanisms as if you

[57:54 - 57:59]
created literally a virtual human brain

[57:56 - 58:01]
that's what emulation would be um so AI

[57:59 - 58:04]
applications are vast and include areas

[58:01 - 58:07]
such as expert systems natural language

[58:04 - 58:11]
processing also known as NLP speech

[58:07 - 58:13]
recognition robotics uh and more AI is

[58:11 - 58:16]
using various Industries for tasks such

[58:13 - 58:18]
as uh we're talking about business to

[58:16 - 58:20]
Consumer so think of a customer service

[58:18 - 58:22]
chatbot if we're looking at e-commerce

[58:20 - 58:24]
think of a recommendation system if

[58:22 - 58:26]
we're talking about the Auto industry uh

[58:24 - 58:29]
maybe we're looking at a atomous

[58:26 - 58:31]
Vehicles if it's medical then medical

[58:29 - 58:35]
diagnosis there's a lot of applications

[58:31 - 58:37]
for AI but it's a broad application for

[58:35 - 58:40]
all sorts of things now let's take a

[58:37 - 58:44]
look at generative AI so generative AI

[58:40 - 58:47]
uh often initialized as geni or or said

[58:44 - 58:51]
as geni is a subset of AI that focuses

[58:47 - 58:53]
on creating new content or data that is

[58:51 - 58:56]
novel and realistic it can interpret or

[58:53 - 58:59]
analyze data but also generate new data

[58:56 - 59:01]
itself it often uh yeah so like types of

[58:59 - 59:03]
content produces would be text images

[59:01 - 59:05]
music speech and other forms of media it

[59:03 - 59:07]
often involves Advanced machine learning

[59:05 - 59:10]
techniques uh so it could be using

[59:07 - 59:15]
things like Gans it could be using vae

[59:10 - 59:18]
so variational Auto encoders um a lot of

[59:15 - 59:20]
current llms use the Transformer

[59:18 - 59:24]
architecture so if you're using um chat

[59:20 - 59:26]
GPT or Claud Sonet or any of the popular

[59:24 - 59:29]
ones they're basically all Transformer

[59:26 - 59:32]
architectures uh gener I has multiple

[59:29 - 59:34]
modalities and when we say modalities

[59:32 - 59:37]
it's like think about your your senses

[59:34 - 59:40]
you have touch taste hearing smell so

[59:37 - 59:44]
modalities are the kinds of content or

[59:40 - 59:46]
or um senses that a model has so we have

[59:44 - 59:49]
Vision so realistic images and videos

[59:46 - 59:52]
text generating humanlike text audio

[59:49 - 59:54]
composing music molecular which is more

[59:52 - 59:58]
of an interesting one so drug Discovery

[59:54 - 59:59]
via geomic data and uh I want to make it

[59:58 - 01:00:02]
clear again we're talking about large

[59:59 - 01:00:05]
language models but llms large language

[01:00:02 - 01:00:08]
models will generate out humanlike text

[01:00:05 - 01:00:11]
and is a subset of gen it's just one

[01:00:08 - 01:00:14]
modality of the many modalities um but

[01:00:11 - 01:00:17]
it's often conflated as being AI or gen

[01:00:14 - 01:00:19]
AI just because it's the most popular

[01:00:17 - 01:00:21]
and In Demand right now and the most

[01:00:19 - 01:00:24]
developed so just make sure that you

[01:00:21 - 01:00:26]
understand that gen and AI is not all

[01:00:24 - 01:00:31]
about large language model it's just one

[01:00:26 - 01:00:33]
modality one application of of the broad

[01:00:31 - 01:00:36]
sense of AI and gen now let's just make

[01:00:33 - 01:00:37]
sure we have a side by-side comparison

[01:00:36 - 01:00:39]
uh and then I'm sure after this you'll

[01:00:37 - 01:00:42]
definitely know uh definitively the

[01:00:39 - 01:00:44]
difference between Ai and geni so in

[01:00:42 - 01:00:46]
terms of functionality AI focuses on

[01:00:44 - 01:00:49]
understanding and decision making

[01:00:46 - 01:00:52]
whereas geni is about creating new and

[01:00:49 - 01:00:54]
original outputs for data handling AI

[01:00:52 - 01:00:58]
analyzes and makes decisions based on

[01:00:54 - 01:01:01]
existing data geni uses existing data to

[01:00:58 - 01:01:04]
generate new and unseen outputs in terms

[01:01:01 - 01:01:06]
of applications AI spans across various

[01:01:04 - 01:01:10]
sectors including data analysis

[01:01:06 - 01:01:13]
automation NLP and Healthcare where gen

[01:01:10 - 01:01:15]
and yes I see the spelling mistake uh

[01:01:13 - 01:01:17]
it's creative and Innovative focusing on

[01:01:15 - 01:01:21]
content creation synthetic data

[01:01:17 - 01:01:24]
generation defix and design so there you

[01:01:21 - 01:01:27]
[Music]

[01:01:24 - 01:01:28]
go let's talk talk about Jupiter so

[01:01:27 - 01:01:30]
Jupiter notebook is a web-based

[01:01:28 - 01:01:32]
application for authoring documents that

[01:01:30 - 01:01:34]
combin live code narrative text

[01:01:32 - 01:01:36]
equations and visualizations and before

[01:01:34 - 01:01:39]
it was called jupyter notebook it was

[01:01:36 - 01:01:41]
known as I IPython notebook and jupyter

[01:01:39 - 01:01:44]
notebooks were overhauled and then

[01:01:41 - 01:01:46]
turned into an ID called Jupiter lab

[01:01:44 - 01:01:47]
which we'll talk about here in a moment

[01:01:46 - 01:01:51]
but you generally want to open notebooks

[01:01:47 - 01:01:53]
in Labs um and the leg the Legacy

[01:01:51 - 01:01:56]
web-based interface is known as Jupiter

[01:01:53 - 01:01:59]
classic notebook and to be honest

[01:01:56 - 01:02:02]
I get confused between Jupiter lab and

[01:01:59 - 01:02:04]
classic I think most things that use

[01:02:02 - 01:02:07]
these days are Jupiter lab um but the

[01:02:04 - 01:02:09]
confusion is because we just call them

[01:02:07 - 01:02:12]
notebooks even though Jupiter classic

[01:02:09 - 01:02:14]
notebook is the not note the uh the

[01:02:12 - 01:02:16]
older one and the newer one is Jupiter

[01:02:14 - 01:02:17]
Labs let's go take a look at jupyter

[01:02:16 - 01:02:20]
Labs so jupyter lab is the next

[01:02:17 - 01:02:22]
Generation webbased user interface it

[01:02:20 - 01:02:24]
has all the similar features as the

[01:02:22 - 01:02:27]
classic jup notebook in a flexible and

[01:02:24 - 01:02:30]
more powerful use interface so it has

[01:02:27 - 01:02:33]
notebooks terminals text editor file

[01:02:30 - 01:02:34]
browser uh Rich outputs and the way you

[01:02:33 - 01:02:37]
I think that you know that you're using

[01:02:34 - 01:02:38]
Jupiter lab is that will have this uh

[01:02:37 - 01:02:40]
these tabs here on the side and a bunch

[01:02:38 - 01:02:42]
of functionality so Jupiter lab will

[01:02:40 - 01:02:46]
eventually replace the classic jupyter

[01:02:42 - 01:02:48]
notebook and that's kind of true because

[01:02:46 - 01:02:50]
um but not fully because in some places

[01:02:48 - 01:02:52]
I do come across classic notebooks

[01:02:50 - 01:02:56]
launching them up um but for the most

[01:02:52 - 01:02:57]
part functionally it has been replaced

[01:02:56 - 01:03:00]
then we have Jupiter Hub so jupyter Hub

[01:02:57 - 01:03:02]
is a server to run jupyter labs for

[01:03:00 - 01:03:04]
multiple users it's intended for a class

[01:03:02 - 01:03:06]
of students a corporate data science

[01:03:04 - 01:03:09]
group scientific research groups and so

[01:03:06 - 01:03:11]
it has some components uh underneath you

[01:03:09 - 01:03:14]
will come across notebook like

[01:03:11 - 01:03:17]
experiences that are like Jupiter Labs

[01:03:14 - 01:03:20]
so some companies will um extend the

[01:03:17 - 01:03:22]
functionality of it one example is Sage

[01:03:20 - 01:03:25]
maker uh Studio Classic for whatever

[01:03:22 - 01:03:27]
reason adab us um spent all this time

[01:03:25 - 01:03:30]
creating extensions and extending

[01:03:27 - 01:03:31]
Jupiter lab and then they decided uh no

[01:03:30 - 01:03:32]
we're not going to have extensions

[01:03:31 - 01:03:36]
anymore and we're just going to use the

[01:03:32 - 01:03:38]
vanilla version um but uh there's also

[01:03:36 - 01:03:42]
things like vs code that has notebooks

[01:03:38 - 01:03:44]
or code lab that have notebooks and vs

[01:03:42 - 01:03:46]
code is like its own kind of notebook

[01:03:44 - 01:03:48]
thing it's not juper Labs but it's jupit

[01:03:46 - 01:03:49]
lab compatible so just understand that

[01:03:48 - 01:03:51]
you'll come across things that are

[01:03:49 - 01:03:54]
notebooks that look like Jupiter lab but

[01:03:51 - 01:03:59]
they're not necessarily Jupiter lab okay

[01:03:54 - 01:04:01]
[Music]

[01:03:59 - 01:04:03]
let's take a look at natural language

[01:04:01 - 01:04:05]
processing also known as NLP and in

[01:04:03 - 01:04:08]
machine learning it's a technique that

[01:04:05 - 01:04:11]
can understand the context of a corpus a

[01:04:08 - 01:04:14]
corpus is a body of related text the

[01:04:11 - 01:04:16]
text that you are working with and NLP

[01:04:14 - 01:04:19]
intersects with computer science and

[01:04:16 - 01:04:22]
Linguistics so if you know a lot about

[01:04:19 - 01:04:25]
the the nature of uh spoken and written

[01:04:22 - 01:04:26]
language then uh computer science here

[01:04:25 - 01:04:29]
is going to meet in the middle here so

[01:04:26 - 01:04:32]
that we can um make sense of it using

[01:04:29 - 01:04:34]
algorithms so NLP enables us to do

[01:04:32 - 01:04:36]
things like analyze and interpret text

[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]
within documents emails and messages

[01:04:36 - 01:04:41]
interpret or contextualize spoken texts

[01:04:38 - 01:04:43]
like sentiment analysis synthesize

[01:04:41 - 01:04:45]
speech uh such as using a voice

[01:04:43 - 01:04:47]
assistant talking to you automatically

[01:04:45 - 01:04:50]
translate spoken or written phrases and

[01:04:47 - 01:04:52]
sentences between languages in uh

[01:04:50 - 01:04:53]
interpret spoken or written commands and

[01:04:52 - 01:04:55]
determine appropriate actions another

[01:04:53 - 01:04:57]
thing you'll hear a lot is language

[01:04:55 - 01:04:58]
understanding which is supposed to be

[01:04:57 - 01:05:03]
it's a it's more like a specialized

[01:04:58 - 01:05:05]
subset of NLP um uh that just goes

[01:05:03 - 01:05:07]
farther to understand uh more

[01:05:05 - 01:05:09]
traditional older ways of doing NLP but

[01:05:07 - 01:05:12]
uh anyway what I'll do is we'll just

[01:05:09 - 01:05:15]
take a look at this um very simple

[01:05:12 - 01:05:18]
flowchart to give you some idea of

[01:05:15 - 01:05:19]
things that are related with an NLP this

[01:05:18 - 01:05:21]
is mostly just to get you exposed to

[01:05:19 - 01:05:22]
some terms it's not important to

[01:05:21 - 01:05:25]
remember what these are and I can't even

[01:05:22 - 01:05:27]
describe them off the top of my head um

[01:05:25 - 01:05:28]
but again just you exposure to NLP terms

[01:05:27 - 01:05:30]
so that when you see them later you'll

[01:05:28 - 01:05:32]
go look up and be like I remember seeing

[01:05:30 - 01:05:34]
that term here so here we have like text

[01:05:32 - 01:05:36]
wrangling pre-processing language

[01:05:34 - 01:05:38]
understanding so structure and syntax

[01:05:36 - 01:05:40]
processing functionality which is what

[01:05:38 - 01:05:43]
the NLP uh does for you in the end but

[01:05:40 - 01:05:48]
text text R pre-processing is where you

[01:05:43 - 01:05:50]
are preparing uh text to be uh put into

[01:05:48 - 01:05:52]
possibly um a machine learning model or

[01:05:50 - 01:05:54]
maybe you're using it for um some kind

[01:05:52 - 01:05:58]
of analysis or something like that and

[01:05:54 - 01:06:00]
so this is basically taking text and um

[01:05:58 - 01:06:01]
formatting it changing it and so what

[01:06:00 - 01:06:03]
could we be doing here well we could be

[01:06:01 - 01:06:05]
doing conversions maybe we're lower

[01:06:03 - 01:06:07]
casing things maybe we're upper casing

[01:06:05 - 01:06:10]
things um maybe we're turning

[01:06:07 - 01:06:13]
contractions into their full forms or

[01:06:10 - 01:06:16]
vice versa sanitation this is where you

[01:06:13 - 01:06:18]
are maybe stripping out HTML or special

[01:06:16 - 01:06:20]
characters or you are removing stop

[01:06:18 - 01:06:24]
wordss when uh you have stop wordss

[01:06:20 - 01:06:28]
later on in your ml models tokenization

[01:06:24 - 01:06:31]
which is converting um the text into uh

[01:06:28 - 01:06:34]
Vector embeddings we have stemming okay

[01:06:31 - 01:06:35]
we have uh lonization so there's a lot

[01:06:34 - 01:06:38]
of things here but you can see it's

[01:06:35 - 01:06:40]
mostly just like formatting the text to

[01:06:38 - 01:06:41]
be utilized for something else we have

[01:06:40 - 01:06:43]
language understanding so these are

[01:06:41 - 01:06:45]
processes to make sense of the text so

[01:06:43 - 01:06:47]
part of speech tagging so is this an

[01:06:45 - 01:06:50]
adjective is this a noun things like

[01:06:47 - 01:06:52]
that chunking how can we uh break up the

[01:06:50 - 01:06:54]
text and then work with those chunks

[01:06:52 - 01:06:57]
later on down the road so that it still

[01:06:54 - 01:06:59]
makes sense dependency parsing so you

[01:06:57 - 01:07:00]
know which word relies on other words

[01:06:59 - 01:07:02]
and what relationships do they have to

[01:07:00 - 01:07:06]
other ones uh

[01:07:02 - 01:07:10]
consti consu parsing very hard for word

[01:07:06 - 01:07:13]
for me to say but like imagine a um a a

[01:07:10 - 01:07:15]
tra tra green and so like you know a

[01:07:13 - 01:07:17]
noun has an adjective under it which has

[01:07:15 - 01:07:18]
another thing under it you look up if

[01:07:17 - 01:07:19]
you look it up and go to Google Images

[01:07:18 - 01:07:21]
you'll you'll know what I'm talking

[01:07:19 - 01:07:23]
about then we have processing

[01:07:21 - 01:07:25]
functionality what are we using NLP 4 so

[01:07:23 - 01:07:27]
we have name entity recognition this is

[01:07:25 - 01:07:29]
is where you have a body of text and

[01:07:27 - 01:07:31]
it's highlighting uh important words

[01:07:29 - 01:07:33]
like maybe important nouns that it

[01:07:31 - 01:07:34]
thinks you you care about or things like

[01:07:33 - 01:07:36]
that or personally identifiable

[01:07:34 - 01:07:39]
information we' got engrams sentiment

[01:07:36 - 01:07:41]
analysis is this text positive negative

[01:07:39 - 01:07:43]
happy sad information extraction what

[01:07:41 - 01:07:46]
are we trying to get out of a large body

[01:07:43 - 01:07:48]
of text um same thing with information

[01:07:46 - 01:07:51]
retrieval questioning and answering

[01:07:48 - 01:07:53]
topic modeling so you know again not

[01:07:51 - 01:07:55]
super important to know these in depth

[01:07:53 - 01:07:57]
right now but the things that are

[01:07:55 - 01:07:59]
important we will see these terms again

[01:07:57 - 01:08:00]
um and you'll know what they are then so

[01:07:59 - 01:08:03]
don't worry about trying to memorize

[01:08:00 - 01:08:05]
this now but just get that exposure to

[01:08:03 - 01:08:08]
NLP terms

[01:08:05 - 01:08:10]
[Music]

[01:08:08 - 01:08:12]
okay hey this is angrew brown and we're

[01:08:10 - 01:08:14]
looking at the concept of a regression

[01:08:12 - 01:08:15]
and this is a process of finding a

[01:08:14 - 01:08:18]
function to correlate a label data set

[01:08:15 - 01:08:20]
into a continuous variable or number uh

[01:08:18 - 01:08:22]
so imagine we need to predict a variable

[01:08:20 - 01:08:23]
in the future such as the weather what

[01:08:22 - 01:08:25]
is it going to be next week and so the

[01:08:23 - 01:08:28]
idea is that you're going to plot your

[01:08:25 - 01:08:31]
data onto a graph or vector space our

[01:08:28 - 01:08:33]
dots are represented as vectors um and

[01:08:31 - 01:08:34]
we're going to draw a line through it

[01:08:33 - 01:08:37]
which we call a regression line and the

[01:08:34 - 01:08:40]
point of the regression line is that is

[01:08:37 - 01:08:42]
our prediction so if this is going over

[01:08:40 - 01:08:45]
time based on the temperature um you

[01:08:42 - 01:08:47]
know uh that is how we are figuring out

[01:08:45 - 01:08:50]
in the future what things are going to

[01:08:47 - 01:08:52]
be so the distance of a vector from the

[01:08:50 - 01:08:54]
regression line going to just get out a

[01:08:52 - 01:08:57]
different colored pen tool other than

[01:08:54 - 01:08:59]
red so maybe s and so imagine this dot

[01:08:57 - 01:09:01]
here to the line that's what we're going

[01:08:59 - 01:09:03]
to call an error because the idea is

[01:09:01 - 01:09:05]
that um things that are closer to the

[01:09:03 - 01:09:07]
line is the prediction and things that

[01:09:05 - 01:09:09]
are farther away from the line are an

[01:09:07 - 01:09:11]
error from the line so hopefully that

[01:09:09 - 01:09:13]
makes sense there are different

[01:09:11 - 01:09:15]
regression algorithms used uh uh that

[01:09:13 - 01:09:19]
can uh that we use to predict future

[01:09:15 - 01:09:22]
variables so we have mean squared error

[01:09:19 - 01:09:25]
uh root mean squ error mean absolute

[01:09:22 - 01:09:27]
error and So based on the algorithm that

[01:09:25 - 01:09:31]
you use to draw your line that's going

[01:09:27 - 01:09:34]
to change um the prediction

[01:09:31 - 01:09:37]
[Music]

[01:09:34 - 01:09:39]
okay let's take a look at classification

[01:09:37 - 01:09:41]
this is the process of finding a

[01:09:39 - 01:09:45]
function to divide a label data set into

[01:09:41 - 01:09:47]
classes or categories so the idea here

[01:09:45 - 01:09:50]
is we're going to predict a category to

[01:09:47 - 01:09:52]
apply to the inputed data so will it

[01:09:50 - 01:09:54]
rain next Saturday is it going to be

[01:09:52 - 01:09:56]
sunny or is it going to be raining so

[01:09:54 - 01:09:58]
the idea is we have our data we're

[01:09:56 - 01:10:01]
plotting it on a graph but we're drawing

[01:09:58 - 01:10:04]
a classification line that divides the

[01:10:01 - 01:10:07]
data set okay and the idea is that if it

[01:10:04 - 01:10:09]
falls on one side then it's sunny it

[01:10:07 - 01:10:11]
falls on the other side then it's rainy

[01:10:09 - 01:10:12]
and so again if you have a different

[01:10:11 - 01:10:15]
type of algorithm that's the thing

[01:10:12 - 01:10:17]
that's doing the division um it's going

[01:10:15 - 01:10:20]
to have different results you have a a

[01:10:17 - 01:10:22]
logistic regression a decision tree

[01:10:20 - 01:10:27]
random Forest you can use a neural

[01:10:22 - 01:10:29]
network you can use a a a name AV v b I

[01:10:27 - 01:10:32]
always say that wrong so I do apologize

[01:10:29 - 01:10:37]
or you can use KNN or you can use a

[01:10:32 - 01:10:38]
support Vector machine at or svm so just

[01:10:37 - 01:10:40]
understand that there could be more

[01:10:38 - 01:10:41]
algorithms of this but these are the

[01:10:40 - 01:10:43]
common ones and you know if you want to

[01:10:41 - 01:10:45]
learn more about how these different

[01:10:43 - 01:10:47]
algorithms will change just look up on

[01:10:45 - 01:10:48]
the Internet uh what that would look

[01:10:47 - 01:10:51]
like and there's definitely

[01:10:48 - 01:10:54]
visualizations out there

[01:10:51 - 01:10:56]
[Music]

[01:10:54 - 01:10:58]
okay let's talk about clustering this is

[01:10:56 - 01:11:00]
the process of grouping unlabeled data

[01:10:58 - 01:11:03]
based on similarities and differences

[01:11:00 - 01:11:06]
the key word here is unlabeled when we

[01:11:03 - 01:11:10]
looked at uh um classification that was

[01:11:06 - 01:11:11]
labeled data so the idea here is that

[01:11:10 - 01:11:14]
we're grouping based on similar user

[01:11:11 - 01:11:16]
differences so imagine that this

[01:11:14 - 01:11:18]
grouping of dots that are close together

[01:11:16 - 01:11:22]
we determined that that is Windows and

[01:11:18 - 01:11:24]
this uh group of dots are Mac computers

[01:11:22 - 01:11:25]
and just like classification progression

[01:11:24 - 01:11:27]
you have different algorithms are going

[01:11:25 - 01:11:29]
to give you different results and the

[01:11:27 - 01:11:32]
reason why I show you these algorithm

[01:11:29 - 01:11:34]
names is because when you have to do

[01:11:32 - 01:11:36]
classification regression or uh

[01:11:34 - 01:11:38]
clustering uh you're going to see these

[01:11:36 - 01:11:40]
names because you're have to choose what

[01:11:38 - 01:11:42]
algorithm you want to utilize right now

[01:11:40 - 01:11:44]
it's not so important to uh know them

[01:11:42 - 01:11:47]
but when they are important we will look

[01:11:44 - 01:11:50]
at them uh in more detail

[01:11:47 - 01:11:53]
[Music]

[01:11:50 - 01:11:54]
okay so we are going to dive into the

[01:11:53 - 01:11:56]
types of machine learning in other

[01:11:54 - 01:11:58]
slides in more detail but this is just

[01:11:56 - 01:12:00]
kind of an overview so that you can kind

[01:11:58 - 01:12:02]
of see these terms up front um so we'll

[01:12:00 - 01:12:04]
just quickly go through this here and

[01:12:02 - 01:12:05]
we're going to group them um based on

[01:12:04 - 01:12:07]
what they're trying to do so the first

[01:12:05 - 01:12:09]
is learning problems we have supervised

[01:12:07 - 01:12:11]
unsupervised reinforcement these are

[01:12:09 - 01:12:13]
three terms you're going to hear quite a

[01:12:11 - 01:12:15]
bit with machine learning uh the key

[01:12:13 - 01:12:17]
thing here is that supervised is where

[01:12:15 - 01:12:19]
you have labeled data and unsupervised

[01:12:17 - 01:12:20]
is where you're working with unlabel

[01:12:19 - 01:12:23]
data for

[01:12:20 - 01:12:25]
reinforcement this is an agent an agent

[01:12:23 - 01:12:27]
that operates in an environment and must

[01:12:25 - 01:12:29]
learn to operate using feedback and this

[01:12:27 - 01:12:31]
kind of sounds like agentic workflows or

[01:12:29 - 01:12:33]
agentic coding we're talking about gen

[01:12:31 - 01:12:35]
which we'll learn about later but the

[01:12:33 - 01:12:37]
idea is like imagine you wanted to make

[01:12:35 - 01:12:41]
a uh a machine learning model that

[01:12:37 - 01:12:43]
played the the Mario or or the Sonic

[01:12:41 - 01:12:45]
video game that'd be using reinforcement

[01:12:43 - 01:12:46]
learning okay then we have hybrid

[01:12:45 - 01:12:49]
learning problems so we have

[01:12:46 - 01:12:52]
semisupervised self-supervised multi-

[01:12:49 - 01:12:56]
instance so semi-supervised is where you

[01:12:52 - 01:12:57]
have a mix of labeled unlabeled data you

[01:12:56 - 01:13:00]
have a lot of unlabeled data and a

[01:12:57 - 01:13:02]
little bit of labeled data and so um

[01:13:00 - 01:13:03]
that's kind of a a mix between

[01:13:02 - 01:13:06]
supervised and unsupervised you have

[01:13:03 - 01:13:09]
self supervised um and I believe that

[01:13:06 - 01:13:11]
this is where um the idea is that it can

[01:13:09 - 01:13:13]
label its own data I think but we'll

[01:13:11 - 01:13:16]
find out later on in future slides we

[01:13:13 - 01:13:18]
have multi- instance where we have um

[01:13:16 - 01:13:21]
examples of unlabeled data and so then

[01:13:18 - 01:13:23]
we just kind of bag them together um

[01:13:21 - 01:13:24]
again we'll cover that later on we have

[01:13:23 - 01:13:27]
statistical inference so here we have

[01:13:24 - 01:13:29]
inductive deductive and and transductive

[01:13:27 - 01:13:31]
so using evidence to determine the

[01:13:29 - 01:13:33]
outcome or then we have deductive using

[01:13:31 - 01:13:35]
general rules to determine the specific

[01:13:33 - 01:13:38]
outcomes and then we have transductive

[01:13:35 - 01:13:41]
used uh to predict specific examples

[01:13:38 - 01:13:44]
given specific uh specific things from a

[01:13:41 - 01:13:47]
specific domain okay then for learning

[01:13:44 - 01:13:50]
techniques we have multitask active

[01:13:47 - 01:13:53]
online transfer and Ensemble so

[01:13:50 - 01:13:56]
multitask is fitting a model on one data

[01:13:53 - 01:13:58]
set that addresses multiple Rel problems

[01:13:56 - 01:14:00]
active is the model is able to query a

[01:13:58 - 01:14:02]
human operator during the learning

[01:14:00 - 01:14:04]
process um online is using available

[01:14:02 - 01:14:06]
data and updating the model before

[01:14:04 - 01:14:09]
prediction is made kind of sounds like

[01:14:06 - 01:14:10]
rag when we're talking about gen um but

[01:14:09 - 01:14:12]
again this is just general machine

[01:14:10 - 01:14:14]
learning right so we have transfer and

[01:14:12 - 01:14:16]
model is first trained on one task and

[01:14:14 - 01:14:18]
then some are all the models used as a

[01:14:16 - 01:14:21]
starting point for uh for related task

[01:14:18 - 01:14:23]
and then we have uh Ensemble where uh

[01:14:21 - 01:14:25]
two or more models are fit on the same

[01:14:23 - 01:14:28]
data and the predictions from each model

[01:14:25 - 01:14:29]
are combined so yeah we're going to see

[01:14:28 - 01:14:32]
these terms again but just trying to get

[01:14:29 - 01:14:35]
it uh up front here for you

[01:14:32 - 01:14:38]
[Music]

[01:14:35 - 01:14:39]
okay let's take a look at the divisions

[01:14:38 - 01:14:42]
of machine learning this is just another

[01:14:39 - 01:14:43]
way to break up machine learning um and

[01:14:42 - 01:14:45]
these terms you're going to see uh more

[01:14:43 - 01:14:47]
in how we're going to structure our

[01:14:45 - 01:14:49]
upcoming slides here so I just want to

[01:14:47 - 01:14:51]
give you a quick overview here so we

[01:14:49 - 01:14:52]
have classical machine learning and the

[01:14:51 - 01:14:53]
advantage of classical machine learning

[01:14:52 - 01:14:56]
is the data is simple you have clear

[01:14:53 - 01:14:59]
features um um and generally classic

[01:14:56 - 01:15:01]
machine learning is extremely uh cost

[01:14:59 - 01:15:03]
efficient compared to other types of

[01:15:01 - 01:15:06]
machine learning but this is where you

[01:15:03 - 01:15:07]
have supervised unsupervised uh kind of

[01:15:06 - 01:15:09]
uh stuff so you know when you think of

[01:15:07 - 01:15:10]
classical machine learning think of

[01:15:09 - 01:15:13]
those two things supervised and

[01:15:10 - 01:15:15]
unsupervised um uh learning then you

[01:15:13 - 01:15:17]
have reinforcement learning this is uh

[01:15:15 - 01:15:20]
when there is no data and the idea is

[01:15:17 - 01:15:23]
that the model is going to through trial

[01:15:20 - 01:15:25]
and error figure out what is the right

[01:15:23 - 01:15:28]
thing to do this is where we have

[01:15:25 - 01:15:31]
real-time decision- making game AI so we

[01:15:28 - 01:15:34]
talked about Mario or sonic uh uh like

[01:15:31 - 01:15:36]
the the ml model playing those games and

[01:15:34 - 01:15:39]
failing again and again and again until

[01:15:36 - 01:15:42]
it can pass the game a learning task or

[01:15:39 - 01:15:43]
robot navigation so think of automous uh

[01:15:42 - 01:15:45]
driving vehicles that would be a good

[01:15:43 - 01:15:48]
case for reinforcement learning we have

[01:15:45 - 01:15:50]
Ensemble methods when uh quality of data

[01:15:48 - 01:15:52]
is a problem so then you are going to

[01:15:50 - 01:15:54]
have different strategies to work with

[01:15:52 - 01:15:56]
multiple models or algorithms to have a

[01:15:54 - 01:15:59]
better outcome and here we have things

[01:15:56 - 01:16:01]
like bagging boosting stacking okay and

[01:15:59 - 01:16:02]
so you know you'll see those terms like

[01:16:01 - 01:16:05]
boosting you'll definitely see the word

[01:16:02 - 01:16:06]
boost more uh when we get to that then

[01:16:05 - 01:16:07]
we have neural networks and deep

[01:16:06 - 01:16:09]
learning you should just really think of

[01:16:07 - 01:16:11]
deep learning as neural networks this is

[01:16:09 - 01:16:14]
when the data is complicated and or the

[01:16:11 - 01:16:15]
features are unclear this is where you'd

[01:16:14 - 01:16:18]
use uh neural networks like a

[01:16:15 - 01:16:22]
convolutional neural network a recurrent

[01:16:18 - 01:16:23]
neural network uh a gan so generative

[01:16:22 - 01:16:25]
adversarial

[01:16:23 - 01:16:29]
[Music]

[01:16:25 - 01:16:33]
adversarial Network sorry U multi-layer

[01:16:29 - 01:16:35]
percepton uh or perceptrons sorry MLP

[01:16:33 - 01:16:36]
Auto encoders and I just have a really

[01:16:35 - 01:16:37]
hard time pronouncing these things but

[01:16:36 - 01:16:39]
yeah you're going to see these terms

[01:16:37 - 01:16:40]
again so again don't worry about it

[01:16:39 - 01:16:43]
right

[01:16:40 - 01:16:46]
[Music]

[01:16:43 - 01:16:48]
now let's take a look here at classical

[01:16:46 - 01:16:50]
machine learning and so when we say

[01:16:48 - 01:16:52]
classical we're talking about algorithms

[01:16:50 - 01:16:55]
that have existed for quite a while may

[01:16:52 - 01:16:57]
maybe as early as the 1950s because we

[01:16:55 - 01:16:58]
had these mathematicians and they

[01:16:57 - 01:17:01]
figured these out and a lot of these

[01:16:58 - 01:17:03]
things actually relate to um statistics

[01:17:01 - 01:17:07]
right so we're taking statistics um and

[01:17:03 - 01:17:09]
utilizing them uh in these algorithms in

[01:17:07 - 01:17:11]
our Computing spaces so hopefully that

[01:17:09 - 01:17:13]
makes sense but yeah it's they're called

[01:17:11 - 01:17:15]
classical ml because we are dealing with

[01:17:13 - 01:17:16]
algorithms and one example would be

[01:17:15 - 01:17:17]
nearest neighbor algorithm which was

[01:17:16 - 01:17:20]
invented in

[01:17:17 - 01:17:22]
1967 and lots of companies today

[01:17:20 - 01:17:24]
definitely could utilize classical

[01:17:22 - 01:17:25]
machine learning uh to solve business

[01:17:24 - 01:17:27]
problems just because they're old does

[01:17:25 - 01:17:29]
not mean that they're not good it's just

[01:17:27 - 01:17:32]
a matter of organizations knowing how to

[01:17:29 - 01:17:34]
adopt uh classical machine learning so

[01:17:32 - 01:17:36]
let's talk about first supervised

[01:17:34 - 01:17:38]
learning so this is where we have data

[01:17:36 - 01:17:40]
that has been labeled into categories

[01:17:38 - 01:17:41]
and this is great when we are doing

[01:17:40 - 01:17:43]
something that is Task driven we're

[01:17:41 - 01:17:45]
trying to make a prediction because the

[01:17:43 - 01:17:48]
idea is we have this labeled data and so

[01:17:45 - 01:17:51]
then we can bring unlabeled data and

[01:17:48 - 01:17:54]
tell the machine to label it right so

[01:17:51 - 01:17:55]
here we have classification so imagine

[01:17:54 - 01:17:57]
we want an outcome this would be to

[01:17:55 - 01:17:59]
predict the C what category something

[01:17:57 - 01:18:01]
belongs to a use case here would be

[01:17:59 - 01:18:03]
identity fraud detection we have

[01:18:01 - 01:18:06]
regression this is where maybe we want

[01:18:03 - 01:18:08]
to predict a variable in the future so

[01:18:06 - 01:18:11]
we're we're trying to figure out a

[01:18:08 - 01:18:13]
market forecast um and we cover you know

[01:18:11 - 01:18:15]
classical regression so you should know

[01:18:13 - 01:18:16]
what these are um if not you will know

[01:18:15 - 01:18:19]
about what they are soon enough because

[01:18:16 - 01:18:21]
we'll cover them more than once um then

[01:18:19 - 01:18:24]
for unsupervised learning we have data

[01:18:21 - 01:18:27]
that has been not been labeled okay this

[01:18:24 - 01:18:29]
is where things are data driven so we

[01:18:27 - 01:18:33]
recognize a structure or a pattern we're

[01:18:29 - 01:18:35]
not making a very specific prediction um

[01:18:33 - 01:18:36]
here we have clustering so the outcome

[01:18:35 - 01:18:39]
of something so you group data based on

[01:18:36 - 01:18:41]
similarities or differences example here

[01:18:39 - 01:18:43]
would be targeted marketing Association

[01:18:41 - 01:18:46]
so find a relationship between variables

[01:18:43 - 01:18:47]
through Association the use case here

[01:18:46 - 01:18:49]
would be a custo a customer

[01:18:47 - 01:18:52]
recommendation we have dimens

[01:18:49 - 01:18:53]
dimensionality reduction so here help

[01:18:52 - 01:18:55]
reduce the amount of data or

[01:18:53 - 01:18:58]
pre-processing this is a problem you

[01:18:55 - 01:18:59]
have a lot of data um and this a use

[01:18:58 - 01:19:03]
case here would be big data

[01:18:59 - 01:19:07]
visualization so um yeah there you

[01:19:03 - 01:19:09]
[Music]

[01:19:07 - 01:19:11]
go all right let's compare supervised

[01:19:09 - 01:19:13]
versus unsupervised learning and I know

[01:19:11 - 01:19:15]
we've already talked about it like twice

[01:19:13 - 01:19:16]
before but we're going to talk about it

[01:19:15 - 01:19:18]
again and then again because I'm just

[01:19:16 - 01:19:21]
trying to give it to you in different

[01:19:18 - 01:19:22]
perspectives so that you really know the

[01:19:21 - 01:19:24]
difference between these so let's talk

[01:19:22 - 01:19:25]
about what is supervised learning so

[01:19:24 - 01:19:27]
this is a machine learning task or

[01:19:25 - 01:19:29]
function that needs to be provided

[01:19:27 - 01:19:31]
training data and the training data is

[01:19:29 - 01:19:33]
when you provide labeled data the

[01:19:31 - 01:19:36]
correct answers and the Machine can

[01:19:33 - 01:19:38]
learn from those results so show me how

[01:19:36 - 01:19:40]
to do it and then I can do it on my own

[01:19:38 - 01:19:42]
that's what's happening here and so for

[01:19:40 - 01:19:43]
supervised learning models we have

[01:19:42 - 01:19:46]
classification

[01:19:43 - 01:19:48]
regression what about unsupervised

[01:19:46 - 01:19:49]
learning this is a machine learning Tas

[01:19:48 - 01:19:52]
or function that needs no existing

[01:19:49 - 01:19:54]
training data uh for this it will take

[01:19:52 - 01:19:56]
the unlabeled data and discover its

[01:19:54 - 01:19:58]
patterns applying its own labels so I am

[01:19:56 - 01:20:01]
an independent worker I can figure this

[01:19:58 - 01:20:03]
out on my own right uh and for this

[01:20:01 - 01:20:05]
these unsupervised learning models we

[01:20:03 - 01:20:09]
really should have put the unon that

[01:20:05 - 01:20:11]
there let me just fix that there

[01:20:09 - 01:20:13]
unsupervised we have clustering

[01:20:11 - 01:20:15]
Association Dimension dimensionality

[01:20:13 - 01:20:17]
reduction and so supervised learning

[01:20:15 - 01:20:19]
tends to be more accurate than

[01:20:17 - 01:20:21]
unsupervised learning but requires more

[01:20:19 - 01:20:23]
upfront work whereas unsupervised

[01:20:21 - 01:20:25]
learning still requires human

[01:20:23 - 01:20:26]
intervention to validate the results so

[01:20:25 - 01:20:30]
hopefully that is clear

[01:20:26 - 01:20:33]
[Music]

[01:20:30 - 01:20:35]
okay okay let's review it one more time

[01:20:33 - 01:20:36]
I know it's getting tiresome but it's

[01:20:35 - 01:20:38]
very important that you remember the

[01:20:36 - 01:20:39]
difference between supervis unsupervised

[01:20:38 - 01:20:41]
and reinforcement so supervised learning

[01:20:39 - 01:20:43]
is where the data has been labeled for

[01:20:41 - 01:20:45]
training it's Tas driven and you're

[01:20:43 - 01:20:48]
making a prediction this is when the

[01:20:45 - 01:20:50]
labels are known and you want a precise

[01:20:48 - 01:20:53]
outcome when you need a specific value

[01:20:50 - 01:20:55]
return and so here we use classification

[01:20:53 - 01:20:57]
regression as example examples of

[01:20:55 - 01:20:59]
supervised learning there's more than

[01:20:57 - 01:21:01]
just those two but that's what I want

[01:20:59 - 01:21:03]
you to know for now we have unsupervised

[01:21:01 - 01:21:05]
learning data that has not been labeled

[01:21:03 - 01:21:06]
the ml model needs to do its own

[01:21:05 - 01:21:08]
labeling it is Data driven you're

[01:21:06 - 01:21:10]
recognizing a structure or a pattern

[01:21:08 - 01:21:12]
when the labels are not known and the

[01:21:10 - 01:21:14]
outcome does not need to be precise when

[01:21:12 - 01:21:16]
you're trying to make sense of data here

[01:21:14 - 01:21:18]
we have clustering dimensionality

[01:21:16 - 01:21:21]
reduction Association then you have

[01:21:18 - 01:21:23]
reinforcement learning so there's no

[01:21:21 - 01:21:25]
data and there's an environment and an

[01:21:23 - 01:21:28]
ml model generates data and many

[01:21:25 - 01:21:31]
attempts to reach the goal this is

[01:21:28 - 01:21:33]
decision driven you have game AI

[01:21:31 - 01:21:36]
learning task robot navigation so

[01:21:33 - 01:21:39]
hopefully that is clear and it's in your

[01:21:36 - 01:21:42]
head um we're going to repeat these

[01:21:39 - 01:21:44]
again but it's going to be less of this

[01:21:42 - 01:21:48]
um and more detail

[01:21:44 - 01:21:50]
[Music]

[01:21:48 - 01:21:52]
okay let's talk about supervised

[01:21:50 - 01:21:55]
learning models and we're going to cover

[01:21:52 - 01:21:57]
classification and regression again

[01:21:55 - 01:21:59]
um just so that we really know that we

[01:21:57 - 01:22:01]
know what these things are so

[01:21:59 - 01:22:03]
classification is a process of finding a

[01:22:01 - 01:22:06]
function to divide a data set into

[01:22:03 - 01:22:09]
classes or categories so imagine will it

[01:22:06 - 01:22:12]
be cold or will it be hot tomorrow right

[01:22:09 - 01:22:13]
so very clear it's either one or the

[01:22:12 - 01:22:15]
other it's going to fall on one side of

[01:22:13 - 01:22:17]
the line or the other one we have

[01:22:15 - 01:22:21]
different algorithms we can use like log

[01:22:17 - 01:22:25]
Logistics regression K nearest neighbor

[01:22:21 - 01:22:28]
support Vector machines kernel spms

[01:22:25 - 01:22:30]
uh Navy's uh bay decision stre

[01:22:28 - 01:22:31]
classification random Force

[01:22:30 - 01:22:33]
classification so we're listing a lot

[01:22:31 - 01:22:35]
more here we have what is regression

[01:22:33 - 01:22:37]
regression is a process of finding a

[01:22:35 - 01:22:40]
function to correlate a data set into a

[01:22:37 - 01:22:42]
continuous variable number so what is

[01:22:40 - 01:22:45]
the temperature going to be tomorrow and

[01:22:42 - 01:22:47]
here we have uh things like s uh simple

[01:22:45 - 01:22:51]
linear regression multiple linear

[01:22:47 - 01:22:53]
regression polom regression support

[01:22:51 - 01:22:55]
Vector regression decision tree

[01:22:53 - 01:22:57]
regressions random for

[01:22:55 - 01:22:59]
regression just again want to

[01:22:57 - 01:23:02]
continuously repeat that so you know

[01:22:59 - 01:23:06]
what these things are

[01:23:02 - 01:23:09]
[Music]

[01:23:06 - 01:23:11]
okay let's take a look at unsupervised

[01:23:09 - 01:23:14]
learning uh so what can we do here we

[01:23:11 - 01:23:15]
have clustering and again we've covered

[01:23:14 - 01:23:17]
these prior but I just really want to

[01:23:15 - 01:23:18]
make sure that you know what they are so

[01:23:17 - 01:23:21]
clustering is a process of grouping

[01:23:18 - 01:23:22]
unlabeled data based on S similarities

[01:23:21 - 01:23:24]
and

[01:23:22 - 01:23:27]
differences right so we Ed an example

[01:23:24 - 01:23:29]
previous viously um you know is this a

[01:23:27 - 01:23:31]
Mac or is it a Windows here it's about

[01:23:29 - 01:23:32]
age and something else and so it's

[01:23:31 - 01:23:34]
saying you know is are these people do

[01:23:32 - 01:23:37]
these people have cholesterol are they

[01:23:34 - 01:23:40]
highrisk or lowrisk um for chering

[01:23:37 - 01:23:42]
algorithms we have K means uh DB scan K

[01:23:40 - 01:23:44]
modes then we have Association so

[01:23:42 - 01:23:46]
Association is the process of finding

[01:23:44 - 01:23:48]
relationship between variables through

[01:23:46 - 01:23:52]
Association um so the idea is that if

[01:23:48 - 01:23:54]
somebody buys breads then suggest butter

[01:23:52 - 01:23:56]
because based on previous combinations

[01:23:54 - 01:23:59]
we know what people want um so there are

[01:23:56 - 01:24:01]
different algorithms for that I cannot

[01:23:59 - 01:24:02]
say those words so I'm not going to

[01:24:01 - 01:24:04]
attempt it but you can see them here on

[01:24:02 - 01:24:06]
the right hand side we have

[01:24:04 - 01:24:08]
dimensionality reduction this is where

[01:24:06 - 01:24:10]
we're reducing the amount of data we

[01:24:08 - 01:24:13]
retaining the data Integrity often used

[01:24:10 - 01:24:15]
as a pre-processing stage and we have

[01:24:13 - 01:24:17]
lots of algorithms for this principal

[01:24:15 - 01:24:18]
component analysis linear discriminant

[01:24:17 - 01:24:20]
analysis generalized discriminate

[01:24:18 - 01:24:24]
analysis singular value

[01:24:20 - 01:24:25]
decomposition uh Laden uh dial I can't

[01:24:24 - 01:24:27]
can't say that word there's just too

[01:24:25 - 01:24:29]
many words that are too hard to say but

[01:24:27 - 01:24:32]
there's a lot there's a lot for dimens

[01:24:29 - 01:24:34]
dimensionality reduction um yeah and so

[01:24:32 - 01:24:36]
hopefully you can remember those things

[01:24:34 - 01:24:39]
classification regression clustering

[01:24:36 - 01:24:40]
Association Dimension dimensionality

[01:24:39 - 01:24:44]
reduction

[01:24:40 - 01:24:46]
[Music]

[01:24:44 - 01:24:47]
okay let's take a look here at neural

[01:24:46 - 01:24:50]
networks and deep learning first

[01:24:47 - 01:24:51]
defining what are neural networks so

[01:24:50 - 01:24:54]
these are often described as mimicking

[01:24:51 - 01:24:56]
the brain you have a neuron or node that

[01:24:54 - 01:24:58]
represents an algorithm the data is

[01:24:56 - 01:25:00]
inputed into the neuron and based on the

[01:24:58 - 01:25:02]
output the data will be passed to one of

[01:25:00 - 01:25:04]
the many connected neurals the

[01:25:02 - 01:25:06]
connections between neurons is weighted

[01:25:04 - 01:25:08]
the network is organized into layers

[01:25:06 - 01:25:09]
there will be an input layer multiple

[01:25:08 - 01:25:11]
hidden layers and an output layer you

[01:25:09 - 01:25:13]
could technically have one hidden layer

[01:25:11 - 01:25:16]
but often you have multiple layers if

[01:25:13 - 01:25:17]
you have three or more now we're talking

[01:25:16 - 01:25:20]
about deep learning if you have less

[01:25:17 - 01:25:22]
than three that's just a neural network

[01:25:20 - 01:25:24]
um and just look at the visual for here

[01:25:22 - 01:25:28]
for a moment because each node or uh

[01:25:24 - 01:25:30]
neural remember that it has its own um

[01:25:28 - 01:25:33]
its own algorithm like how it's going to

[01:25:30 - 01:25:36]
process that data and I'm pretty certain

[01:25:33 - 01:25:37]
that most neural networks the the

[01:25:36 - 01:25:39]
algorithm is going to be same for all

[01:25:37 - 01:25:42]
the nodes but we'll talk about that as

[01:25:39 - 01:25:44]
we dig deeper into the neurons

[01:25:42 - 01:25:46]
themselves um but then there's the

[01:25:44 - 01:25:48]
concept of a feed forward neural network

[01:25:46 - 01:25:51]
which is initializes fnn I don't know

[01:25:48 - 01:25:53]
why it's not ffnn but whatever so these

[01:25:51 - 01:25:55]
are neural networks where connections

[01:25:53 - 01:25:58]
between nodes do not form a cycle that

[01:25:55 - 01:26:01]
means that they always move forward so

[01:25:58 - 01:26:03]
data moves forward okay we don't have

[01:26:01 - 01:26:06]
neural Network's going back and this way

[01:26:03 - 01:26:09]
and that way they're just going One

[01:26:06 - 01:26:13]
Direction which is forward then you have

[01:26:09 - 01:26:15]
back propagation this is where after um

[01:26:13 - 01:26:18]
things ran into like everything's ran

[01:26:15 - 01:26:21]
through it's going to move backwards

[01:26:18 - 01:26:22]
through the neural network and adjust

[01:26:21 - 01:26:24]
the

[01:26:22 - 01:26:26]
weights okay to improve

[01:26:24 - 01:26:27]
the outcome on the next iteration so

[01:26:26 - 01:26:30]
after it's ran it actually just to

[01:26:27 - 01:26:33]
update all the weights and that is back

[01:26:30 - 01:26:35]
propagation this is how a neural network

[01:26:33 - 01:26:38]
learns it has to do back

[01:26:35 - 01:26:40]
propagation okay then we have a loss

[01:26:38 - 01:26:42]
function so it's a function that

[01:26:40 - 01:26:44]
compares the ground truth to the

[01:26:42 - 01:26:47]
prediction to determine the error rate

[01:26:44 - 01:26:52]
so how bad the network performed ground

[01:26:47 - 01:26:55]
truth right is data that is labeled that

[01:26:52 - 01:26:58]
you know to be correct okay okay now

[01:26:55 - 01:27:01]
we're talking about how these neurons

[01:26:58 - 01:27:03]
are going to have their own algorithm

[01:27:01 - 01:27:05]
right because up here we say that uh it

[01:27:03 - 01:27:08]
represents an algorithm so this is where

[01:27:05 - 01:27:10]
we have these um algorithms which we

[01:27:08 - 01:27:12]
call activation functions so an

[01:27:10 - 01:27:15]
activation function is an algorithm

[01:27:12 - 01:27:16]
applied to a hidden layer node it's one

[01:27:15 - 01:27:19]
of these things right here let me just

[01:27:16 - 01:27:22]
get my pen out again one of these that

[01:27:19 - 01:27:25]
affects the connected output and so an

[01:27:22 - 01:27:27]
example of that would be ru or reu I

[01:27:25 - 01:27:29]
don't know how to pronounce it properly

[01:27:27 - 01:27:31]
but I recognize it uh but we will be

[01:27:29 - 01:27:36]
looking at activation functions when we

[01:27:31 - 01:27:38]
look at Neons a bit uh a bit soon here

[01:27:36 - 01:27:40]
um there's the concept of DSE so when

[01:27:38 - 01:27:43]
the network layer increases the amount

[01:27:40 - 01:27:46]
of nodes we call it more dense uh and

[01:27:43 - 01:27:48]
when the layers decrease the the amount

[01:27:46 - 01:27:51]
of nodes we call it sparse okay so when

[01:27:48 - 01:27:54]
we see an increase it's dense if it's

[01:27:51 - 01:27:56]
decreasing it's spse um and for deep

[01:27:54 - 01:27:57]
learning algorithms we have supervised

[01:27:56 - 01:28:01]
and unsupervised just like with

[01:27:57 - 01:28:02]
classical machine learning um and so on

[01:28:01 - 01:28:07]
the supervised side we're going to see

[01:28:02 - 01:28:10]
things like uh fnn RNN CNN so you are

[01:28:07 - 01:28:13]
passing in labeled data for this to work

[01:28:10 - 01:28:17]
for unsupervised learning we we have uh

[01:28:13 - 01:28:18]
dbn's SES RBM S's and not important to

[01:28:17 - 01:28:20]
really remember this but I just wanted

[01:28:18 - 01:28:23]
you to know that they have supervised

[01:28:20 - 01:28:25]
and unsupervised learning um uh for for

[01:28:23 - 01:28:29]
de keep learning

[01:28:25 - 01:28:32]
[Music]

[01:28:29 - 01:28:34]
okay hey this is angre brown and we are

[01:28:32 - 01:28:36]
taking a look at Bert so Bert stands for

[01:28:34 - 01:28:38]
bidirectional encoder representations

[01:28:36 - 01:28:41]
from Transformers and this was a model

[01:28:38 - 01:28:43]
that was released in 2018 by Google

[01:28:41 - 01:28:46]
researchers um and you can find uh the

[01:28:43 - 01:28:49]
models on hugging face for the account

[01:28:46 - 01:28:51]
organization Google BT but the easy way

[01:28:49 - 01:28:53]
to think of uh Bert or this is the

[01:28:51 - 01:28:55]
easiest way that I like to understand it

[01:28:53 - 01:28:57]
is that there's that Transformer

[01:28:55 - 01:28:59]
architecture that we saw from all

[01:28:57 - 01:29:01]
attention is all you need if you were to

[01:28:59 - 01:29:03]
just take the encoder and then feed it

[01:29:01 - 01:29:05]
into itself multiple times you would get

[01:29:03 - 01:29:08]
Bert and at least that's how I

[01:29:05 - 01:29:10]
understand it to be um and so Bert is

[01:29:08 - 01:29:12]
bir directional meaning that it can R

[01:29:10 - 01:29:15]
text both left to right and right to

[01:29:12 - 01:29:17]
left to understand the context of text

[01:29:15 - 01:29:19]
so it really does understand um the

[01:29:17 - 01:29:22]
context of of of words and where they

[01:29:19 - 01:29:24]
are in sentences um Bert is pre-trained

[01:29:22 - 01:29:27]
on the following task so it uses Mass

[01:29:24 - 01:29:30]
language model um and so that kind of

[01:29:27 - 01:29:32]
task is where you provide uh let's say a

[01:29:30 - 01:29:35]
sentence and then you have like fill in

[01:29:32 - 01:29:37]
the blanks so they say that they Mass

[01:29:35 - 01:29:39]
tokens for uh sentence input but I would

[01:29:37 - 01:29:41]
describe it as uh it's filling in the

[01:29:39 - 01:29:44]
blanks for sentences the other part of

[01:29:41 - 01:29:45]
it is it does next sentence prediction

[01:29:44 - 01:29:48]
so this is provided this is where you

[01:29:45 - 01:29:50]
provide two sentences um A and B and so

[01:29:48 - 01:29:53]
the idea is that Bert will predict if B

[01:29:50 - 01:29:54]
would follow a so by being trained on

[01:29:53 - 01:29:57]
these two things

[01:29:54 - 01:30:01]
um it provides it the ability to uh be

[01:29:57 - 01:30:02]
aware contextually aware of sentences

[01:30:01 - 01:30:05]
and be very good at natural language

[01:30:02 - 01:30:07]
processing now the model itself in this

[01:30:05 - 01:30:09]
state you're not going to do anything

[01:30:07 - 01:30:12]
with it you need to then train it

[01:30:09 - 01:30:14]
further for a specific task and so this

[01:30:12 - 01:30:16]
could be for name entity Rec uh

[01:30:14 - 01:30:18]
recognition questioning answering

[01:30:16 - 01:30:21]
sentence perir task summarization

[01:30:18 - 01:30:22]
feature extraction beddings and more

[01:30:21 - 01:30:25]
there's absolutely more things you can

[01:30:22 - 01:30:26]
do here and Bert comes in many many

[01:30:25 - 01:30:29]
different sizes so you have the base

[01:30:26 - 01:30:32]
which is 100 million parameters you have

[01:30:29 - 01:30:34]
large which is 240 parameters you have

[01:30:32 - 01:30:36]
uh tiny which is 4 million parameters

[01:30:34 - 01:30:38]
and there's like 24 or so other

[01:30:36 - 01:30:40]
additional models um if you go to the

[01:30:38 - 01:30:42]
Wikipedia it tells you how much data it

[01:30:40 - 01:30:45]
was trained on it was something like 800

[01:30:42 - 01:30:46]
million something somethings uh and it

[01:30:45 - 01:30:48]
was like the the Corpus text was from

[01:30:46 - 01:30:50]
the Toronto library in the Wikipedia

[01:30:48 - 01:30:53]
English so this is primarily trained on

[01:30:50 - 01:30:56]
English I'm sure there are multilingual

[01:30:53 - 01:30:59]
variants uh if we were to go over um to

[01:30:56 - 01:31:01]
hugging face and uh there are many Bert

[01:30:59 - 01:31:04]
variants that try to be better or solve

[01:31:01 - 01:31:07]
other things uh with Bert um which is

[01:31:04 - 01:31:10]
fine and while Bert is an Al model it is

[01:31:07 - 01:31:12]
still used and it's ubiquit Baseline in

[01:31:10 - 01:31:14]
natural language processing so when I

[01:31:12 - 01:31:17]
say that I mean like they use it as a

[01:31:14 - 01:31:21]
baseline or or uh against other other

[01:31:17 - 01:31:22]
things because it's just uh so good um

[01:31:21 - 01:31:24]
that it's not going away anytime soon

[01:31:22 - 01:31:26]
here's an example of using us Bert so

[01:31:24 - 01:31:28]
let just get my pen tool out here so we

[01:31:26 - 01:31:30]
can get a little bit closer here but the

[01:31:28 - 01:31:32]
idea here is that here we're using um

[01:31:30 - 01:31:33]
Transformers which is a hugging face

[01:31:32 - 01:31:36]
library and we are loading in the

[01:31:33 - 01:31:38]
sentiment analysis Pipeline and what's

[01:31:36 - 01:31:40]
that going to do is that going to

[01:31:38 - 01:31:42]
download the The Bert based uncase model

[01:31:40 - 01:31:45]
that specifically trained for sentiment

[01:31:42 - 01:31:48]
analysis now I said earlier that Bert it

[01:31:45 - 01:31:50]
in its pre-trained state you wouldn't

[01:31:48 - 01:31:52]
use it for anything right you need to

[01:31:50 - 01:31:54]
train it further uh for those tasks and

[01:31:52 - 01:31:58]
so it doesn't look like it but it is

[01:31:54 - 01:32:00]
actually pulling a a a trained a very

[01:31:58 - 01:32:02]
specifically trained one on this size of

[01:32:00 - 01:32:06]
model and so here we can uh take these

[01:32:02 - 01:32:08]
two sentences and then we can um uh do

[01:32:06 - 01:32:12]
sentiment sentiment analysis on it and

[01:32:08 - 01:32:13]
get a score back so hopefully um that

[01:32:12 - 01:32:15]
makes sense there but yeah you're going

[01:32:13 - 01:32:17]
to see Bert again and again and again so

[01:32:15 - 01:32:21]
it's worth your time to

[01:32:17 - 01:32:23]
[Music]

[01:32:21 - 01:32:24]
learn all right so in this video I want

[01:32:23 - 01:32:26]
to see we can get some hands-on

[01:32:24 - 01:32:28]
experience with Bert so Bert is the

[01:32:26 - 01:32:30]
bidirectional encoder uh representation

[01:32:28 - 01:32:33]
from Transformers uh by the researchers

[01:32:30 - 01:32:35]
at Google and so um I think that we can

[01:32:33 - 01:32:38]
use this to create embeddings and that

[01:32:35 - 01:32:40]
is one use case for it um I don't know

[01:32:38 - 01:32:42]
if Bert actually has anything to do with

[01:32:40 - 01:32:44]
it but it's kind of fun uh seeing Bert

[01:32:42 - 01:32:46]
there since this is a a Google

[01:32:44 - 01:32:48]
researcher thing I think that maybe we

[01:32:46 - 01:32:50]
might want to try to utilize either uh

[01:32:48 - 01:32:52]
Google collab I wouldn't mind also

[01:32:50 - 01:32:54]
popping into vertex Ai and seeing where

[01:32:52 - 01:32:57]
we could run it there um but let's go

[01:32:54 - 01:33:00]
ahead and try with Google collab first I

[01:32:57 - 01:33:02]
am not experienced with uh bird at all

[01:33:00 - 01:33:04]
but I'm sure we can stumble through it

[01:33:02 - 01:33:05]
together and see if we can figure it out

[01:33:04 - 01:33:09]
so I'm going to go ahead and make a new

[01:33:05 - 01:33:13]
notebook and um this will be called uh

[01:33:09 - 01:33:15]
I'll just call this Bert Bert uh

[01:33:13 - 01:33:17]
embeddings simple and so all I want to

[01:33:15 - 01:33:18]
do is figure out a simple way to do that

[01:33:17 - 01:33:20]
now there is an option here to start

[01:33:18 - 01:33:23]
generating code with Gemini so I'm going

[01:33:20 - 01:33:26]
to go ahead and choose that um and say

[01:33:23 - 01:33:28]
you know I want to implement a simple

[01:33:26 - 01:33:30]
embeddings

[01:33:28 - 01:33:34]
example using uh

[01:33:30 - 01:33:35]
BT okay let's see if it can do that for

[01:33:34 - 01:33:38]
us I've never used the Gemini feature in

[01:33:35 - 01:33:40]
here but that was really fast and so

[01:33:38 - 01:33:42]
looking through this I've seen code uh

[01:33:40 - 01:33:45]
around on the internet and this looks

[01:33:42 - 01:33:48]
pretty much exactly like other

[01:33:45 - 01:33:49]
tutorials um so like even off screen

[01:33:48 - 01:33:51]
here I have one from like Chris

[01:33:49 - 01:33:54]
McCormick and I think if I go down here

[01:33:51 - 01:33:56]
you'll notice like you load it you have

[01:33:54 - 01:33:58]
the you're loading it from uh hugging

[01:33:56 - 01:34:00]
face that's where it's coming from okay

[01:33:58 - 01:34:02]
and so similar things here so yeah this

[01:34:00 - 01:34:03]
looks okay if you're wondering where

[01:34:02 - 01:34:06]
this is coming from I'm going to I'm

[01:34:03 - 01:34:07]
going to go um this is hugging face

[01:34:06 - 01:34:09]
right so we're going you're going to see

[01:34:07 - 01:34:11]
it a ton of times but I'll just show it

[01:34:09 - 01:34:12]
again so I'm going to type in this

[01:34:11 - 01:34:15]
Transformers hugging

[01:34:12 - 01:34:16]
face and so this is pretty much what

[01:34:15 - 01:34:18]
we're looking at right here when we're

[01:34:16 - 01:34:21]
utilizing it so I think this is built

[01:34:18 - 01:34:23]
into these are models that are easily

[01:34:21 - 01:34:25]
accessible within hugging face that uh

[01:34:23 - 01:34:29]
are so commonly use that they're just

[01:34:25 - 01:34:31]
kind of plugged into here um

[01:34:29 - 01:34:33]
but uh sorry I just was trying to grab

[01:34:31 - 01:34:35]
the link and put in the slides for folks

[01:34:33 - 01:34:37]
later here I think what's interesting is

[01:34:35 - 01:34:39]
they have a Bert Japanese so since I'm

[01:34:37 - 01:34:41]
learning um uh Japanese language

[01:34:39 - 01:34:44]
learning I'm kind of interested in this

[01:34:41 - 01:34:46]
one and so this looks similar it might

[01:34:44 - 01:34:48]
be a variant of it for embeddings you

[01:34:46 - 01:34:50]
might try it for fun uh not that there's

[01:34:48 - 01:34:51]
anything super exciting about it but

[01:34:50 - 01:34:54]
let's go open this one and see if this

[01:34:51 - 01:34:56]
is actually the example um that we have

[01:34:54 - 01:34:58]
here because they might have a simple

[01:34:56 - 01:35:00]
example here of utilizing it so here's

[01:34:58 - 01:35:03]
BT base unase which is probably the most

[01:35:00 - 01:35:06]
basic one that we can

[01:35:03 - 01:35:08]
utilize no direct

[01:35:06 - 01:35:10]
example oh down here we have one kind of

[01:35:08 - 01:35:11]
but I think this might be fine so let's

[01:35:10 - 01:35:14]
go ahead and take a look here so we have

[01:35:11 - 01:35:16]
Bert tokenizer Bert model from hugging

[01:35:14 - 01:35:18]
phase we're loading the pre-trained

[01:35:16 - 01:35:20]
model called Bert uh base uncase and you

[01:35:18 - 01:35:21]
know I keep saying that you anytime

[01:35:20 - 01:35:24]
there's models on hugging face you can

[01:35:21 - 01:35:25]
look them up right put them in here here

[01:35:24 - 01:35:27]
and we can find them right so if we

[01:35:25 - 01:35:28]
wanted to learn a bit more about this

[01:35:27 - 01:35:31]
one we can read about it pre-train model

[01:35:28 - 01:35:34]
on the English language using a mass uh

[01:35:31 - 01:35:36]
language uh modeling MLM objective so

[01:35:34 - 01:35:39]
here we can read about it and it looks

[01:35:36 - 01:35:42]
like there are some variants of models

[01:35:39 - 01:35:44]
that we could uh swap in here and then

[01:35:42 - 01:35:47]
we have some code here as

[01:35:44 - 01:35:49]
well okay so nothing crazy I'm also just

[01:35:47 - 01:35:51]
kind of curious for deployment

[01:35:49 - 01:35:53]
um I was just trying to see if uh there

[01:35:51 - 01:35:55]
was like a oneclick to Google collab but

[01:35:53 - 01:35:58]
there's not that's totally fine let's go

[01:35:55 - 01:36:02]
back over to here and so here we have

[01:35:58 - 01:36:04]
tokenizer okay and then we're loading

[01:36:02 - 01:36:06]
the models of the weight so loading

[01:36:04 - 01:36:09]
pre-trained model tokenizer so the

[01:36:06 - 01:36:11]
vocabulary then loading the the weights

[01:36:09 - 01:36:15]
okay then we have our text that we want

[01:36:11 - 01:36:16]
to um tokenize which we're basically uh

[01:36:15 - 01:36:17]
yeah we're going to tokenize so we're

[01:36:16 - 01:36:20]
using our

[01:36:17 - 01:36:23]
tokenizer and then

[01:36:20 - 01:36:27]
here compute token embeddings

[01:36:23 - 01:36:30]
yeah I'm not exactly uh sure exactly

[01:36:27 - 01:36:31]
what it is but um I'd say this is fine

[01:36:30 - 01:36:34]
so we'll accept

[01:36:31 - 01:36:36]
this I just want to go ahead and I want

[01:36:34 - 01:36:38]
to see if this can changes so how can I

[01:36:36 - 01:36:39]
print out well it has the sentence and

[01:36:38 - 01:36:41]
Bings down here so it actually does it

[01:36:39 - 01:36:43]
down below here so that's totally fine

[01:36:41 - 01:36:46]
okay so I wasn't 100% certain but let's

[01:36:43 - 01:36:46]
go ahead and see if we can run

[01:36:46 - 01:36:50]
this okay so we'll just give that a

[01:36:52 - 01:36:58]
moment and does it work well it's going

[01:36:56 - 01:36:59]
normally I'd break this up into separate

[01:36:58 - 01:37:02]
lines but since we have this Big Blob

[01:36:59 - 01:37:04]
here I just wanted to see uh what

[01:37:02 - 01:37:08]
results we would

[01:37:04 - 01:37:09]
get so I'll just wait for it to finish

[01:37:08 - 01:37:11]
all right so it has completed and so

[01:37:09 - 01:37:15]
we're getting back um all the embeddings

[01:37:11 - 01:37:17]
you can see there is a a lot of um uh

[01:37:15 - 01:37:18]
stuff in here so I would just be curious

[01:37:17 - 01:37:20]
to see how we would run this on uh

[01:37:18 - 01:37:22]
Google Cloud

[01:37:20 - 01:37:24]
specifically invertex AI if they have a

[01:37:22 - 01:37:26]
similar environment

[01:37:24 - 01:37:27]
um I mean f obviously Google Cod lab is

[01:37:26 - 01:37:28]
fine but I'm just trying to get it

[01:37:27 - 01:37:30]
exposure to more toolings as much as we

[01:37:28 - 01:37:33]
can um so I'm going to go back over to

[01:37:30 - 01:37:35]
here actually maybe to the the B

[01:37:33 - 01:37:36]
Japanese to me is kind of interesting so

[01:37:35 - 01:37:39]
I might try to run this separately as

[01:37:36 - 01:37:40]
well um so let's see if we can run that

[01:37:39 - 01:37:43]
so I'm going to go ahead and just grab

[01:37:40 - 01:37:44]
this code here and by the way I'm just

[01:37:43 - 01:37:48]
going to grab the link here put in notes

[01:37:44 - 01:37:49]
so later on uh we can reference them but

[01:37:48 - 01:37:52]
uh yeah let's go ahead and see if we can

[01:37:49 - 01:37:55]
utilize this one so this one

[01:37:52 - 01:37:58]
has Auto Model Auto tokenizer so we go

[01:37:55 - 01:38:00]
back over here and it's a little bit

[01:37:58 - 01:38:02]
different yeah it's a little bit

[01:38:00 - 01:38:05]
different I'm not sure why it is but

[01:38:02 - 01:38:06]
maybe because it's a more generic model

[01:38:05 - 01:38:09]
it doesn't use Bert and uses the auto

[01:38:06 - 01:38:10]
model I couldn't say for certain but I'm

[01:38:09 - 01:38:15]
going to go ahead and add a new block

[01:38:10 - 01:38:17]
here and we already have um torch should

[01:38:15 - 01:38:20]
already be included above I think it is

[01:38:17 - 01:38:22]
right if we go back to the top here I

[01:38:20 - 01:38:26]
want to clear out this uh this box this

[01:38:22 - 01:38:27]
one's annoying there we go um and we

[01:38:26 - 01:38:30]
already have that imported so I'm going

[01:38:27 - 01:38:33]
to go ahead and bring this one

[01:38:30 - 01:38:36]
in and then we'll grab these

[01:38:33 - 01:38:38]
ones okay we'll bring them

[01:38:36 - 01:38:40]
down and then we will bring in our

[01:38:38 - 01:38:47]
Japanese line

[01:38:40 - 01:38:47]
here what does it say um let me see

[01:38:47 - 01:38:52]
here that looks like Necco Des AI that

[01:38:51 - 01:38:54]
looks like a Neco that looks like a cat

[01:38:52 - 01:38:56]
to me

[01:38:54 - 01:38:58]
I'm not sure about the rest let's go

[01:38:56 - 01:39:01]
find

[01:38:58 - 01:39:07]
out that's the only symbol I recognize I

[01:39:01 - 01:39:10]
am a cat Okay waga Haan NE that is

[01:39:07 - 01:39:13]
that's a fancy way of saying it

[01:39:10 - 01:39:15]
w okay I would just say I would say it a

[01:39:13 - 01:39:17]
much simpler way but my my Japanese

[01:39:15 - 01:39:21]
isn't that advanced we'll go ahead and

[01:39:17 - 01:39:21]
grab the next line here

[01:39:24 - 01:39:28]
and we'll go to our next line

[01:39:30 - 01:39:36]
here and then we

[01:39:32 - 01:39:38]
will grab its outputs examples of using

[01:39:36 - 01:39:40]
the model character uh

[01:39:38 - 01:39:42]
tokenization well hold on hold on hold

[01:39:40 - 01:39:44]
on so this is an example of using a

[01:39:42 - 01:39:46]
model with mecat and word piece

[01:39:44 - 01:39:47]
tokenization okay so up to this point

[01:39:46 - 01:39:49]
that's fine I don't think I care about

[01:39:47 - 01:39:50]
the rest here let's go ahead and see if

[01:39:49 - 01:39:54]
we can run

[01:39:50 - 01:39:55]
this again I'm not saying I understand

[01:39:54 - 01:39:58]
all the stuff I'm just saying like you

[01:39:55 - 01:40:00]
can see how easy is to grab the code and

[01:39:58 - 01:40:03]
get out values but again we need to

[01:40:00 - 01:40:05]
really consult um an expert and so I

[01:40:03 - 01:40:06]
might pull in an expert here to have

[01:40:05 - 01:40:08]
better context other than just starting

[01:40:06 - 01:40:11]
to work with these

[01:40:08 - 01:40:15]
things okay so we have a model error so

[01:40:11 - 01:40:19]
do you install fugashi to use that

[01:40:15 - 01:40:24]
[Music]

[01:40:19 - 01:40:26]
okay so open this up in a new tab here

[01:40:24 - 01:40:28]
and yeah we'll go ahead and just install

[01:40:26 - 01:40:31]
this so I'll just bring this down a line

[01:40:28 - 01:40:33]
here we'll just say um percentage pip

[01:40:31 - 01:40:33]
install

[01:40:34 - 01:40:38]
fugashi and I'm trying to remember like

[01:40:36 - 01:40:41]
maob is um I think it's like a

[01:40:38 - 01:40:44]
dictionary I used it before uh in

[01:40:41 - 01:40:46]
preparing for the free geni boot camp

[01:40:44 - 01:40:49]
but there were uh these things that if

[01:40:46 - 01:40:52]
you gave them Japanese text it could

[01:40:49 - 01:40:54]
break down its form uh based on a

[01:40:52 - 01:40:56]
dictionary so I believe that this is a

[01:40:54 - 01:40:58]
basis for that maob dictionary that it

[01:40:56 - 01:41:02]
wants we don't see maob here it's

[01:40:58 - 01:41:04]
somewhere underneath um as a library and

[01:41:02 - 01:41:06]
saying this isn't installed either okay

[01:41:04 - 01:41:09]
so we'll get that as

[01:41:06 - 01:41:11]
well so I'll just dump it here on the

[01:41:09 - 01:41:12]
end and eventually we'll get everything

[01:41:11 - 01:41:14]
installed now we might have to restart

[01:41:12 - 01:41:17]
the run time sometimes you have to do

[01:41:14 - 01:41:17]
that but we'll go ahead and try

[01:41:18 - 01:41:23]
this okay but working with um anything

[01:41:21 - 01:41:25]
with llms you're constantly having to

[01:41:23 - 01:41:27]
fiddle with a library so it's totally

[01:41:25 - 01:41:28]
not unusual for this to happen you could

[01:41:27 - 01:41:31]
be writing this later on and you could

[01:41:28 - 01:41:33]
be getting total errors and everything

[01:41:31 - 01:41:34]
is um they're like Andrew why doesn't

[01:41:33 - 01:41:38]
your code just work it's just the space

[01:41:34 - 01:41:41]
is very um uh it's just how it is right

[01:41:38 - 01:41:42]
so that Library looks like it is now

[01:41:41 - 01:41:44]
installed let's right the next one and

[01:41:42 - 01:41:46]
there we go so we got some output here

[01:41:44 - 01:41:47]
and so it looks like we have um some

[01:41:46 - 01:41:50]
special things or saying this is the

[01:41:47 - 01:41:52]
start this is our separator so these are

[01:41:50 - 01:41:55]
um specific indicators and then maybe I

[01:41:52 - 01:41:57]
guess it's a identifying this as the

[01:41:55 - 01:41:59]
section of the

[01:41:57 - 01:42:01]
sentence um so again don't fully

[01:41:59 - 01:42:02]
understand it but the point is we're

[01:42:01 - 01:42:04]
able to get a run I just like to do one

[01:42:02 - 01:42:09]
more thing here is if we can try to go

[01:42:04 - 01:42:10]
do this on um Google Cloud so here in

[01:42:09 - 01:42:12]
hugging face they'll have options like

[01:42:10 - 01:42:13]
deploy and I rarely ever touch this I'm

[01:42:12 - 01:42:15]
just kind of curious what would happen

[01:42:13 - 01:42:17]
if we do deploy with Google Cloud code

[01:42:15 - 01:42:19]
spaces now I have a Google Cloud account

[01:42:17 - 01:42:20]
so you'd obviously have to make one and

[01:42:19 - 01:42:21]
we're in vertex Ai and it's opened up

[01:42:20 - 01:42:23]
model Garden which I'm actually

[01:42:21 - 01:42:25]
surprised that it's in here

[01:42:23 - 01:42:29]
um so it says open models on hugging

[01:42:25 - 01:42:32]
face now if you do not have uh if you do

[01:42:29 - 01:42:34]
not have um any room for spend do not do

[01:42:32 - 01:42:36]
this I'm just doing this to kind of

[01:42:34 - 01:42:38]
explore it together so we can just

[01:42:36 - 01:42:40]
together see what we can get as a result

[01:42:38 - 01:42:41]
if you've never pressed that button so

[01:42:40 - 01:42:43]
please don't do this because this might

[01:42:41 - 01:42:45]
cost something and I want to have you to

[01:42:43 - 01:42:47]
stay in the free tier so here it wants

[01:42:45 - 01:42:49]
to deploy it to vertex AI which is the

[01:42:47 - 01:42:51]
fully managed AI platform if you never

[01:42:49 - 01:42:53]
heard of vertex AI you can think of it

[01:42:51 - 01:42:56]
similar to Stage maker Studio Labs or

[01:42:53 - 01:42:57]
Azure ml studio and then down below

[01:42:56 - 01:42:58]
we're bringing the model we have our

[01:42:57 - 01:43:00]
endpoint we have a place we want to

[01:42:58 - 01:43:01]
deploy it there are the machine specs

[01:43:00 - 01:43:03]
which there is nothing displayed here

[01:43:01 - 01:43:05]
your endpoint will be deployed with the

[01:43:03 - 01:43:07]
following settings so it doesn't look

[01:43:05 - 01:43:11]
like we get to choose but it's going to

[01:43:07 - 01:43:13]
use a C3 High CPU for accelerate type

[01:43:11 - 01:43:14]
unspecified um and then we' get an end

[01:43:13 - 01:43:15]
point that we would hit but I'm not

[01:43:14 - 01:43:18]
exactly sure how I would end up

[01:43:15 - 01:43:19]
utilizing this um so I have to select

[01:43:18 - 01:43:21]
something but I have no options here and

[01:43:19 - 01:43:24]
maybe the reason I have no options is

[01:43:21 - 01:43:25]
because I don't have uh access to this

[01:43:24 - 01:43:26]
um this item here so I'm going to go

[01:43:25 - 01:43:28]
ahead and just search for what this is

[01:43:26 - 01:43:32]
in in

[01:43:28 - 01:43:37]
Google like I want to know its cost

[01:43:32 - 01:43:37]
right um so this one here is a

[01:43:38 - 01:43:43]
C3 C3

[01:43:41 - 01:43:46]
Series so Zeon scalable processors

[01:43:43 - 01:43:49]
fourth generation

[01:43:46 - 01:43:51]
okay Titan

[01:43:49 - 01:43:52]
titanium this doesn't seem like

[01:43:51 - 01:43:54]
something that I I I would not not have

[01:43:52 - 01:43:57]
access say

[01:43:54 - 01:43:59]
too uh custom built security

[01:43:57 - 01:44:01]
microcontrollers okay that's not gpus

[01:43:59 - 01:44:03]
but it seems like maybe this is ried on

[01:44:01 - 01:44:05]
CPUs and not

[01:44:03 - 01:44:06]
gpus that's what we're always looking

[01:44:05 - 01:44:09]
for like what are we running this on and

[01:44:06 - 01:44:11]
so I'm pretty sure yeah this is running

[01:44:09 - 01:44:13]
on this is running on CPUs the question

[01:44:11 - 01:44:17]
is like why don't I have access to

[01:44:13 - 01:44:19]
launch one so um maybe I go back over to

[01:44:17 - 01:44:23]
Let's go ask Google

[01:44:19 - 01:44:23]
Gemini uh Google Gemini

[01:44:24 - 01:44:29]
I think they have a free tier still and

[01:44:26 - 01:44:33]
so um let's go ahead and find out why I

[01:44:29 - 01:44:36]
can launch this so I'm looking for here

[01:44:33 - 01:44:36]
into uh

[01:44:36 - 01:44:44]
here

[01:44:38 - 01:44:47]
and I can't seem to launch uh how do I

[01:44:44 - 01:44:51]
get um

[01:44:47 - 01:44:52]
quota within Google Cloud cuz maybe I

[01:44:51 - 01:44:55]
have to put in a service uh limiter

[01:44:52 - 01:44:57]
request I yeah quota limits and so it

[01:44:55 - 01:44:58]
says navigate to the quota page oh it's

[01:44:57 - 01:45:01]
just

[01:44:58 - 01:45:04]
quotas you think I know but um honestly

[01:45:01 - 01:45:06]
I don't change quotas very

[01:45:04 - 01:45:09]
often right oh by the way this launched

[01:45:06 - 01:45:10]
me into an existing project you may have

[01:45:09 - 01:45:11]
to create a project before even doing

[01:45:10 - 01:45:13]
any of this but I'm going to go here

[01:45:11 - 01:45:15]
first and let's see if we can find

[01:45:13 - 01:45:19]
quotas you got to spell right if you

[01:45:15 - 01:45:19]
want to show up so go over to

[01:45:20 - 01:45:24]
here okay

[01:45:23 - 01:45:26]
and we might not be able to run this

[01:45:24 - 01:45:27]
today because if I don't have access to

[01:45:26 - 01:45:28]
it and it takes too long then I might

[01:45:27 - 01:45:30]
not be able to complete this but that's

[01:45:28 - 01:45:33]
totally fine and so in here they're

[01:45:30 - 01:45:36]
saying go to the quotas

[01:45:33 - 01:45:37]
page identify the limiting quota look

[01:45:36 - 01:45:39]
for the quota that's preventing you from

[01:45:37 - 01:45:43]
launching instance so here we go now we

[01:45:39 - 01:45:45]
have um some things here and this is

[01:45:43 - 01:45:48]
[Music]

[01:45:45 - 01:45:51]
within where are we we are in um vertex

[01:45:48 - 01:45:54]
AI so I'm not sure if this would be

[01:45:51 - 01:45:56]
under vertex AI or just general compute

[01:45:54 - 01:45:58]
engine API because that's what it might

[01:45:56 - 01:46:00]
be utilizing underneath

[01:45:58 - 01:46:05]
here

[01:46:00 - 01:46:05]
um so that is what we need to find

[01:46:06 - 01:46:11]
here I wish they had like a simple

[01:46:08 - 01:46:14]
search oh they do maybe okay so let's

[01:46:11 - 01:46:14]
say vertex

[01:46:15 - 01:46:19]
AI

[01:46:17 - 01:46:22]
okay

[01:46:19 - 01:46:25]
and we do have some options so what I'm

[01:46:22 - 01:46:27]
looking looking

[01:46:25 - 01:46:32]
for is the region we're in right now

[01:46:27 - 01:46:34]
we're in Iowa I believe yeah or yeah

[01:46:32 - 01:46:36]
Iowa so somewhere here we're going to

[01:46:34 - 01:46:36]
have

[01:46:39 - 01:46:45]
Iowa actually what region is

[01:46:42 - 01:46:47]
Iowa us Central 1 okay so we're looking

[01:46:45 - 01:46:51]
for us Central

[01:46:47 - 01:46:52]
1 US Central one so that would be this

[01:46:51 - 01:46:54]
one here

[01:46:52 - 01:46:57]
it says

[01:46:54 - 01:46:57]
five

[01:46:57 - 01:47:02]
H okay let's click into this one

[01:47:02 - 01:47:06]
here to use this API you may need

[01:47:04 - 01:47:08]
credentials

[01:47:06 - 01:47:12]
okay

[01:47:08 - 01:47:15]
um I mean I don't want credentials per

[01:47:12 - 01:47:17]
se I just want to be able to launch this

[01:47:15 - 01:47:19]
[Music]

[01:47:17 - 01:47:21]
here so I feel that if I was to create

[01:47:19 - 01:47:22]
credentials that wouldn't necessarily

[01:47:21 - 01:47:24]
make it work but let's go ahead and

[01:47:22 - 01:47:26]
press it anyway it says the API is

[01:47:24 - 01:47:29]
enabled so yeah that's not my

[01:47:26 - 01:47:32]
problem dat belonging to Google user so

[01:47:29 - 01:47:33]
yeah I'm not okay let's go look take a

[01:47:32 - 01:47:35]
look here so look for quota that's

[01:47:33 - 01:47:37]
preventing you from launching instances

[01:47:35 - 01:47:39]
such as vcpus compare the current usage

[01:47:37 - 01:47:42]
use the request quota increase button on

[01:47:39 - 01:47:45]
the quota page provide details for

[01:47:42 - 01:47:49]
information um yeah I'm not I'm not sure

[01:47:45 - 01:47:51]
let's go back over to here uh to to here

[01:47:49 - 01:47:54]
let's just back out for a

[01:47:51 - 01:47:56]
second and

[01:47:54 - 01:47:59]
and back one more time back one more

[01:47:56 - 01:48:01]
time back one more

[01:47:59 - 01:48:02]
time and I think I might want to try is

[01:48:01 - 01:48:04]
just typing in

[01:48:02 - 01:48:06]
C3 because that's the type of compute

[01:48:04 - 01:48:10]
we're looking for

[01:48:06 - 01:48:10]
right C3

[01:48:10 - 01:48:17]
CPUs and it says unlimited and value8 so

[01:48:14 - 01:48:21]
we definitely have access to

[01:48:17 - 01:48:24]
these um why there's two I don't

[01:48:21 - 01:48:25]
know but let just open this one here and

[01:48:24 - 01:48:27]
then open that one here I just want to

[01:48:25 - 01:48:31]
see if something's not enabled no this

[01:48:27 - 01:48:32]
is enabled as well this is enabled as

[01:48:31 - 01:48:35]
well oh my goodness let's go back over

[01:48:32 - 01:48:37]
to here and I'm just going to figure it

[01:48:35 - 01:48:39]
out I'll be back in just a moment okay

[01:48:37 - 01:48:40]
you know another thought I have is like

[01:48:39 - 01:48:42]
do I have to create a machine spec

[01:48:40 - 01:48:43]
before this and maybe there because

[01:48:42 - 01:48:44]
there's no item because I didn't create

[01:48:43 - 01:48:46]
one and that's kind of like what I'm

[01:48:44 - 01:48:48]
thinking now so I'm going to go ahead

[01:48:46 - 01:48:49]
and just open up a new tab cuz I don't

[01:48:48 - 01:48:51]
think we have a service limit issue here

[01:48:49 - 01:48:54]
maybe we just have to create a machine

[01:48:51 - 01:48:58]
spec um I'm not exactly sure where we

[01:48:54 - 01:49:00]
would create that but um let's go over

[01:48:58 - 01:49:03]
and oh I don't want to launch

[01:49:00 - 01:49:05]
flux let's go into like llama 3.12 but

[01:49:03 - 01:49:07]
these are ones that we can easily deploy

[01:49:05 - 01:49:09]
yeah now see that we're seeing machine

[01:49:07 - 01:49:12]
specs right and we didn't specify

[01:49:09 - 01:49:15]
machine specs I'm not sure why your quot

[01:49:12 - 01:49:18]
limit for the Nvidia 4 C Central 2 is

[01:49:15 - 01:49:20]
zero usage so it could be maybe it's

[01:49:18 - 01:49:23]
just where we're launching it let's go

[01:49:20 - 01:49:25]
see if we switch to another region like

[01:49:23 - 01:49:26]
all

[01:49:25 - 01:49:29]
nothing

[01:49:26 - 01:49:32]
Toronto nothing this is really odd okay

[01:49:29 - 01:49:35]
so what I'm going to do I'm just going

[01:49:32 - 01:49:36]
to ignore this for a second um and I'm

[01:49:35 - 01:49:37]
just going to go back to the model

[01:49:36 - 01:49:42]
Garden here and let's see if we can find

[01:49:37 - 01:49:44]
Bert this way so I can just type in

[01:49:42 - 01:49:49]
Bert okay because we're just looking for

[01:49:44 - 01:49:50]
generic Bert um fine tune deploy B I

[01:49:49 - 01:49:51]
don't want to fine tune it I just want

[01:49:50 - 01:49:54]
to use

[01:49:51 - 01:49:56]
it neural network based Tech uh

[01:49:54 - 01:49:58]
technique for natural language

[01:49:56 - 01:50:00]
processing um again I don't want to

[01:49:58 - 01:50:04]
train it per

[01:50:00 - 01:50:09]
se but we will click into this

[01:50:04 - 01:50:12]
one and again that's trying to fine tune

[01:50:09 - 01:50:13]
it but maybe that's what it wants to do

[01:50:12 - 01:50:16]
when it launches it what if we click

[01:50:13 - 01:50:18]
fine tune what do we get I just want to

[01:50:16 - 01:50:20]
see if we get that window that we have

[01:50:18 - 01:50:21]
no no this is not what we want at all

[01:50:20 - 01:50:23]
cuz we just want to launch it we just

[01:50:21 - 01:50:24]
want to launch it at pre-made model

[01:50:23 - 01:50:27]
that's all we want to do we don't want

[01:50:24 - 01:50:30]
to create a pipeline here today um so

[01:50:27 - 01:50:31]
that's not exactly what I was hoping for

[01:50:30 - 01:50:35]
um but clearly there is some way to

[01:50:31 - 01:50:38]
deploy it but it's not showing up here

[01:50:35 - 01:50:40]
today let me just try this one more

[01:50:38 - 01:50:42]
time worst case we could just go

[01:50:40 - 01:50:44]
somewhere else like Amazon Sage maker I

[01:50:42 - 01:50:48]
just really wanted to do it

[01:50:44 - 01:50:48]
here yeah we just don't have any machine

[01:50:48 - 01:50:53]
specs odd odd

[01:50:50 - 01:50:55]
odd so let's go back

[01:50:53 - 01:50:57]
over anyway I'm going to try to check uh

[01:50:55 - 01:50:59]
service quotas one more time but if I

[01:50:57 - 01:51:01]
can't figure it out we'll just uh roll

[01:50:59 - 01:51:03]
back on this okay so one thing I just

[01:51:01 - 01:51:06]
wanted to do was a sanity check and I

[01:51:03 - 01:51:08]
made my way over to um uh Google compute

[01:51:06 - 01:51:11]
engine and I can see C3 right here and I

[01:51:08 - 01:51:12]
can select it and there doesn't seem to

[01:51:11 - 01:51:14]
be any restrictions for me launching it

[01:51:12 - 01:51:16]
remember I said earlier it can get

[01:51:14 - 01:51:19]
expensive well 20 cents for me is not

[01:51:16 - 01:51:21]
that bad but I just don't understand why

[01:51:19 - 01:51:23]
I can't select it but that's totally

[01:51:21 - 01:51:24]
fine so I don't we're going to be able

[01:51:23 - 01:51:27]
to launch it there with Google Gemini

[01:51:24 - 01:51:29]
here today um so that one is a bust that

[01:51:27 - 01:51:32]
doesn't mean we won't use vertex later

[01:51:29 - 01:51:33]
on but maybe we could deploy this over

[01:51:32 - 01:51:35]
to Sage maker now I know Sage maker

[01:51:33 - 01:51:38]
really really well AZ your ml I'm all

[01:51:35 - 01:51:41]
right with it and so here's another

[01:51:38 - 01:51:43]
example and so Sage maker sometimes has

[01:51:41 - 01:51:46]
jump starts like what they're already

[01:51:43 - 01:51:49]
pre-made but it doesn't look like it has

[01:51:46 - 01:51:50]
um uh much here just looks like it has

[01:51:49 - 01:51:53]
some

[01:51:50 - 01:51:55]
code so here it kind look similar but

[01:51:53 - 01:51:57]
notice that it's bringing in Bodo 3 and

[01:51:55 - 01:51:59]
Sage maker so it has a sage maker

[01:51:57 - 01:52:01]
variant of the hugging face model that

[01:51:59 - 01:52:01]
we can

[01:52:01 - 01:52:09]
utilize okay

[01:52:05 - 01:52:09]
um so I mean this is

[01:52:10 - 01:52:16]
fine but this is not doing embeddings

[01:52:13 - 01:52:18]
per se so I don't know um this kind of

[01:52:16 - 01:52:21]
curious what happens if I click

[01:52:18 - 01:52:23]
this oh so this is the ads infr okay so

[01:52:21 - 01:52:24]
it's just slightly different code so

[01:52:23 - 01:52:27]
this is just if you wanted to run it on

[01:52:24 - 01:52:29]
um ad's AI accelerators or trainers the

[01:52:27 - 01:52:30]
code would be a little bit different

[01:52:29 - 01:52:31]
yeah there's no jump start I'm not sure

[01:52:30 - 01:52:32]
why they mean cloud formation I guess

[01:52:31 - 01:52:34]
they just mean that they'll have a cloud

[01:52:32 - 01:52:37]
information example so that's kind of a

[01:52:34 - 01:52:39]
bust let's go take a look at Azure ML

[01:52:37 - 01:52:43]
and here they say create a workspace

[01:52:39 - 01:52:45]
discover and deploy models via there and

[01:52:43 - 01:52:46]
yeah their examples aren't any better so

[01:52:45 - 01:52:50]
sometimes this stuff is good sometimes

[01:52:46 - 01:52:52]
it's not and uh you know that's just

[01:52:50 - 01:52:55]
what it is now we could still run this

[01:52:52 - 01:52:58]
um on um any of those platforms but I

[01:52:55 - 01:52:59]
just wanted a a oneclick solution so you

[01:52:58 - 01:53:00]
know I think we're done here for Bert

[01:52:59 - 01:53:03]
but this exp exploration is fine you can

[01:53:00 - 01:53:04]
just see how sometimes these

[01:53:03 - 01:53:07]
conveniences look like conveniences but

[01:53:04 - 01:53:10]
they're not okay anyway I will see you

[01:53:07 - 01:53:10]
in the next one okay

[01:53:12 - 01:53:17]
ciao you hear me well yeah I hear you

[01:53:15 - 01:53:20]
good cool hey everyone it's Andrew Brown

[01:53:17 - 01:53:24]
and welcome to another video I have Rola

[01:53:20 - 01:53:26]
who is definely an expert comparative to

[01:53:24 - 01:53:28]
me which I I know nothing as you just

[01:53:26 - 01:53:30]
heard me talking about Bert but let's

[01:53:28 - 01:53:33]
see if we can actually find out really

[01:53:30 - 01:53:34]
how Bert Works um and so I have my

[01:53:33 - 01:53:38]
slides pulled up here let's bring them

[01:53:34 - 01:53:40]
up here and uh R is going to help us

[01:53:38 - 01:53:42]
enrich the information I have so when I

[01:53:40 - 01:53:45]
learned about Bert I actually uh learned

[01:53:42 - 01:53:47]
about it in the machine learning um ad

[01:53:45 - 01:53:49]
certification I didn't think much of it

[01:53:47 - 01:53:51]
because I thought it was old and maybe

[01:53:49 - 01:53:53]
uh folks don't use it anymore but I was

[01:53:51 - 01:53:54]
at an event with Rola

[01:53:53 - 01:53:57]
um at the adus Montreal user group and I

[01:53:54 - 01:53:59]
heard her say there are use cases where

[01:53:57 - 01:54:04]
you can still use Bert or should use

[01:53:59 - 01:54:06]
Bert where LMS um might be uh too much

[01:54:04 - 01:54:08]
too much work and so I wanted to kind of

[01:54:06 - 01:54:10]
dig a little bit more into that um and

[01:54:08 - 01:54:13]
so I have my slides up for display here

[01:54:10 - 01:54:14]
for Rola and so I understand Bert to be

[01:54:13 - 01:54:17]
this bidirectional encoder

[01:54:14 - 01:54:19]
representation from Transformers it was

[01:54:17 - 01:54:22]
uh researched by Google and uh you know

[01:54:19 - 01:54:24]
I saw a video which showed the for

[01:54:22 - 01:54:26]
architecture and what they did is they

[01:54:24 - 01:54:27]
just split it in half and took the first

[01:54:26 - 01:54:30]
part of the architecture and stacked it

[01:54:27 - 01:54:33]
and they called that b so is that true

[01:54:30 - 01:54:37]
is it just cut in half and then stacked

[01:54:33 - 01:54:38]
well so um Transformers come I they have

[01:54:37 - 01:54:41]
two pieces right they they've got the

[01:54:38 - 01:54:44]
encoder piece which encodes data so it

[01:54:41 - 01:54:46]
takes um natural language and encodes it

[01:54:44 - 01:54:48]
uh into mathematical representation and

[01:54:46 - 01:54:50]
then you've got a decoder where if

[01:54:48 - 01:54:52]
you've got mathematical representation

[01:54:50 - 01:54:56]
you can pass it through a decod and get

[01:54:52 - 01:55:00]
natural language right and um the first

[01:54:56 - 01:55:03]
generation I think of um llms came as an

[01:55:00 - 01:55:04]
encoder decoder couple and so you would

[01:55:03 - 01:55:07]
put in natural language it goes through

[01:55:04 - 01:55:09]
this mathematical system and then it

[01:55:07 - 01:55:11]
would you would still get

[01:55:09 - 01:55:15]
um uh language out of it exactly that so

[01:55:11 - 01:55:18]
there's a encoder decoder um gpts for

[01:55:15 - 01:55:21]
example are a decoder only but Bert

[01:55:18 - 01:55:24]
itself is an encoder only model um and

[01:55:21 - 01:55:26]
so what that means is it takes you have

[01:55:24 - 01:55:30]
to think of these things as what is the

[01:55:26 - 01:55:33]
input and what is the output and so uh

[01:55:30 - 01:55:37]
an encoder only model uh takes in

[01:55:33 - 01:55:39]
natural language or or takes in um for

[01:55:37 - 01:55:41]
for in our case in a language model

[01:55:39 - 01:55:43]
takes natural language and then it comes

[01:55:41 - 01:55:46]
out with a natur with a mathematical

[01:55:43 - 01:55:50]
representation right and so what birth

[01:55:46 - 01:55:52]
is and then you add a few layers of um

[01:55:50 - 01:55:55]
you know these These Things Are neural

[01:55:52 - 01:55:57]
Nets at the at the heart of them and so

[01:55:55 - 01:55:59]
you add a few layers and and you can um

[01:55:57 - 01:56:01]
come up with different representations

[01:55:59 - 01:56:02]
and so what Bert is really good at is

[01:56:01 - 01:56:05]
things like sentiment analysis for

[01:56:02 - 01:56:08]
example or classification um so you

[01:56:05 - 01:56:11]
think of it as input is text a lot of

[01:56:08 - 01:56:16]
text and output is less text so either a

[01:56:11 - 01:56:18]
word or um a s a sentiment a

[01:56:16 - 01:56:19]
classification something like that does

[01:56:18 - 01:56:22]
that make

[01:56:19 - 01:56:25]
sense yeah and one thing that I I I I

[01:56:22 - 01:56:27]
think I got from that as well is that

[01:56:25 - 01:56:28]
you were saying that Bert if we go back

[01:56:27 - 01:56:30]
here to the architectural diagram and I

[01:56:28 - 01:56:31]
just want to confirm if this is what I

[01:56:30 - 01:56:32]
understood I'm trying to get one of

[01:56:31 - 01:56:34]
these images a little bit larger here

[01:56:32 - 01:56:36]
it's a little bit hard today I'm not

[01:56:34 - 01:56:37]
sure why it's uh making it hard for me

[01:56:36 - 01:56:39]
but I want to go back to that

[01:56:37 - 01:56:41]
Transformer

[01:56:39 - 01:56:43]
architecture um and I just want to make

[01:56:41 - 01:56:45]
it a little bit larger if I can here so

[01:56:43 - 01:56:47]
just give me a moment here to get the

[01:56:45 - 01:56:49]
link so I'm just copying the link

[01:56:47 - 01:56:52]
address here and so here is the

[01:56:49 - 01:56:55]
Transformer architecture and you said

[01:56:52 - 01:56:58]
well I said Bert's just this side

[01:56:55 - 01:57:00]
stacked uh over onto itself and that's

[01:56:58 - 01:57:02]
what we get for Bert but I think you had

[01:57:00 - 01:57:05]
suggested that GPT is the right side

[01:57:02 - 01:57:06]
that is stacked upon itself or is it if

[01:57:05 - 01:57:09]
you just took the right side would that

[01:57:06 - 01:57:13]
be considered GPT yeah GPT are decoder

[01:57:09 - 01:57:16]
only models I mean in a nutshell yes uh

[01:57:13 - 01:57:17]
but yes so they're they're not uh

[01:57:16 - 01:57:19]
they're not encoder decoder they're

[01:57:17 - 01:57:22]
decoder only

[01:57:19 - 01:57:25]
models okay interesting uh so let's go

[01:57:22 - 01:57:28]
over into the next part of Bert um and

[01:57:25 - 01:57:30]
so yeah so Bert is bidirectional meaning

[01:57:28 - 01:57:31]
it can read texts both from left to

[01:57:30 - 01:57:34]
right right to left to understand the

[01:57:31 - 01:57:36]
context of text sorry that's not exactly

[01:57:34 - 01:57:38]
what it means it's supposed to be non

[01:57:36 - 01:57:40]
the naming is a misnomer um it's

[01:57:38 - 01:57:41]
non-direct it should be named

[01:57:40 - 01:57:44]
non-directional it's called B

[01:57:41 - 01:57:47]
directional the idea is that it doesn't

[01:57:44 - 01:57:50]
the sequence of words often matter right

[01:57:47 - 01:57:52]
um and so if you

[01:57:50 - 01:57:56]
say um

[01:57:52 - 01:57:58]
I don't know um a killed b or B killed a

[01:57:56 - 01:58:01]
it it's a very different understanding

[01:57:58 - 01:58:06]
of how things are and so traditionally

[01:58:01 - 01:58:08]
the way it worked is um we had rnns and

[01:58:06 - 01:58:09]
different variations of recurring neural

[01:58:08 - 01:58:14]
networks and the way they did that is

[01:58:09 - 01:58:15]
through sequential understanding um the

[01:58:14 - 01:58:18]
the Transformer architecture changes

[01:58:15 - 01:58:21]
that and attention changes that in that

[01:58:18 - 01:58:24]
um that sequence is understood

[01:58:21 - 01:58:27]
differently not not sequentially and

[01:58:24 - 01:58:28]
this is why the non- directionality

[01:58:27 - 01:58:31]
comes in I

[01:58:28 - 01:58:33]
think okay so all right so that makes

[01:58:31 - 01:58:35]
sense so takes in all of the data at

[01:58:33 - 01:58:37]
once it doesn't read right to left nor

[01:58:35 - 01:58:40]
right right left to right it just takes

[01:58:37 - 01:58:43]
in all the data uh but internally it

[01:58:40 - 01:58:46]
works in a mechanism where um it is not

[01:58:43 - 01:58:48]
reading through a sequence it's really

[01:58:46 - 01:58:52]
the the attention mechanism make it so

[01:58:48 - 01:58:55]
that it can highlight certain words um

[01:58:52 - 01:58:59]
in association to others okay so so uh

[01:58:55 - 01:59:01]
have you ever seen the movie um um uh

[01:58:59 - 01:59:04]
it's a comic book

[01:59:01 - 01:59:06]
movie um have you heard of Dr Manhattan

[01:59:04 - 01:59:10]
have you ever SE heard of Dr Manhattan

[01:59:06 - 01:59:15]
so Dr Manhattan is uh uh he's all

[01:59:10 - 01:59:17]
knowing not like he becomes um uh I

[01:59:15 - 01:59:19]
don't know he becomes like kind of like

[01:59:17 - 01:59:21]
a God and he and he's aware of

[01:59:19 - 01:59:24]
everything all at once at all time so

[01:59:21 - 01:59:26]
would we interpret its understanding as

[01:59:24 - 01:59:28]
it contextually is aware of all the

[01:59:26 - 01:59:30]
words in all directions would that be a

[01:59:28 - 01:59:35]
better description

[01:59:30 - 01:59:37]
or um I think the w i it is aware aware

[01:59:35 - 01:59:39]
of all of the words but it is able to

[01:59:37 - 01:59:41]
give certain words more importance based

[01:59:39 - 01:59:44]
on what it understands of language so

[01:59:41 - 01:59:47]
there's a combination of things where

[01:59:44 - 01:59:48]
one language uh where one word kind of

[01:59:47 - 01:59:51]
enhances

[01:59:48 - 01:59:53]
another um and the it starts to pick up

[01:59:51 - 01:59:56]
these nuances of word connections based

[01:59:53 - 01:59:58]
on its own training so it is aware of

[01:59:56 - 02:00:01]
all of the words it just understands

[01:59:58 - 02:00:04]
which words it really needs to focus

[02:00:01 - 02:00:08]
on right all of the articles for example

[02:00:04 - 02:00:10]
doesn't necessarily care for

[02:00:08 - 02:00:14]
um does that make sense yeah yeah it's

[02:00:10 - 02:00:16]
contextually aware okay so aware

[02:00:14 - 02:00:17]
extion see instead of think instead of

[02:00:16 - 02:00:18]
thinking of like it's reading left to

[02:00:17 - 02:00:20]
right just understand that it's

[02:00:18 - 02:00:22]
contextually aware of each word and it's

[02:00:20 - 02:00:23]
important in a sentence okay

[02:00:22 - 02:00:25]
and the movie I was thinking of is

[02:00:23 - 02:00:27]
called

[02:00:25 - 02:00:29]
Watchman if anybody cares I don't know

[02:00:27 - 02:00:32]
why I I just uh I had to I had to

[02:00:29 - 02:00:33]
remember what the movie was um so Bert

[02:00:32 - 02:00:35]
is a pre-trained model on the following

[02:00:33 - 02:00:38]
task so two things that it says it does

[02:00:35 - 02:00:40]
is mass language modeling so MLL and the

[02:00:38 - 02:00:42]
other one is next sentence prediction

[02:00:40 - 02:00:44]
NSP so you know my thoughts is like you

[02:00:42 - 02:00:46]
train the model based on these two

[02:00:44 - 02:00:48]
things does that mean in its pre-trained

[02:00:46 - 02:00:50]
state like it's been trained for these

[02:00:48 - 02:00:54]
two things that that's all it can do at

[02:00:50 - 02:00:56]
this point is like it Can it can uh uh

[02:00:54 - 02:00:57]
infer if you were to do these two tasks

[02:00:56 - 02:00:59]
it would be able to do it in this state

[02:00:57 - 02:01:01]
because I was trying to figure out what

[02:00:59 - 02:01:02]
can you do with this model I assume you

[02:01:01 - 02:01:04]
can't do anything model unless you train

[02:01:02 - 02:01:07]
it again but can you do anything with it

[02:01:04 - 02:01:09]
in it in the in the uh non-trained state

[02:01:07 - 02:01:11]
or sorry the pre-train

[02:01:09 - 02:01:13]
state um I think there's a lot so

[02:01:11 - 02:01:16]
there's there's something called

[02:01:13 - 02:01:18]
emergent tasks in llms where you train

[02:01:16 - 02:01:19]
it for a specific thing but it turns out

[02:01:18 - 02:01:22]
it does this other thing really well and

[02:01:19 - 02:01:24]
we call that an emergent task um and

[02:01:22 - 02:01:27]
we're learning that the bigger the model

[02:01:24 - 02:01:29]
uh size then the more emerging tasks it

[02:01:27 - 02:01:30]
it has so the fact that it is

[02:01:29 - 02:01:32]
pre-trained on these things then we know

[02:01:30 - 02:01:35]
that it can do these things because it

[02:01:32 - 02:01:37]
has been trained on them um but there

[02:01:35 - 02:01:39]
has been a lot of emerging tasks and a

[02:01:37 - 02:01:41]
lot of uh I think a lot of people were

[02:01:39 - 02:01:45]
surprised at how much for example that

[02:01:41 - 02:01:46]
gpts can do um in terms of solving

[02:01:45 - 02:01:48]
different problems and that's because of

[02:01:46 - 02:01:52]
the size now Bert is a model that is

[02:01:48 - 02:01:54]
about 340 million so it is a couple of

[02:01:52 - 02:01:55]
orders of magnitude smaller than our

[02:01:54 - 02:01:59]
bigger models you have to remember this

[02:01:55 - 02:02:00]
is one of the first one of the few first

[02:01:59 - 02:02:02]
models that came in the Transformer

[02:02:00 - 02:02:03]
architecture came out in 2017 this is

[02:02:02 - 02:02:08]
this came out in

[02:02:03 - 02:02:11]
2018 um so it is one of the first models

[02:02:08 - 02:02:14]
it is one of the smaller models at 340

[02:02:11 - 02:02:17]
billion um the gpts right now are about

[02:02:14 - 02:02:20]
1.2 trillion so it's about a couple of

[02:02:17 - 02:02:23]
order of magnitudes bigger so I'm sure I

[02:02:20 - 02:02:26]
can do more than that um I have to

[02:02:23 - 02:02:27]
remember use cases I have seen it we

[02:02:26 - 02:02:29]
have projects where we are running

[02:02:27 - 02:02:33]
sentiment analysis and and

[02:02:29 - 02:02:35]
classification uh with Bert but um I'm

[02:02:33 - 02:02:38]
sure there's other things that it can do

[02:02:35 - 02:02:41]
I just haven't uh played with it enough

[02:02:38 - 02:02:43]
okay so so that that word emergent

[02:02:41 - 02:02:46]
emergent uh did you say emergent models

[02:02:43 - 02:02:49]
or emergent emergent tasks or eerg tasks

[02:02:46 - 02:02:51]
yeah things that can do so so again to

[02:02:49 - 02:02:53]
to ground it to a real world example I'm

[02:02:51 - 02:02:55]
going to keep doing this as a real world

[02:02:53 - 02:02:57]
example is like OIC was uh supposed to

[02:02:55 - 02:02:59]
be for something else and now it's used

[02:02:57 - 02:03:01]
for weight loss is that kind of EXA

[02:02:59 - 02:03:03]
exactly you discovered that it can do

[02:03:01 - 02:03:05]
this um right so but was that the case

[02:03:03 - 02:03:06]
with bird they like did not expect to

[02:03:05 - 02:03:08]
you like or was it like they made the

[02:03:06 - 02:03:10]
Transformer architecture and then they

[02:03:08 - 02:03:11]
said okay we're going to just take off

[02:03:10 - 02:03:13]
the first half and see what we can do

[02:03:11 - 02:03:14]
with it and then they were're like oh I

[02:03:13 - 02:03:18]
guess I can do this

[02:03:14 - 02:03:21]
or uh um I think the first thing that I

[02:03:18 - 02:03:25]
have to go back through the the

[02:03:21 - 02:03:27]
literature sure um I think they were

[02:03:25 - 02:03:29]
just experimenting with different models

[02:03:27 - 02:03:32]
and things like that I don't know that

[02:03:29 - 02:03:34]
this is not the one for the

[02:03:32 - 02:03:38]
sequence uh sequence to sequence I have

[02:03:34 - 02:03:41]
to go back and see um well if if you

[02:03:38 - 02:03:42]
want I have a pause feature I can pause

[02:03:41 - 02:03:46]
if you want yeah let's let's pause that

[02:03:42 - 02:03:48]
let's pause let's pause and see I we're

[02:03:46 - 02:03:51]
back from uh from paus Land here and so

[02:03:48 - 02:03:53]
we did a bit more research in here and I

[02:03:51 - 02:03:54]
don't know if we remember exactly what

[02:03:53 - 02:03:57]
we asked because we had a really good

[02:03:54 - 02:04:00]
sidebar conversation but um I think we

[02:03:57 - 02:04:04]
were talking about um uh the discovery

[02:04:00 - 02:04:06]
of Bert and what came before it uh and

[02:04:04 - 02:04:08]
or or you know like did did GPT or Bert

[02:04:06 - 02:04:11]
come first I think that it was it GP

[02:04:08 - 02:04:13]
Bert came first or GPT came second so it

[02:04:11 - 02:04:14]
depends on different references we

[02:04:13 - 02:04:16]
looked at two different references and

[02:04:14 - 02:04:18]
so like we said the Transformer paper

[02:04:16 - 02:04:23]
which is the attention all you need

[02:04:18 - 02:04:26]
paper uh came out in 2017 and now was a

[02:04:23 - 02:04:28]
uh a work between uh Google but also the

[02:04:26 - 02:04:29]
University of Toronto I should say that

[02:04:28 - 02:04:32]
as a Canadian people forget that it's

[02:04:29 - 02:04:35]
University of Toronto it's a you know uh

[02:04:32 - 02:04:38]
and then um there in

[02:04:35 - 02:04:42]
2018 uh Bert came out as a an encoder

[02:04:38 - 02:04:45]
only model and the gpts came out also uh

[02:04:42 - 02:04:47]
as a decoder only model and based on my

[02:04:45 - 02:04:50]
reference on the book I'm reading it

[02:04:47 - 02:04:51]
said that bird came first but when we

[02:04:50 - 02:04:54]
looked in the internet there were

[02:04:51 - 02:04:56]
referen that said gpt1 came first so I I

[02:04:54 - 02:04:58]
would say they came at the first in the

[02:04:56 - 02:05:01]
same year

[02:04:58 - 02:05:04]
um the they they're the first two I

[02:05:01 - 02:05:06]
guess one of the first two that came out

[02:05:04 - 02:05:07]
well that kind of makes sense because

[02:05:06 - 02:05:08]
you know if they had this Transformer

[02:05:07 - 02:05:10]
architecture and then they split it in

[02:05:08 - 02:05:12]
half and played around with it I could

[02:05:10 - 02:05:13]
see them doing that I can't imagine that

[02:05:12 - 02:05:16]
they made them in Iceland and attached

[02:05:13 - 02:05:18]
them or maybe they did I'm not sure but

[02:05:16 - 02:05:21]
uh all we know is that all these things

[02:05:18 - 02:05:24]
happen close together um and uh we are

[02:05:21 - 02:05:25]
we are where we are now um but anyway

[02:05:24 - 02:05:27]
we'll continue on here so Bert can be

[02:05:25 - 02:05:30]
fine-tuned to perform uh the following

[02:05:27 - 02:05:31]
tasks now I only know Bert for one thing

[02:05:30 - 02:05:32]
and that's to use it for embeddings I

[02:05:31 - 02:05:34]
shouldn't say that because I did run

[02:05:32 - 02:05:35]
Bert a few times uh in this gen

[02:05:34 - 02:05:39]
Essentials course for different fine

[02:05:35 - 02:05:41]
tuning but I did not realize how broadly

[02:05:39 - 02:05:43]
it could be applied to things so we had

[02:05:41 - 02:05:44]
name entity recognition question and

[02:05:43 - 02:05:46]
answering sentence pair task

[02:05:44 - 02:05:48]
summarization feature extraction and

[02:05:46 - 02:05:49]
beddings uh and more I actually have

[02:05:48 - 02:05:54]
another example I can't remember what it

[02:05:49 - 02:05:55]
is but it's on the next slide um and so

[02:05:54 - 02:05:58]
there's all these things that you can do

[02:05:55 - 02:06:00]
for fine tuning what do you see folks

[02:05:58 - 02:06:03]
using Bert the most for uh in the

[02:06:00 - 02:06:06]
industry and or like today like what

[02:06:03 - 02:06:10]
would people gravitate towards uh Bert

[02:06:06 - 02:06:14]
to utilize for so I see it uh for I've

[02:06:10 - 02:06:16]
seen it work with the classification uh

[02:06:14 - 02:06:21]
so you give it a piece of text and then

[02:06:16 - 02:06:24]
you classify um that as um a particular

[02:06:21 - 02:06:25]
label you're interested in um and that

[02:06:24 - 02:06:27]
makes sense all of these things if you

[02:06:25 - 02:06:30]
think about what they are named entity

[02:06:27 - 02:06:32]
recognition uh I see sentiment analysis

[02:06:30 - 02:06:35]
as well we we some people use that which

[02:06:32 - 02:06:37]
is also a label in a sense um they're

[02:06:35 - 02:06:41]
they're all the same type of work so

[02:06:37 - 02:06:44]
incoder only models are really good at

[02:06:41 - 02:06:46]
um analyzing text to reach a conclusion

[02:06:44 - 02:06:48]
right to to do some sort of task to

[02:06:46 - 02:06:51]
reach a conclusion not for uh to

[02:06:48 - 02:06:54]
generate a sequence to sequence system

[02:06:51 - 02:06:56]
so yeah this is all in line um and I

[02:06:54 - 02:06:59]
think yeah the most I've seen is

[02:06:56 - 02:07:01]
classification um and sentiment

[02:06:59 - 02:07:03]
analysis okay so classification

[02:07:01 - 02:07:05]
sentiment analysis that's good because

[02:07:03 - 02:07:06]
those are the two main or sorry

[02:07:05 - 02:07:08]
embeddings and then the other two as you

[02:07:06 - 02:07:10]
mentioned were the ones that I were

[02:07:08 - 02:07:12]
utilizing it for um I'm surprised I can

[02:07:10 - 02:07:15]
do question and answering but uh I

[02:07:12 - 02:07:17]
always wonder if like the very early um

[02:07:15 - 02:07:19]
oh s yes I think even if it does

[02:07:17 - 02:07:22]
question answering it's fairly short

[02:07:19 - 02:07:24]
like the context out the output context

[02:07:22 - 02:07:26]
window would be fairly limited well this

[02:07:24 - 02:07:29]
wouldn't be something that people would

[02:07:26 - 02:07:32]
use as uh something for their um uh

[02:07:29 - 02:07:35]
website say as a as a customer service

[02:07:32 - 02:07:37]
uh body would be too incapable of it um

[02:07:35 - 02:07:40]
yeah I don't think that's what it's made

[02:07:37 - 02:07:42]
for it's not a um I think the context

[02:07:40 - 02:07:45]
would be fairly

[02:07:42 - 02:07:47]
short uh so there are multiple sizes of

[02:07:45 - 02:07:48]
birds we have 100 million parameters 240

[02:07:47 - 02:07:50]
million parameters four million

[02:07:48 - 02:07:55]
parameters and they said there was like

[02:07:50 - 02:07:58]
24 other varying models um I'm assuming

[02:07:55 - 02:08:00]
Bert base uncase is the most used model

[02:07:58 - 02:08:03]
I that's the one I keep seeing the most

[02:08:00 - 02:08:04]
I'm not as sure as to why but obviously

[02:08:03 - 02:08:06]
I would imagine that you're going to get

[02:08:04 - 02:08:09]
different levels of Performance Based on

[02:08:06 - 02:08:13]
the amount of uh parameters being used

[02:08:09 - 02:08:14]
is Bert tiny four uh four million is

[02:08:13 - 02:08:16]
there any use case for such a small

[02:08:14 - 02:08:20]
model

[02:08:16 - 02:08:22]
or um other than learning I well I think

[02:08:20 - 02:08:24]
if you can put it on Ed or something

[02:08:22 - 02:08:25]
like that potentially uh it depends

[02:08:24 - 02:08:28]
again what you want to do with it and

[02:08:25 - 02:08:30]
how well it does so you'd have to it's

[02:08:28 - 02:08:33]
really hard to know what a model will do

[02:08:30 - 02:08:35]
in any particular situation what we do

[02:08:33 - 02:08:39]
know though is

[02:08:35 - 02:08:40]
that okay sorry uh what we do know is

[02:08:39 - 02:08:42]
that so there's a really good paper that

[02:08:40 - 02:08:44]
came out called the chinchilla paper I

[02:08:42 - 02:08:47]
don't know if you've heard about that

[02:08:44 - 02:08:49]
one okay so the chinella paper looks at

[02:08:47 - 02:08:52]
optimizing

[02:08:49 - 02:08:55]
model the model sizes versus the data

[02:08:52 - 02:08:57]
versus the compute so it it looks at um

[02:08:55 - 02:08:59]
let me pull it actually let me pull it

[02:08:57 - 02:09:03]
in uh but some really cool things came

[02:08:59 - 02:09:03]
out of of that paper

[02:09:04 - 02:09:11]
um and the idea is that oh let me get

[02:09:08 - 02:09:11]
you the name of

[02:09:12 - 02:09:16]
that um and so it really looked at the

[02:09:14 - 02:09:18]
relationship between the model uh the

[02:09:16 - 02:09:20]
model size the data set size the

[02:09:18 - 02:09:21]
Computer Resources required and what it

[02:09:20 - 02:09:25]
came out with

[02:09:21 - 02:09:27]
is it realized that um obviously the

[02:09:25 - 02:09:30]
bigger the model the more information it

[02:09:27 - 02:09:32]
can understand the the better uh the

[02:09:30 - 02:09:35]
more things it can do uh but also the

[02:09:32 - 02:09:38]
bigger the model the more data it

[02:09:35 - 02:09:40]
needs right so um it came up with the

[02:09:38 - 02:09:43]
idea that many models seem to be

[02:09:40 - 02:09:46]
overparameterized and undertrained so um

[02:09:43 - 02:09:50]
can we do a lot with 340 million I think

[02:09:46 - 02:09:54]
we can uh it depends on what data it's

[02:09:50 - 02:09:58]
seen and what data you use to give it so

[02:09:54 - 02:10:00]
um yeah we you can if you find tun it

[02:09:58 - 02:10:01]
specifically on so sorry the one key

[02:10:00 - 02:10:04]
thing that

[02:10:01 - 02:10:06]
I the one thing I heard that sounded

[02:10:04 - 02:10:08]
very important was that uh there are

[02:10:06 - 02:10:11]
models that are over partied but

[02:10:08 - 02:10:15]
undertrained meaning that they have a

[02:10:11 - 02:10:18]
lot of um connections between their

[02:10:15 - 02:10:21]
nodes but the amount of passes I'm

[02:10:18 - 02:10:24]
assuming that's when we been training is

[02:10:21 - 02:10:27]
uh is as few or the data plus passes

[02:10:24 - 02:10:29]
going through is not enough yeah so

[02:10:27 - 02:10:31]
there's a lot of space in that model to

[02:10:29 - 02:10:34]
learn it's like having a big brain but

[02:10:31 - 02:10:38]
not actually filling it with with much

[02:10:34 - 02:10:40]
in a sense right like you so the idea of

[02:10:38 - 02:10:43]
um the size of the model we have to

[02:10:40 - 02:10:45]
understand so is is 340 million enough

[02:10:43 - 02:10:47]
well it depends on what data it's seen

[02:10:45 - 02:10:51]
right so these things tend to be very

[02:10:47 - 02:10:53]
difficult to judge like that um and so

[02:10:51 - 02:10:54]
it's It's a combination and and the more

[02:10:53 - 02:10:57]
and the bigger the model is then the

[02:10:54 - 02:10:59]
more data it should see for it to do a

[02:10:57 - 02:11:01]
decent job and so the chinchilla paper

[02:10:59 - 02:11:03]
came out with the conclusion that a lot

[02:11:01 - 02:11:06]
of models seem to be overparameterized

[02:11:03 - 02:11:10]
and under um and undertrained so they

[02:11:06 - 02:11:12]
they they would get used they would do

[02:11:10 - 02:11:14]
better if they see more data and just as

[02:11:12 - 02:11:17]
a side note I think they came up with

[02:11:14 - 02:11:19]
the number that the data set size and

[02:11:17 - 02:11:21]
tokens should be about 20 times the

[02:11:19 - 02:11:26]
number of parameters so if for

[02:11:21 - 02:11:28]
340 million parameter model you'd have

[02:11:26 - 02:11:29]
to multiply that by 20 to understand

[02:11:28 - 02:11:34]
what the size of the data set that's

[02:11:29 - 02:11:36]
ideal for that model okay so I guess my

[02:11:34 - 02:11:39]
other thought is that if you have a

[02:11:36 - 02:11:41]
model that has a lot of parameters but

[02:11:39 - 02:11:43]
you don't do many passes of training and

[02:11:41 - 02:11:46]
your data set's not that large is the

[02:11:43 - 02:11:49]
size of the model going to be smaller

[02:11:46 - 02:11:51]
because the training was less intense

[02:11:49 - 02:11:53]
and or the parameter size is going to

[02:11:51 - 02:11:56]
basically determine the size model the

[02:11:53 - 02:12:00]
the parameter model the parameter size

[02:11:56 - 02:12:02]
which is the which is in a sense just uh

[02:12:00 - 02:12:05]
a how many model how many parameters

[02:12:02 - 02:12:09]
this model has that's constant so even

[02:12:05 - 02:12:11]
before it um before a model is trained

[02:12:09 - 02:12:13]
at all it still has the exact same

[02:12:11 - 02:12:15]
parameter models and what ends up

[02:12:13 - 02:12:19]
happening in

[02:12:15 - 02:12:21]
um the in in the training world is those

[02:12:19 - 02:12:23]
fit let's say 340 million parameters

[02:12:21 - 02:12:26]
they're initialized to random

[02:12:23 - 02:12:29]
weights they're initialized randomly and

[02:12:26 - 02:12:31]
then as it sees the data what it does is

[02:12:29 - 02:12:36]
it um it makes a

[02:12:31 - 02:12:38]
prediction and then it goes back uh it

[02:12:36 - 02:12:40]
we say it it optimizes objective

[02:12:38 - 02:12:42]
function so it estimates how how off it

[02:12:40 - 02:12:44]
is and then it adjusts those parameters

[02:12:42 - 02:12:46]
accordingly and then it Loops over and

[02:12:44 - 02:12:49]
over it it makes a prediction calculates

[02:12:46 - 02:12:51]
it its errors readjusts and then it does

[02:12:49 - 02:12:54]
that over and over and over until it

[02:12:51 - 02:12:57]
minimizes its error

[02:12:54 - 02:12:59]
margin and so in the beginning of the

[02:12:57 - 02:13:01]
training you still have you have 340

[02:12:59 - 02:13:03]
million parameters that are just random

[02:13:01 - 02:13:05]
and at the end of it you have 340

[02:13:03 - 02:13:07]
million parameters that have some sort

[02:13:05 - 02:13:08]
of representation of the real world of

[02:13:07 - 02:13:13]
what it trained not of the real world

[02:13:08 - 02:13:17]
but of what it trained on um and

[02:13:13 - 02:13:19]
so the the data comes in in that how

[02:13:17 - 02:13:23]
good are these parameters tuned like

[02:13:19 - 02:13:27]
how good good are these parameters to

[02:13:23 - 02:13:29]
allow you to to complete a task well if

[02:13:27 - 02:13:31]
that makes sense I actually uh I I I

[02:13:29 - 02:13:33]
could show maybe I should share this

[02:13:31 - 02:13:36]
with you I did um a little bit of a

[02:13:33 - 02:13:38]
representation on a linear uh and a

[02:13:36 - 02:13:41]
logistic on a linear regression about

[02:13:38 - 02:13:43]
how it starts and how it adjusts you

[02:13:41 - 02:13:44]
could see it on a notebook I'll share

[02:13:43 - 02:13:48]
that with you it's it's really nice how

[02:13:44 - 02:13:51]
to while you see it train and adjust it

[02:13:48 - 02:13:53]
that sounds really cool um I what one

[02:13:51 - 02:13:55]
thing I was trying to try to figure out

[02:13:53 - 02:13:58]
was that um or for for folks that might

[02:13:55 - 02:14:01]
think is like is a larger model in file

[02:13:58 - 02:14:03]
size mean that it's more trained or more

[02:14:01 - 02:14:05]
intelligent but what I'm hearing is that

[02:14:03 - 02:14:06]
the size of the model is based on the

[02:14:05 - 02:14:09]
amount of parameters because that's the

[02:14:06 - 02:14:11]
amount of data it's being held within

[02:14:09 - 02:14:12]
the model weights and so all you're

[02:14:11 - 02:14:13]
doing is adjusting those weights so

[02:14:12 - 02:14:16]
you're not going to they're just numbers

[02:14:13 - 02:14:18]
right so it's not going to be bigger or

[02:14:16 - 02:14:20]
smaller I mean there might obviously be

[02:14:18 - 02:14:23]
some flux to some degree but it's not

[02:14:20 - 02:14:24]
going to be you know if you did you know

[02:14:23 - 02:14:26]
10 times more train it's going to be 10

[02:14:24 - 02:14:27]
times larger it's really the parameter

[02:14:26 - 02:14:31]
size that's going to determine its end

[02:14:27 - 02:14:32]
size exactly so regardless of what where

[02:14:31 - 02:14:34]
the model is whether it's good or bad

[02:14:32 - 02:14:36]
it'll have the same size it is a

[02:14:34 - 02:14:39]
constant size um but what what really

[02:14:36 - 02:14:42]
matters is how well what those numbers

[02:14:39 - 02:14:44]
are these 340 parameters what are they

[02:14:42 - 02:14:47]
and are they because they you have to

[02:14:44 - 02:14:50]
think about it is they they they in

[02:14:47 - 02:14:52]
that's a mathematical model right and so

[02:14:50 - 02:14:54]
that's what matters the file size though

[02:14:52 - 02:14:56]
some people tell me oh the file size

[02:14:54 - 02:14:57]
increases the file size should not

[02:14:56 - 02:15:00]
increase the reason the file size

[02:14:57 - 02:15:03]
increases is because certain programs

[02:15:00 - 02:15:06]
attach metadata to the system and so

[02:15:03 - 02:15:09]
when you when you train the the

[02:15:06 - 02:15:12]
optimizer sometimes or or um attaches

[02:15:09 - 02:15:15]
metadata of of training States that's

[02:15:12 - 02:15:17]
what makes a bigger file the model

[02:15:15 - 02:15:21]
itself should always be constant at

[02:15:17 - 02:15:24]
whatever level you set it at

[02:15:21 - 02:15:26]
okay that makes sense so so it there are

[02:15:24 - 02:15:27]
cases where the data gets larger but

[02:15:26 - 02:15:29]
it's not for the reasons that you think

[02:15:27 - 02:15:31]
it's because you know as you're saying

[02:15:29 - 02:15:33]
there's additional data being attached

[02:15:31 - 02:15:36]
um as metadata and that makes total

[02:15:33 - 02:15:37]
sense there um just continue on here

[02:15:36 - 02:15:39]
with Bert yeah there's obviously a bunch

[02:15:37 - 02:15:41]
of variants I didn't look at any of the

[02:15:39 - 02:15:42]
variants I just assume like I know I

[02:15:41 - 02:15:45]
always see the word distill so I assume

[02:15:42 - 02:15:47]
that that's just a more optimized

[02:15:45 - 02:15:48]
optimized model like I don't know if

[02:15:47 - 02:15:51]
it's a pruned model or whatever you call

[02:15:48 - 02:15:52]
it but I just know that um they're

[02:15:51 - 02:15:54]
generally more performant like two three

[02:15:52 - 02:15:56]
times and they're cutting Corners to to

[02:15:54 - 02:15:57]
do that not in a bad way I mean like

[02:15:56 - 02:15:59]
they're they're figuring a way to make

[02:15:57 - 02:16:01]
it more

[02:15:59 - 02:16:03]
performant um I haven't looked at all

[02:16:01 - 02:16:06]
these either um but you have to think

[02:16:03 - 02:16:08]
about of these as so I think Roberta let

[02:16:06 - 02:16:11]
me uh they all came out later like

[02:16:08 - 02:16:13]
Roberta came out in 2019 so a year later

[02:16:11 - 02:16:15]
you have to think of this as a natural

[02:16:13 - 02:16:18]
like you know how man evolved um you

[02:16:15 - 02:16:19]
know the evolution of man where we and

[02:16:18 - 02:16:22]
then and you have to think of it like

[02:16:19 - 02:16:24]
that right every year there's new models

[02:16:22 - 02:16:26]
um based on new understanding based on

[02:16:24 - 02:16:28]
New Concepts based on better

[02:16:26 - 02:16:31]
optimizations and so um this is the

[02:16:28 - 02:16:35]
Natural Evolution of

[02:16:31 - 02:16:36]
it yeah so so yeah I understand that I

[02:16:35 - 02:16:38]
guess I guess I was just really getting

[02:16:36 - 02:16:40]
hung up on the word distill because I

[02:16:38 - 02:16:42]
keep seeing it and every time I come ac

[02:16:40 - 02:16:45]
across a distilled model uh they always

[02:16:42 - 02:16:48]
describe it as like two three four times

[02:16:45 - 02:16:50]
faster and they've done something to it

[02:16:48 - 02:16:52]
whereas to um again I'm not sure it's

[02:16:50 - 02:16:54]
pruning or they're doing some kind of

[02:16:52 - 02:16:56]
optimization to the model to make it

[02:16:54 - 02:16:58]
more proficient like for instance

[02:16:56 - 02:17:00]
whisper has distilled whisper and I just

[02:16:58 - 02:17:02]
keep seeing the term whis uh distill so

[02:17:00 - 02:17:04]
I guess my real question is like when

[02:17:02 - 02:17:05]
you see these terms like distill does

[02:17:04 - 02:17:07]
that do you know what that means or it's

[02:17:05 - 02:17:09]
just that it is they're just putting

[02:17:07 - 02:17:11]
that name there and it's suggesting that

[02:17:09 - 02:17:13]
like is there a rhyme and reason to the

[02:17:11 - 02:17:14]
naming across models or there's no

[02:17:13 - 02:17:15]
convention and people can attach

[02:17:14 - 02:17:18]
whatever they want like sometimes I see

[02:17:15 - 02:17:20]
models that have Omni in front of it and

[02:17:18 - 02:17:21]
are they just putting Omni in front of

[02:17:20 - 02:17:25]
everything when they that they think

[02:17:21 - 02:17:27]
Omni sounds cool or yeah I think um

[02:17:25 - 02:17:29]
these are researchers in Labs right or

[02:17:27 - 02:17:32]
people in different companies and

[02:17:29 - 02:17:33]
there's no real naming convention uh and

[02:17:32 - 02:17:36]
so they can

[02:17:33 - 02:17:38]
realistically name things the way they

[02:17:36 - 02:17:40]
want we just talked about how really

[02:17:38 - 02:17:42]
bidirectional is somewhat a misnomer

[02:17:40 - 02:17:46]
should be non-directional but these you

[02:17:42 - 02:17:49]
know the the namings I don't I don't

[02:17:46 - 02:17:51]
attach too much to it um and they also

[02:17:49 - 02:17:53]
want it to be really cool when when you

[02:17:51 - 02:17:56]
make an acronym out of it so sometimes

[02:17:53 - 02:17:59]
it is a misam for the acronym um but a

[02:17:56 - 02:18:03]
distilled model so there's a lot of

[02:17:59 - 02:18:05]
ways that you can um optimize a model uh

[02:18:03 - 02:18:10]
like you said some of it is pruning some

[02:18:05 - 02:18:13]
of it is um these uh teacher uh teacher

[02:18:10 - 02:18:15]
models uh AWS actually I reinvent they

[02:18:13 - 02:18:18]
now now

[02:18:15 - 02:18:21]
um Bedrock you can create these um

[02:18:18 - 02:18:25]
smaller student models and what that

[02:18:21 - 02:18:27]
allows you to do um is to take this

[02:18:25 - 02:18:29]
really big model and create a smaller

[02:18:27 - 02:18:31]
model that is very optimized for your

[02:18:29 - 02:18:33]
task um and so the idea is

[02:18:31 - 02:18:36]
to

[02:18:33 - 02:18:40]
um instead of and we talked about this

[02:18:36 - 02:18:43]
in in in the previous um system we ran

[02:18:40 - 02:18:46]
but maybe we we can mention some of this

[02:18:43 - 02:18:49]
uh these models can be really really big

[02:18:46 - 02:18:56]
right they're they're fairly

[02:18:49 - 02:18:59]
huge um and so what um the the and and a

[02:18:56 - 02:19:02]
huge model means more latency it means

[02:18:59 - 02:19:06]
more resources it means more cost and so

[02:19:02 - 02:19:08]
this idea of creating smaller models uh

[02:19:06 - 02:19:10]
distal models in in various ways you

[02:19:08 - 02:19:14]
could do this in in many ways you can

[02:19:10 - 02:19:18]
you can prune you can uh teach uh a

[02:19:14 - 02:19:21]
student model you can um you know do

[02:19:18 - 02:19:23]
different things uh the idea is to

[02:19:21 - 02:19:25]
reduce cost and latency and resources uh

[02:19:23 - 02:19:28]
by doing that and there's various ways

[02:19:25 - 02:19:29]
we can do that we can potentially I can

[02:19:28 - 02:19:31]
potentially put um some resarch for you

[02:19:29 - 02:19:34]
as to like the different ways that is

[02:19:31 - 02:19:38]
done so I I think what I'm seeing here

[02:19:34 - 02:19:41]
is that dist uh distillation uh distill

[02:19:38 - 02:19:42]
could suggest that it's this teacher

[02:19:41 - 02:19:44]
knowledge transfer thing where you have

[02:19:42 - 02:19:47]
a more intelligent model transferring to

[02:19:44 - 02:19:49]
a more cost effective model but also to

[02:19:47 - 02:19:51]
warn that uh naming conventions are not

[02:19:49 - 02:19:53]
not necessarily said Stone so someone

[02:19:51 - 02:19:56]
could put distill in front of it and the

[02:19:53 - 02:19:58]
means could could could be different um

[02:19:56 - 02:20:00]
and that's just a general a general a

[02:19:58 - 02:20:03]
general um I think a general warning

[02:20:00 - 02:20:04]
that we might suggest is that um you

[02:20:03 - 02:20:06]
everything you have to look at you have

[02:20:04 - 02:20:09]
to look at see what it does um

[02:20:06 - 02:20:11]
regardless of its of its uh name

[02:20:09 - 02:20:13]
tag model name I think naming

[02:20:11 - 02:20:17]
conventions are not there yet in terms

[02:20:13 - 02:20:18]
of consistency across different teams

[02:20:17 - 02:20:20]
yeah like I might I I might I might

[02:20:18 - 02:20:21]
create a model and then I decide that

[02:20:20 - 02:20:24]
it's just distillation but I actually

[02:20:21 - 02:20:26]
don't know what distillation means and I

[02:20:24 - 02:20:27]
came from a chemistry yeah I came from a

[02:20:26 - 02:20:29]
chemistry background I think the the

[02:20:27 - 02:20:32]
world distillation means to to take the

[02:20:29 - 02:20:35]
essence of right to

[02:20:32 - 02:20:37]
to you know when you distill a chemical

[02:20:35 - 02:20:39]
you're really um taking all of the

[02:20:37 - 02:20:42]
impurities and and getting the the

[02:20:39 - 02:20:44]
essence of that chemical um see I would

[02:20:42 - 02:20:45]
I I would just make a model smaller

[02:20:44 - 02:20:46]
somehow and then I would put distill in

[02:20:45 - 02:20:47]
front of it and everyone would be like

[02:20:46 - 02:20:49]
what are you doing

[02:20:47 - 02:20:51]
Andrew but I'd be like I don't know I

[02:20:49 - 02:20:54]
thought that's what it was

[02:20:51 - 02:20:56]
um uh yeah so then I put this while bird

[02:20:54 - 02:20:58]
is an older model still used for Ubi

[02:20:56 - 02:21:01]
Baseline in natural language processing

[02:20:58 - 02:21:04]
that's specifically what um uh Wikipedia

[02:21:01 - 02:21:05]
said so they were saying that I is I

[02:21:04 - 02:21:07]
guess a comparative for when you're

[02:21:05 - 02:21:09]
doing NLP experiments to use it as a

[02:21:07 - 02:21:11]
baseline I don't know what they mean by

[02:21:09 - 02:21:13]
that I just know that they say that so

[02:21:11 - 02:21:16]
I'm not sure how you use it as a

[02:21:13 - 02:21:18]
baseline but that's what they say I'm

[02:21:16 - 02:21:21]
not sure I think the biggest thing in my

[02:21:18 - 02:21:23]
mind like we said is that uh it is an

[02:21:21 - 02:21:26]
encoder model only so it's great for

[02:21:23 - 02:21:28]
when you have text that you want to do a

[02:21:26 - 02:21:31]
very specific um task on you want to

[02:21:28 - 02:21:33]
reach a particular conclusion um and

[02:21:31 - 02:21:34]
that's where these encoder only models

[02:21:33 - 02:21:37]
come

[02:21:34 - 02:21:39]
in uh and so here I have an example of

[02:21:37 - 02:21:41]
Bert using sentiment analysis so here

[02:21:39 - 02:21:45]
we're using the hugging face pipeline uh

[02:21:41 - 02:21:47]
we're using the Bert Bas uncased uh and

[02:21:45 - 02:21:51]
then we have a couple sentences we uh

[02:21:47 - 02:21:53]
and then uh it I guess what it does here

[02:21:51 - 02:21:54]
is it downloads the classifier model I'm

[02:21:53 - 02:21:56]
not sure how you like to work with

[02:21:54 - 02:21:59]
models and um I'm not sure if hugging

[02:21:56 - 02:22:01]
face is too high abstract for uh uh for

[02:21:59 - 02:22:02]
what you want to do a dayto day but as

[02:22:01 - 02:22:04]
far as I understand what's happening

[02:22:02 - 02:22:06]
here is that when you use the hugging

[02:22:04 - 02:22:08]
face Pipeline and you say sentiment

[02:22:06 - 02:22:11]
analysis even though we're specifying

[02:22:08 - 02:22:15]
The Bert based uncase model it's going

[02:22:11 - 02:22:17]
to download a version of The Bert based

[02:22:15 - 02:22:18]
uncase model that is fine-tuned for

[02:22:17 - 02:22:21]
sentiment analysis I think that's what's

[02:22:18 - 02:22:24]
happening here um as that's what the

[02:22:21 - 02:22:28]
documentation kind of suggests um but

[02:22:24 - 02:22:31]
yeah this is an example here of Bert and

[02:22:28 - 02:22:32]
I don't know that's that's all I got um

[02:22:31 - 02:22:34]
but I'm not sure if you have any

[02:22:32 - 02:22:36]
thoughts on on the code or if there's

[02:22:34 - 02:22:41]
anything to to talk around the code for

[02:22:36 - 02:22:43]
for pre-training models um or to further

[02:22:41 - 02:22:47]
further train models sorry well I mean I

[02:22:43 - 02:22:50]
think going back to the reinvent uh

[02:22:47 - 02:22:54]
keynote from uh uh

[02:22:50 - 02:22:56]
Verner um the idea of simplexity like

[02:22:54 - 02:22:57]
everybody want the simplexity remember

[02:22:56 - 02:23:00]
that that was a really good talk and

[02:22:57 - 02:23:02]
this idea of abstracting for you so I

[02:23:00 - 02:23:04]
think there's a lot of all of these like

[02:23:02 - 02:23:06]
the the fact that you can do this with a

[02:23:04 - 02:23:07]
huge model with a few lines of code is

[02:23:06 - 02:23:09]
really impressive but that what also

[02:23:07 - 02:23:11]
that what that also means is that

[02:23:09 - 02:23:13]
there's a whole lot of complexity under

[02:23:11 - 02:23:18]
the hood and the way you need to deal

[02:23:13 - 02:23:22]
with these is to actually understand how

[02:23:18 - 02:23:25]
the system works how the API the all of

[02:23:22 - 02:23:28]
these libraries work what this provider

[02:23:25 - 02:23:30]
um deals with and so I the way I like to

[02:23:28 - 02:23:32]
work is to stick to a single provider or

[02:23:30 - 02:23:35]
or at least like a few providers so that

[02:23:32 - 02:23:36]
you can understand kind of their way of

[02:23:35 - 02:23:39]
working and and how to look at their

[02:23:36 - 02:23:43]
documentation and and and do all of that

[02:23:39 - 02:23:45]
why because again there is a huge amount

[02:23:43 - 02:23:47]
of complexity that is kind of removed

[02:23:45 - 02:23:50]
and abstracted for you and you can just

[02:23:47 - 02:23:54]
call a few lines of code and while

[02:23:50 - 02:23:55]
that's sounds great um you to really

[02:23:54 - 02:23:57]
understand what is going on you really

[02:23:55 - 02:23:59]
have to peel the the the lid off a

[02:23:57 - 02:24:03]
little bit and understand and so if you

[02:23:59 - 02:24:05]
kind of get used to um particular

[02:24:03 - 02:24:07]
providers then you can understand how

[02:24:05 - 02:24:10]
their documentation work where where to

[02:24:07 - 02:24:13]
find particular information uh where to

[02:24:10 - 02:24:16]
read particular things um if that makes

[02:24:13 - 02:24:18]
sense so so that word simplexity it it

[02:24:16 - 02:24:21]
sounds like it almost sounds like

[02:24:18 - 02:24:23]
they're the opposite but um but the idea

[02:24:21 - 02:24:25]
is like you have a complex system but

[02:24:23 - 02:24:27]
they simplify it for you and so you you

[02:24:25 - 02:24:29]
under you understand these complex tools

[02:24:27 - 02:24:31]
through through this simple simple

[02:24:29 - 02:24:32]
interface so you are doing complex

[02:24:31 - 02:24:34]
things but things are abstracted away

[02:24:32 - 02:24:36]
from you exactly like look at that is

[02:24:34 - 02:24:38]
that enough like the amount of things

[02:24:36 - 02:24:41]
that happen like for it to understand

[02:24:38 - 02:24:43]
that sentence there's a process of

[02:24:41 - 02:24:45]
tokenization it's It's cutting these

[02:24:43 - 02:24:48]
into tokens and then it's embedding them

[02:24:45 - 02:24:51]
and then it is um you know running them

[02:24:48 - 02:24:53]
through a mathematical system and then

[02:24:51 - 02:24:55]
it's and then it's bringing them back to

[02:24:53 - 02:24:57]
to a label so there's a whole lot

[02:24:55 - 02:25:00]
happening and you write two lines of

[02:24:57 - 02:25:02]
code right it's Prett but as the person

[02:25:00 - 02:25:05]
that's using it I should generally

[02:25:02 - 02:25:07]
understand what's actually happening um

[02:25:05 - 02:25:08]
like the love like the complexity and

[02:25:07 - 02:25:12]
appreciate how much is being um

[02:25:08 - 02:25:14]
abstracted away for me um or or the fact

[02:25:12 - 02:25:15]
that there are cases where yes this is

[02:25:14 - 02:25:19]
good in this use case but you might have

[02:25:15 - 02:25:20]
to go and do this more at a lower level

[02:25:19 - 02:25:22]
like the same thing with high High Lev

[02:25:20 - 02:25:24]
abstract languages and lower level

[02:25:22 - 02:25:27]
abstract languages is that um come's

[02:25:24 - 02:25:30]
flexibility or come come more complexity

[02:25:27 - 02:25:32]
will get more flexibility

[02:25:30 - 02:25:36]
um yeah

[02:25:32 - 02:25:38]
yeah but um yeah that's Bert and uh I

[02:25:36 - 02:25:40]
don't know do you think uh they named it

[02:25:38 - 02:25:42]
Bert because of Sesame Street

[02:25:40 - 02:25:45]
character like somebody had a kid

[02:25:42 - 02:25:47]
somebody had a kid and they're like was

[02:25:45 - 02:25:49]
Bert and they're like let's just make it

[02:25:47 - 02:25:51]
let's figure out a way to name it Bert

[02:25:49 - 02:25:53]
it it's very possible I you know I

[02:25:51 - 02:25:55]
worked in labs for a long time and a lot

[02:25:53 - 02:25:58]
of times we did reverse engineer the

[02:25:55 - 02:26:00]
name to be the acronym so yeah very

[02:25:58 - 02:26:03]
possible so so so you're part of the

[02:26:00 - 02:26:04]
problem is what you're

[02:26:03 - 02:26:07]
tell I

[02:26:04 - 02:26:09]
mean marketing you have to it has to be

[02:26:07 - 02:26:10]
easy it has to roll off the tongue it

[02:26:09 - 02:26:13]
has

[02:26:10 - 02:26:16]
to well I I appreciate your uh your

[02:26:13 - 02:26:17]
expert input on Bert here I definitely

[02:26:16 - 02:26:19]
understand it a lot better I I hope that

[02:26:17 - 02:26:22]
people that are watching when they hear

[02:26:19 - 02:26:23]
me talk they don't realize how much

[02:26:22 - 02:26:25]
information that is missing from what

[02:26:23 - 02:26:27]
I'm saying and I'm just trying to give

[02:26:25 - 02:26:28]
them the most practical route the best

[02:26:27 - 02:26:32]
way understand it kind of like Chef

[02:26:28 - 02:26:34]
Ramsey where uh um sometimes he'll have

[02:26:32 - 02:26:36]
videos and he'll talk about the process

[02:26:34 - 02:26:38]
of something it's totally wrong but the

[02:26:36 - 02:26:41]
outcome of what he does is correct and

[02:26:38 - 02:26:42]
so uh that's what we call a practitioner

[02:26:41 - 02:26:43]
someone that's good at doing someone but

[02:26:42 - 02:26:46]
doesn't necessarily

[02:26:43 - 02:26:49]
know exactly how they're doing it and

[02:26:46 - 02:26:50]
gives inaccurate uh explanations and so

[02:26:49 - 02:26:52]
folks just need to understand that as

[02:26:50 - 02:26:53]
I'm making content here and that's why I

[02:26:52 - 02:26:55]
have you here to expose the lack of

[02:26:53 - 02:26:59]
knowledge I have um so I appreciate your

[02:26:55 - 02:27:01]
time and we will see Rola in more videos

[02:26:59 - 02:27:04]
and we're going to continue on with the

[02:27:01 - 02:27:07]
course

[02:27:04 - 02:27:09]
[Music]

[02:27:07 - 02:27:12]
chowchow let's take a look at sentence

[02:27:09 - 02:27:14]
Transformers also known as sbert I

[02:27:12 - 02:27:17]
imagine it stands for sentences Bert is

[02:27:14 - 02:27:19]
built on top of Bert it creates a single

[02:27:17 - 02:27:21]
Vector for an entire sentence and when

[02:27:19 - 02:27:24]
comparing similar sentences this is much

[02:27:21 - 02:27:27]
more performant than simply using Birch

[02:27:24 - 02:27:28]
which will look at every single word

[02:27:27 - 02:27:31]
these things are turning things into

[02:27:28 - 02:27:33]
vectors and so if every single word has

[02:27:31 - 02:27:34]
to be a vector that's going to add up

[02:27:33 - 02:27:37]
very quickly and so sentence

[02:27:34 - 02:27:39]
Transformers solves the limitations of

[02:27:37 - 02:27:41]
Bert specifically when you are dealing

[02:27:39 - 02:27:43]
with full sentences when you care about

[02:27:41 - 02:27:46]
comparing sentences if you are working

[02:27:43 - 02:27:48]
with a workload that is on a token per

[02:27:46 - 02:27:50]
token basis that maybe Bert is better so

[02:27:48 - 02:27:52]
it's not that uh sentence Transformers

[02:27:50 - 02:27:53]
is better it's just based on your use

[02:27:52 - 02:27:56]
case but here's an example of us using

[02:27:53 - 02:27:58]
sentence Transformers and um so here

[02:27:56 - 02:28:00]
we're just importing sentence

[02:27:58 - 02:28:03]
Transformers and uh I'm trying to get my

[02:28:00 - 02:28:05]
pen tool out here but what you'll see

[02:28:03 - 02:28:09]
here is that we are pulling in uh a a

[02:28:05 - 02:28:12]
very specific pre-trained model and um

[02:28:09 - 02:28:14]
I'm not exactly sure what all mini LM L6

[02:28:12 - 02:28:16]
version 2 does if we went onto hugging

[02:28:14 - 02:28:19]
face we could read about it or the

[02:28:16 - 02:28:21]
documentation on um esper.net but the

[02:28:19 - 02:28:22]
idea is that we have these two sentences

[02:28:21 - 02:28:25]
we're going to encode them into

[02:28:22 - 02:28:27]
embeddings and then we will be able to

[02:28:25 - 02:28:29]
compare them so sentence Transformers is

[02:28:27 - 02:28:30]
a really useful library because it

[02:28:29 - 02:28:32]
allows us to do embedding semantic

[02:28:30 - 02:28:36]
search retrieve and rerank clustering

[02:28:32 - 02:28:38]
image search uh and more um sometimes

[02:28:36 - 02:28:40]
you'll come across models and they

[02:28:38 - 02:28:43]
expect you to use sence Transformers for

[02:28:40 - 02:28:45]
the embeddings so it's good to know uh

[02:28:43 - 02:28:48]
when a model is actually using sentence

[02:28:45 - 02:28:51]
Transformers or not okay but there you

[02:28:48 - 02:28:51]
go

[02:28:51 - 02:28:54]
[Music]

[02:28:53 - 02:28:57]
hey this is Andrew Brown I want to get

[02:28:54 - 02:28:59]
you some handson uh uh skills or

[02:28:57 - 02:29:00]
knowledge with sentence transformers

[02:28:59 - 02:29:02]
this is something that just kept coming

[02:29:00 - 02:29:04]
up as I was learning about embeddings

[02:29:02 - 02:29:06]
and so I figured we should learn the

[02:29:04 - 02:29:08]
basics of it I'm not the best describe

[02:29:06 - 02:29:09]
all of its use cases for sentence

[02:29:08 - 02:29:11]
Transformers maybe I'll bring in an

[02:29:09 - 02:29:14]
expert here that can help us understand

[02:29:11 - 02:29:16]
a bit better but um I do think that

[02:29:14 - 02:29:17]
there it is worth our time to go try to

[02:29:16 - 02:29:19]
make sure that we know how to utilize

[02:29:17 - 02:29:21]
this and run it so let's go ahead here

[02:29:19 - 02:29:22]
and explore so I'm going to need some

[02:29:21 - 02:29:23]
kind of environment to run this in and I

[02:29:22 - 02:29:26]
don't think I need anything too

[02:29:23 - 02:29:28]
complicated for this um so I'm just

[02:29:26 - 02:29:31]
trying to think about where we could run

[02:29:28 - 02:29:32]
this um maybe Google collab might be

[02:29:31 - 02:29:33]
something that we could use so we'll go

[02:29:32 - 02:29:35]
ahead and type in Google

[02:29:33 - 02:29:37]
collab there's a lot of places where we

[02:29:35 - 02:29:40]
can use notebooks and today I'm going to

[02:29:37 - 02:29:41]
go ahead and use uh this one here so I'm

[02:29:40 - 02:29:44]
going to go ahead and just sign in so

[02:29:41 - 02:29:46]
just give me a moment to sign into my

[02:29:44 - 02:29:49]
account just a moment

[02:29:46 - 02:29:50]
here all right so now I've logged in and

[02:29:49 - 02:29:52]
let's go ahead and create ourselves a

[02:29:50 - 02:29:54]
new notebook so in the left hand corner

[02:29:52 - 02:29:56]
I'm going to go ahead and create a new

[02:29:54 - 02:29:57]
notebook and we'll just give that a

[02:29:56 - 02:29:59]
moment now if you have to create an

[02:29:57 - 02:30:01]
account um I've already created one so I

[02:29:59 - 02:30:02]
honestly don't remember the setup for

[02:30:01 - 02:30:04]
this but I'm sure you'll be able to

[02:30:02 - 02:30:06]
figure it out um and so here on the left

[02:30:04 - 02:30:08]
hand side we have our our coding space

[02:30:06 - 02:30:09]
and let's go ahead and see if we can get

[02:30:08 - 02:30:12]
this to work before we do let's just

[02:30:09 - 02:30:15]
rename this to like sentence

[02:30:12 - 02:30:16]
Transformers uh basic okay and then I'm

[02:30:15 - 02:30:18]
going to go back over to here and let's

[02:30:16 - 02:30:20]
give this a go so the first thing we'll

[02:30:18 - 02:30:22]
need is the sentence Transformers so go

[02:30:20 - 02:30:24]
ahead and import that now the thing is

[02:30:22 - 02:30:26]
is that um I don't know what this

[02:30:24 - 02:30:27]
environment already has in it so it

[02:30:26 - 02:30:29]
might already have some things

[02:30:27 - 02:30:31]
pre-installed and one way that we could

[02:30:29 - 02:30:32]
check cuz we're trying to import stuff

[02:30:31 - 02:30:35]
here I'm just trying to think here

[02:30:32 - 02:30:39]
there's a way for us to list um things

[02:30:35 - 02:30:41]
I'm wonder if I go like uh pip uh maybe

[02:30:39 - 02:30:43]
it's PIP show or pip list let's see if

[02:30:41 - 02:30:43]
that

[02:30:44 - 02:30:50]
works I don't recall what the command is

[02:30:46 - 02:30:54]
but we'll just say like show all um

[02:30:50 - 02:30:56]
uh python libraries

[02:30:54 - 02:30:57]
installed there's definitely a uh PIP

[02:30:56 - 02:30:59]
show

[02:30:57 - 02:31:01]
command it is PIP list okay so we'll go

[02:30:59 - 02:31:03]
back over to here and so right away

[02:31:01 - 02:31:04]
we're getting a large list and so one

[02:31:03 - 02:31:06]
thing I'm wondering is like what do we

[02:31:04 - 02:31:08]
have if we go over to here do we have

[02:31:06 - 02:31:10]
sentence Transformers so I'm going to go

[02:31:08 - 02:31:14]
and search for it and so I don't see it

[02:31:10 - 02:31:16]
in our list um we could also do this say

[02:31:14 - 02:31:17]
uh uh this and see if we can get that

[02:31:16 - 02:31:19]
exact

[02:31:17 - 02:31:20]
version but this might not be

[02:31:19 - 02:31:22]
pre-installed and that's totally fine if

[02:31:20 - 02:31:24]
it's not but it is and so we have

[02:31:22 - 02:31:26]
version 3.21 so that is interesting

[02:31:24 - 02:31:28]
there I'm going to go ahead and just

[02:31:26 - 02:31:29]
continue on um I don't know what the

[02:31:28 - 02:31:31]
latest version is but sometimes you

[02:31:29 - 02:31:32]
might want to check this I'm going to go

[02:31:31 - 02:31:34]
and type in sentence Transformers I'm

[02:31:32 - 02:31:38]
going to assume this is on GitHub which

[02:31:34 - 02:31:40]
is over here by you UK laabs If we drop

[02:31:38 - 02:31:44]
down here we can see tags and we have

[02:31:40 - 02:31:46]
3.31 as the latest version this one's on

[02:31:44 - 02:31:47]
3.21 sometimes you might want to check

[02:31:46 - 02:31:50]
what the difference is I'll go over to

[02:31:47 - 02:31:54]
releases here okay

[02:31:50 - 02:31:56]
and so we have some uh

[02:31:54 - 02:31:59]
changes massive CPU changes speed up

[02:31:56 - 02:32:01]
with open V that's really good um so

[02:31:59 - 02:32:03]
yeah you know the question is should we

[02:32:01 - 02:32:05]
use the latest one I don't know uh it

[02:32:03 - 02:32:07]
really depends if this stuff will work

[02:32:05 - 02:32:08]
on the current version uh but I'm going

[02:32:07 - 02:32:10]
to just give it a go but notice here it

[02:32:08 - 02:32:12]
says load a pre-train s Transformers

[02:32:10 - 02:32:14]
model so it looks like it's bringing

[02:32:12 - 02:32:16]
that model in from somewhere since this

[02:32:14 - 02:32:18]
is maintained by hugging face I'm going

[02:32:16 - 02:32:19]
to assume that this is something that is

[02:32:18 - 02:32:22]
available here on hugging face let's go

[02:32:19 - 02:32:25]
ahead type that in and so it's all the

[02:32:22 - 02:32:27]
way over here so here we have this is a

[02:32:25 - 02:32:29]
sentence Transformer model that map

[02:32:27 - 02:32:30]
sentences and paragraphs to a 384

[02:32:29 - 02:32:31]
dimensional dense Vector space and can

[02:32:30 - 02:32:34]
be used for tasks like clustering

[02:32:31 - 02:32:36]
semantic search so it seems like you

[02:32:34 - 02:32:38]
know sence Transformers has a bunch of

[02:32:36 - 02:32:41]
models that it can load or variance on

[02:32:38 - 02:32:44]
its original model um but if we go over

[02:32:41 - 02:32:44]
to here I'm just curious can we see

[02:32:45 - 02:32:50]
more yeah we have embedding models

[02:32:47 - 02:32:51]
parallel ascendance data sets so so yeah

[02:32:50 - 02:32:54]
looks like there is a bunch of um

[02:32:51 - 02:32:56]
variants under here of embedding models

[02:32:54 - 02:32:58]
that we can utilize but we'll stick with

[02:32:56 - 02:33:00]
the default one here I don't know enough

[02:32:58 - 02:33:02]
about any of these to know but it might

[02:33:00 - 02:33:03]
be curious that like law GPT sounds

[02:33:02 - 02:33:06]
interesting sounds like it has something

[02:33:03 - 02:33:08]
to do with like Law data but so far we

[02:33:06 - 02:33:10]
are seeing

[02:33:08 - 02:33:13]
um uh that is Chinese text yeah that's

[02:33:10 - 02:33:16]
not Japanese I don't see any uh Japanese

[02:33:13 - 02:33:16]
text here

[02:33:16 - 02:33:21]
but yeah I'm not sure what about this

[02:33:19 - 02:33:23]
one but just kind of curious but anyway

[02:33:21 - 02:33:26]
so we're going to bring this one in here

[02:33:23 - 02:33:27]
okay I'm going to go ahead and hit play

[02:33:26 - 02:33:30]
it says name sentence transform is not

[02:33:27 - 02:33:31]
defined uh that's fair because we didn't

[02:33:30 - 02:33:34]
bring in the uh the definition so we'll

[02:33:31 - 02:33:35]
go back over to here I'm going to go

[02:33:34 - 02:33:38]
ahead and add a new code block and we'll

[02:33:35 - 02:33:41]
paste it into here I'll hit run

[02:33:38 - 02:33:41]
here we'll give it a

[02:33:42 - 02:33:49]
moment

[02:33:44 - 02:33:49]
okay and now it should be imported

[02:33:51 - 02:33:56]
um yeah we'll just wait a moment I'm not

[02:33:54 - 02:33:58]
sure why it's struggling so much here

[02:33:56 - 02:34:00]
but oh there we go and so we'll go ahead

[02:33:58 - 02:34:02]
and bring in this model now I don't know

[02:34:00 - 02:34:04]
how large this model is but I'm pretty

[02:34:02 - 02:34:06]
sure embedding models aren't as large as

[02:34:04 - 02:34:08]
a full large language model so I think

[02:34:06 - 02:34:10]
whatever compute we have here will be

[02:34:08 - 02:34:12]
fine we go up here to the top we can see

[02:34:10 - 02:34:13]
it says Python 3 Google compute engine

[02:34:12 - 02:34:18]
back

[02:34:13 - 02:34:20]
end um does it tell us anything

[02:34:18 - 02:34:22]
else I don't know but like you know it's

[02:34:20 - 02:34:23]
always good to know what kind of compute

[02:34:22 - 02:34:29]
you have and I always forget what Cod

[02:34:23 - 02:34:32]
laab has so cab um Google compute

[02:34:29 - 02:34:35]
free what is it

[02:34:32 - 02:34:38]
right including gpus tpus but what does

[02:34:35 - 02:34:38]
it provide I'm not

[02:34:39 - 02:34:44]
sure and here they say like what exactly

[02:34:41 - 02:34:46]
is the compu this is two years ago so

[02:34:44 - 02:34:50]
obviously probably out of

[02:34:46 - 02:34:50]
date um

[02:34:53 - 02:34:56]
so I'm not seeing at least I'm not

[02:34:54 - 02:34:58]
seeing any clear answers as to what it

[02:34:56 - 02:35:00]
is I know when we're using uh sagemaker

[02:34:58 - 02:35:02]
it's very clear sagemaker Studio Labs

[02:35:00 - 02:35:03]
it's very clear what it is underneath

[02:35:02 - 02:35:05]
but that's totally fine I think this

[02:35:03 - 02:35:07]
will work here in Google Cod lab there's

[02:35:05 - 02:35:08]
no reason why it wouldn't so we have

[02:35:07 - 02:35:09]
some sentences so the sentences we want

[02:35:08 - 02:35:12]
to encode I'll just bring these up here

[02:35:09 - 02:35:16]
a bit larger we'll go ahead and copy

[02:35:12 - 02:35:19]
this text we'll bring it on down and I'm

[02:35:16 - 02:35:21]
going to go ahead and paste this in here

[02:35:19 - 02:35:23]
and we'll go ahead and hit run the next

[02:35:21 - 02:35:27]
thing I want to do is I want to go ahead

[02:35:23 - 02:35:28]
and bring in our uh the actual

[02:35:27 - 02:35:30]
calculations I think this is yeah this

[02:35:28 - 02:35:32]
encodes the sentence to embedding so

[02:35:30 - 02:35:34]
this will actually give us the

[02:35:32 - 02:35:37]
embeddings and so I think shape is us

[02:35:34 - 02:35:40]
actually literally seeing the numbers so

[02:35:37 - 02:35:40]
we have three and

[02:35:41 - 02:35:44]
384 and this one is doing a comparison

[02:35:43 - 02:35:47]
of

[02:35:44 - 02:35:49]
embeddings so I think this is comparison

[02:35:47 - 02:35:51]
all other embeddings so we have three so

[02:35:49 - 02:35:52]
we have a grid of nine so it's comparing

[02:35:51 - 02:35:55]
it's basically making a matrices of

[02:35:52 - 02:35:55]
comparisons of them

[02:35:58 - 02:36:03]
all okay we'll go ahead and run this

[02:36:02 - 02:36:05]
great so we have our our comparison so

[02:36:03 - 02:36:08]
you might be asking okay we did this why

[02:36:05 - 02:36:09]
did we do this Andrew Well the idea

[02:36:08 - 02:36:11]
behind

[02:36:09 - 02:36:13]
embeddings is that we eventually want to

[02:36:11 - 02:36:15]
store this in a vector store right so

[02:36:13 - 02:36:16]
that we can find things that are similar

[02:36:15 - 02:36:18]
and this is specifically creating

[02:36:16 - 02:36:21]
embeddings for sentences right so

[02:36:18 - 02:36:23]
sentences that are compar terrible and

[02:36:21 - 02:36:25]
down below we are simply doing model.

[02:36:23 - 02:36:27]
similarity to say which ones are similar

[02:36:25 - 02:36:29]
and in a sense This Is Us doing kind of

[02:36:27 - 02:36:31]
like the search or fetch against let's

[02:36:29 - 02:36:34]
say if it wasn't a vector store it's not

[02:36:31 - 02:36:35]
but here we are basically performing

[02:36:34 - 02:36:38]
both the embedding and also the

[02:36:35 - 02:36:40]
comparison to then retrieve uh things

[02:36:38 - 02:36:42]
that are similar so hopefully that is uh

[02:36:40 - 02:36:46]
clear enough there's clearly a lot more

[02:36:42 - 02:36:48]
that we can uh do

[02:36:46 - 02:36:50]
here but I think that this is sufficient

[02:36:48 - 02:36:53]
I just want you to get some

[02:36:50 - 02:36:54]
exposure um to sentence Transformers and

[02:36:53 - 02:36:56]
you can see that it does a lot of things

[02:36:54 - 02:36:58]
so they say it can do Computing

[02:36:56 - 02:37:00]
embeddings uh semantic textual

[02:36:58 - 02:37:03]
similarity semantic search retrieve

[02:37:00 - 02:37:04]
rerank a lot of different stuff okay and

[02:37:03 - 02:37:06]
then it talks about the pre-trained

[02:37:04 - 02:37:08]
models down here which I didn't really

[02:37:06 - 02:37:12]
explore earlier but you can see there

[02:37:08 - 02:37:14]
are some uh that are here but hopefully

[02:37:12 - 02:37:16]
um it's very clear sentence Transformers

[02:37:14 - 02:37:17]
is for creating embedding specifically

[02:37:16 - 02:37:20]
for

[02:37:17 - 02:37:24]
sentences and so this example sample is

[02:37:20 - 02:37:25]
done and um I'm not sure if it's

[02:37:24 - 02:37:28]
necessary to save I'll just save that

[02:37:25 - 02:37:29]
there and uh yeah we are 100% done here

[02:37:28 - 02:37:32]
and hopefully you learned a little bit

[02:37:29 - 02:37:35]
about sentence Transformers

[02:37:32 - 02:37:38]
[Music]

[02:37:35 - 02:37:42]
okay let's take a look at what a

[02:37:38 - 02:37:44]
perceptron is so a perceptron is an

[02:37:42 - 02:37:48]
algorithm for supervised learning of

[02:37:44 - 02:37:51]
binary classifiers invented in

[02:37:48 - 02:37:54]
1943 and then the machine was built in

[02:37:51 - 02:37:57]
1957 so the Mark 1 perceptron which is

[02:37:54 - 02:38:00]
the name of the machine um it was able

[02:37:57 - 02:38:02]
to do some form of image recognition uh

[02:38:00 - 02:38:04]
what that would be I don't know I I

[02:38:02 - 02:38:07]
wasn't able to extrapolate that but you

[02:38:04 - 02:38:09]
can see all of the interconnected uh

[02:38:07 - 02:38:11]
work just kind of like the human brain

[02:38:09 - 02:38:15]
would have where you have these uh

[02:38:11 - 02:38:19]
connections and layers and so this is

[02:38:15 - 02:38:22]
kind of where the idea of a um of a neur

[02:38:19 - 02:38:25]
Network you know came from and the fact

[02:38:22 - 02:38:26]
that it's so old just shows you that

[02:38:25 - 02:38:29]
we've been doing ml longer than you

[02:38:26 - 02:38:31]
think but yeah hopefully that lays the

[02:38:29 - 02:38:35]
ground of of the word perceptron but

[02:38:31 - 02:38:38]
we'll take a look now at a perceptron

[02:38:35 - 02:38:40]
[Music]

[02:38:38 - 02:38:42]
network all right so let's take a look

[02:38:40 - 02:38:44]
at a basic perceptron Network and you

[02:38:42 - 02:38:48]
might be saying why are we so interested

[02:38:44 - 02:38:50]
in this very old um type of network it's

[02:38:48 - 02:38:53]
not old this is neural networks they are

[02:38:50 - 02:38:55]
perceptron networks um so you know just

[02:38:53 - 02:38:57]
as goes to show you that the concept is

[02:38:55 - 02:38:59]
not new it's just that we have now

[02:38:57 - 02:39:00]
scaled it and we have a lot more compute

[02:38:59 - 02:39:03]
and we're not connecting everything by

[02:39:00 - 02:39:06]
hand right so a basic perceptron has an

[02:39:03 - 02:39:09]
input and output layer each layer

[02:39:06 - 02:39:11]
contains a number of nodes nodes between

[02:39:09 - 02:39:14]
layers have established connections that

[02:39:11 - 02:39:15]
are weighted so here is that example the

[02:39:14 - 02:39:17]
amount of nodes in the input layer the

[02:39:15 - 02:39:20]
input layer right I'm going get my pen

[02:39:17 - 02:39:22]
out here over here is a determined by

[02:39:20 - 02:39:24]
the number of dimensions of the inputed

[02:39:22 - 02:39:26]
vector what does that mean the number of

[02:39:24 - 02:39:28]
dimensions of an inputed Vector so a

[02:39:26 - 02:39:31]
vector remember our our graph we're

[02:39:28 - 02:39:34]
taking a DOT and putting it somewhere so

[02:39:31 - 02:39:37]
if you had a graph um or a vector space

[02:39:34 - 02:39:41]
that had an X and A Y then you have two

[02:39:37 - 02:39:43]
inputs for the node right you have X and

[02:39:41 - 02:39:45]
Y and it doesn't have to be X and Y it

[02:39:43 - 02:39:47]
could be different kinds of values but

[02:39:45 - 02:39:51]
that's the point there okay so the input

[02:39:47 - 02:39:54]
layer is just connect ction points okay

[02:39:51 - 02:39:57]
this input layer nothing that this layer

[02:39:54 - 02:39:59]
does will modify the data okay just the

[02:39:57 - 02:40:02]
starting point for it so the amount of

[02:39:59 - 02:40:04]
nodes in the output layer is determined

[02:40:02 - 02:40:07]
by the application of the neural network

[02:40:04 - 02:40:09]
so if you have a yes and no

[02:40:07 - 02:40:12]
classification uh then you would only

[02:40:09 - 02:40:16]
have one output node because you just

[02:40:12 - 02:40:18]
want to know is it yes or is it no is it

[02:40:16 - 02:40:21]
zero or is it one so it would not matter

[02:40:18 - 02:40:24]
if there was a thousand input nodes but

[02:40:21 - 02:40:27]
if your classification is yes or no you

[02:40:24 - 02:40:29]
only need a single node for that right

[02:40:27 - 02:40:31]
the output nodes and other layers can

[02:40:29 - 02:40:33]
modify and compute new values based on

[02:40:31 - 02:40:36]
the inputed

[02:40:33 - 02:40:40]
data okay and so data moving between

[02:40:36 - 02:40:43]
nodes are uh are multiplied by the

[02:40:40 - 02:40:46]
weights right so that is what a weight

[02:40:43 - 02:40:48]
does it it affects uh the the strength

[02:40:46 - 02:40:50]
or the weakness of the number of what

[02:40:48 - 02:40:52]
you want to adjust it for the weights

[02:40:50 - 02:40:54]
will be modified during the training

[02:40:52 - 02:40:55]
process to produce a better outcome so

[02:40:54 - 02:40:58]
hopefully that is clear but the only

[02:40:55 - 02:41:00]
thing that's you don't see here is those

[02:40:58 - 02:41:02]
hidden layers those additional layers

[02:41:00 - 02:41:06]
but anyway we'll move on to now talking

[02:41:02 - 02:41:09]
about how the algorithm of the actual uh

[02:41:06 - 02:41:13]
um neural or the neuron works

[02:41:09 - 02:41:15]
[Music]

[02:41:13 - 02:41:17]
okay let's take a look at activation

[02:41:15 - 02:41:20]
function so when data arrives to a node

[02:41:17 - 02:41:23]
that that can perform a computation all

[02:41:20 - 02:41:25]
arriving inputed data is summed and then

[02:41:23 - 02:41:27]
an activation function is triggered so

[02:41:25 - 02:41:31]
the idea here is you have uh let's say

[02:41:27 - 02:41:34]
you have two um uh nodes and you have

[02:41:31 - 02:41:37]
connections to the the out the output

[02:41:34 - 02:41:40]
node notice that it's summing that is

[02:41:37 - 02:41:41]
the mathematical symbol for uh a sum and

[02:41:40 - 02:41:45]
then we have a

[02:41:41 - 02:41:46]
mathematical um uh symbol for a function

[02:41:45 - 02:41:48]
right so it's going to sum it and then

[02:41:46 - 02:41:50]
trigger the activation function so the

[02:41:48 - 02:41:52]
activ ation function acts as a gate

[02:41:50 - 02:41:55]
between nodes and determines whether

[02:41:52 - 02:41:56]
output will proceed to the next layer

[02:41:55 - 02:41:59]
the activ activation function will

[02:41:56 - 02:42:02]
determine if a node is active or

[02:41:59 - 02:42:04]
inactive based on its own output which

[02:42:02 - 02:42:07]
could be a range between zero to one to

[02:42:04 - 02:42:09]
negative one to zero and there's all

[02:42:07 - 02:42:12]
sorts of activation functions you can

[02:42:09 - 02:42:15]
put in here um and this is not the full

[02:42:12 - 02:42:17]
list and depending on if you're watching

[02:42:15 - 02:42:19]
a a beginner like because I'm going to

[02:42:17 - 02:42:22]
have this video in more than one course

[02:42:19 - 02:42:24]
so if you're in a beginner course we

[02:42:22 - 02:42:26]
will not show you uh the types of

[02:42:24 - 02:42:28]
activation functions like literally how

[02:42:26 - 02:42:30]
they work but in a more advanced ml1 we

[02:42:28 - 02:42:33]
will because you will want to know them

[02:42:30 - 02:42:34]
there so just understand that um you

[02:42:33 - 02:42:36]
know if you don't see exactly what these

[02:42:34 - 02:42:38]
look like it doesn't matter right now

[02:42:36 - 02:42:40]
okay so we have linear activation

[02:42:38 - 02:42:43]
function so it can't do back

[02:42:40 - 02:42:45]
propagation um that's what linear

[02:42:43 - 02:42:47]
activation functions can't do so here it

[02:42:45 - 02:42:49]
just passes along the data then we have

[02:42:47 - 02:42:51]
nonl linear activation functions so can

[02:42:49 - 02:42:54]
do back propagation can stack and have

[02:42:51 - 02:42:56]
many layers here we have binary steps so

[02:42:54 - 02:42:59]
if greater than threshold then activate

[02:42:56 - 02:43:00]
we have sigmoid used in binary

[02:42:59 - 02:43:03]
classification susceptible to to the

[02:43:00 - 02:43:05]
vanishing gradient problem these are

[02:43:03 - 02:43:07]
things again if you are doing real ml

[02:43:05 - 02:43:09]
with me here then we will talk about

[02:43:07 - 02:43:11]
them if you don't see it in the course

[02:43:09 - 02:43:15]
it's because I'm trying to make things

[02:43:11 - 02:43:16]
easy on you okay we have tan or tan I'm

[02:43:15 - 02:43:18]
not sure how to pronounce it this is a

[02:43:16 - 02:43:21]
modified skilled version of sigmoid

[02:43:18 - 02:43:23]
still susceptible to the vanishing gr uh

[02:43:21 - 02:43:26]
gradient problem which is something we

[02:43:23 - 02:43:28]
really want to avoid uh reu again I

[02:43:26 - 02:43:30]
don't know how to say it properly uh

[02:43:28 - 02:43:34]
mostly and we're missing an L there

[02:43:30 - 02:43:36]
nobody tell me that okay mostly commonly

[02:43:34 - 02:43:38]
used uh activation function will treat

[02:43:36 - 02:43:41]
any negative value as a zero we have

[02:43:38 - 02:43:43]
leaky relo this counters the dying relo

[02:43:41 - 02:43:48]
problem with a small slope of negative

[02:43:43 - 02:43:51]
values param relo so type of leaky relo

[02:43:48 - 02:43:54]
where the negative slope is fixed at

[02:43:51 - 02:43:57]
0.01x exponential linear unit similar to

[02:43:54 - 02:43:59]
relu no dying Ru problem saturates

[02:43:57 - 02:44:01]
negative large numbers we have switch

[02:43:59 - 02:44:04]
this is an alternative to uh to the reu

[02:44:01 - 02:44:07]
by the Google brain team max out used in

[02:44:04 - 02:44:10]
a in a max out layer choose the output

[02:44:07 - 02:44:11]
uh to be the max of inputs inputs soft

[02:44:10 - 02:44:12]
Max this is something you'll see a lot

[02:44:11 - 02:44:13]
if you're looking at architectural

[02:44:12 - 02:44:15]
diagrams like if you look at the

[02:44:13 - 02:44:17]
Transformer architecture look for the

[02:44:15 - 02:44:19]
word softmax you'll always see these

[02:44:17 - 02:44:22]
near the outputs converts these outputs

[02:44:19 - 02:44:24]
of probabilities for the multiple

[02:44:22 - 02:44:26]
classifications so yeah you know I might

[02:44:24 - 02:44:29]
cover these or we might not uh based on

[02:44:26 - 02:44:31]
that course but anyway uh that is the

[02:44:29 - 02:44:34]
activation functions

[02:44:31 - 02:44:37]
[Music]

[02:44:34 - 02:44:39]
okay all right so we're taking a look at

[02:44:37 - 02:44:41]
activation functions the first being the

[02:44:39 - 02:44:43]
linear activation function it is also

[02:44:41 - 02:44:45]
known as the identity function it's a

[02:44:43 - 02:44:46]
straight line as you can tell here the

[02:44:45 - 02:44:49]
model is not really learning it does not

[02:44:46 - 02:44:52]
improve upon uh the error term it cannot

[02:44:49 - 02:44:55]
perform back propagation it cannot stack

[02:44:52 - 02:44:57]
layers only ever has one layer this

[02:44:55 - 02:44:59]
means your model will behave if it's

[02:44:57 - 02:45:03]
linear so no longer handle complex

[02:44:59 - 02:45:05]
nonlinear data uh the range is that it's

[02:45:03 - 02:45:07]
Unbound so it's infinite it's derivative

[02:45:05 - 02:45:10]
one what you put in is what you get out

[02:45:07 - 02:45:12]
um so you know why would you want to use

[02:45:10 - 02:45:13]
this I think that it's used for inputs

[02:45:12 - 02:45:15]
um because you know if you're just

[02:45:13 - 02:45:17]
passing something along then that's

[02:45:15 - 02:45:19]
totally fine there but if you had

[02:45:17 - 02:45:20]
multiple hidden layers with this it's

[02:45:19 - 02:45:21]
not going to be very useful but there

[02:45:20 - 02:45:24]
you

[02:45:21 - 02:45:27]
[Music]

[02:45:24 - 02:45:28]
go let's take a look at binary step

[02:45:27 - 02:45:31]
activation function so this function

[02:45:28 - 02:45:33]
will either return 01 if the value is

[02:45:31 - 02:45:35]
zero or less it will return zero the

[02:45:33 - 02:45:37]
value is greater than zero it'll be uh

[02:45:35 - 02:45:39]
it'll be one and that's why it's called

[02:45:37 - 02:45:42]
a binary step function because it's

[02:45:39 - 02:45:44]
clearly in one place or or the other it

[02:45:42 - 02:45:46]
can only handle binary classification so

[02:45:44 - 02:45:49]
on or off or true or false it has a

[02:45:46 - 02:45:51]
range of zero or one it is bound so it's

[02:45:49 - 02:45:54]
not infinite it's one of the earliest

[02:45:51 - 02:45:56]
used activation functions not used much

[02:45:54 - 02:45:58]
today but you know when we were looking

[02:45:56 - 02:46:00]
at that example of like uh producing yes

[02:45:58 - 02:46:02]
or no you could see that this would be

[02:46:00 - 02:46:04]
the activation function on the output

[02:46:02 - 02:46:06]
function right because that'd be very

[02:46:04 - 02:46:08]
clear but you can see this is very very

[02:46:06 - 02:46:11]
simplistic

[02:46:08 - 02:46:14]
[Music]

[02:46:11 - 02:46:16]
okay let's take a look at the sigmoid

[02:46:14 - 02:46:17]
activation function which is a logistic

[02:46:16 - 02:46:20]
curve that resembles an S shape so there

[02:46:17 - 02:46:22]
it is it can handle binary multi

[02:46:20 - 02:46:25]
classifications so think Cow Horse pig

[02:46:22 - 02:46:28]
as we are looking at multiple types of

[02:46:25 - 02:46:31]
classific classification we can now

[02:46:28 - 02:46:32]
stack layers uh we have ranges between

[02:46:31 - 02:46:35]
zero and one it tends to bring the

[02:46:32 - 02:46:37]
activations to either side of the curve

[02:46:35 - 02:46:39]
with clear distinctions on prediction

[02:46:37 - 02:46:41]
one of the most widely used functions

[02:46:39 - 02:46:44]
near the end of the function y responds

[02:46:41 - 02:46:46]
less to X so this causes the vanishing

[02:46:44 - 02:46:47]
gradient what we're talking about we say

[02:46:46 - 02:46:49]
Vanishing gradient like look at this it

[02:46:47 - 02:46:51]
just goes in advance vanishes into the

[02:46:49 - 02:46:53]
gradient that's what it's talking about

[02:46:51 - 02:46:57]
the network refuses to learn further or

[02:46:53 - 02:46:59]
is distractedly slow so if values are

[02:46:57 - 02:47:02]
over here then you're going to run into

[02:46:59 - 02:47:04]
some trouble so sigmoid is analog

[02:47:02 - 02:47:07]
meaning almost all neurons will fire be

[02:47:04 - 02:47:11]
active activation will be both dense and

[02:47:07 - 02:47:13]
slow slowly and costly so think about

[02:47:11 - 02:47:15]
that um binary step because if it's

[02:47:13 - 02:47:17]
binary step it's either on or off um

[02:47:15 - 02:47:19]
because remember that the the purpose of

[02:47:17 - 02:47:22]
it is that if it's zero it's not going

[02:47:19 - 02:47:25]
to pass data along if it's one it is so

[02:47:22 - 02:47:27]
because this it I mean it it could

[02:47:25 - 02:47:29]
technically be zero but like even if

[02:47:27 - 02:47:31]
it's here it's a little bit on right

[02:47:29 - 02:47:35]
it's always on or it's it's like really

[02:47:31 - 02:47:36]
on or it's teeny tiny on right so um

[02:47:35 - 02:47:40]
there you

[02:47:36 - 02:47:42]
[Music]

[02:47:40 - 02:47:43]
go all right I want to admit something

[02:47:42 - 02:47:45]
that's really embarrassing but when we

[02:47:43 - 02:47:48]
initially listed out those activation

[02:47:45 - 02:47:51]
functions I think I swapped the h&n so I

[02:47:48 - 02:47:52]
called it tan H when it's just ton and

[02:47:51 - 02:47:54]
that's why I was saying ton before

[02:47:52 - 02:47:57]
because I'm like in my mind I knew it

[02:47:54 - 02:47:59]
was T but like the H was off so I said

[02:47:57 - 02:48:01]
tan8 so I do apologize for that but it

[02:47:59 - 02:48:04]
is ton and is the same as a sigmoid

[02:48:01 - 02:48:06]
function but it's scaled and it's made

[02:48:04 - 02:48:07]
larger so looks really really similar so

[02:48:06 - 02:48:09]
it can handle binary multi

[02:48:07 - 02:48:11]
classification because it's analog just

[02:48:09 - 02:48:14]
like the other one we can stack layers

[02:48:11 - 02:48:16]
we have ranges between ne1 and one the

[02:48:14 - 02:48:19]
gradient is stronger so it has a a

[02:48:16 - 02:48:21]
steeper curve it still has a anage ing

[02:48:19 - 02:48:23]
gradient problem like the sigid um but

[02:48:21 - 02:48:26]
versus ton and sigmoid is based on your

[02:48:23 - 02:48:28]
use case so ton can assist in to avoid

[02:48:26 - 02:48:31]
bias ingradients ton can outperform

[02:48:28 - 02:48:32]
sigmoid so you know it's depends if you

[02:48:31 - 02:48:36]
need to do it or not

[02:48:32 - 02:48:39]
[Music]

[02:48:36 - 02:48:42]
right let's take a look here at REO so

[02:48:39 - 02:48:44]
reu stands for rectified linear unit

[02:48:42 - 02:48:47]
activation function where the positive

[02:48:44 - 02:48:50]
axis is linear and the negative axis is

[02:48:47 - 02:48:51]
always zero so it looks like that and

[02:48:50 - 02:48:53]
again just remember the point of

[02:48:51 - 02:48:57]
activation functions is that it's either

[02:48:53 - 02:49:00]
on or off or always on to to some degree

[02:48:57 - 02:49:02]
or not um so here the range is zero to

[02:49:00 - 02:49:03]
infinite so we have a positive axis that

[02:49:02 - 02:49:08]
is

[02:49:03 - 02:49:10]
Unbound um so with sigmoid and T ton it

[02:49:08 - 02:49:12]
fires almost all the neurons and this

[02:49:10 - 02:49:15]
leads to things being dense remember we

[02:49:12 - 02:49:17]
said dense as in um there's it's adding

[02:49:15 - 02:49:20]
more information as it goes as opposed

[02:49:17 - 02:49:24]
to being the same or less it's slow it's

[02:49:20 - 02:49:26]
costly um so the uh reu is Will Will

[02:49:24 - 02:49:28]
sparsely trigger activation functions

[02:49:26 - 02:49:31]
because of its negative axis gradient

[02:49:28 - 02:49:33]
being zero so you have um you know if

[02:49:31 - 02:49:36]
something is really low it's going to be

[02:49:33 - 02:49:39]
zero it's not going to um be a teeny

[02:49:36 - 02:49:42]
tiny bit on it's less costly but it's

[02:49:39 - 02:49:44]
more uh efficient so it's a lot faster

[02:49:42 - 02:49:46]
the negative axis with a zero gradient

[02:49:44 - 02:49:48]
has a side effect called the reu dying

[02:49:46 - 02:49:50]
gradient so the gradient will go towards

[02:49:48 - 02:49:52]
zero and will be stuck in zero because

[02:49:50 - 02:49:55]
variations adjusting due to input or

[02:49:52 - 02:49:59]
error will have nothing to uh nothing to

[02:49:55 - 02:50:02]
adjust to so the nodes essentially die

[02:49:59 - 02:50:05]
[Music]

[02:50:02 - 02:50:08]
okay let's take a look at leaky REO

[02:50:05 - 02:50:10]
activation function so leaky rectified

[02:50:08 - 02:50:13]
linear unit activation function is where

[02:50:10 - 02:50:15]
the positive axis is linear and the

[02:50:13 - 02:50:17]
negative axis has a gentle gradient

[02:50:15 - 02:50:18]
closer to zero do you notice that every

[02:50:17 - 02:50:20]
time we look at one of these it's trying

[02:50:18 - 02:50:22]
to solve a problem and and try to be

[02:50:20 - 02:50:23]
better so hopefully you're seeing that

[02:50:22 - 02:50:26]
as we go through these activation

[02:50:23 - 02:50:29]
functions so is similar to the reu but

[02:50:26 - 02:50:31]
it reduces the effects of the REO dying

[02:50:29 - 02:50:34]
gradient it's leaky because the negative

[02:50:31 - 02:50:38]
axis leaks which causes some nodes not

[02:50:34 - 02:50:40]
to die uh we have uh also paramed REO

[02:50:38 - 02:50:41]
which is leaky uh REO where the negative

[02:50:40 - 02:50:47]
slope is

[02:50:41 - 02:50:48]
0 uh or Z negative 01 we have Ru 6 uh

[02:50:47 - 02:50:51]
where we have Ru where the positive axis

[02:50:48 - 02:50:53]
has an upper limit so it's not infinite

[02:50:51 - 02:50:55]
uh so the idea here it's bound to a max

[02:50:53 - 02:50:59]
value

[02:50:55 - 02:51:01]
[Music]

[02:50:59 - 02:51:03]
okay let's take a look here at

[02:51:01 - 02:51:05]
exponential linear unit also known as

[02:51:03 - 02:51:08]
elu it has a slope towards a negative

[02:51:05 - 02:51:10]
one axis it has a linear gradient in the

[02:51:08 - 02:51:13]
positive axis so that's what it looks

[02:51:10 - 02:51:15]
like kind of like um uh what was the

[02:51:13 - 02:51:18]
last one I pr forgot it was called but

[02:51:15 - 02:51:21]
uh you know the one where it was zero in

[02:51:18 - 02:51:24]
in the uh One Direction there but anyway

[02:51:21 - 02:51:28]
so something between yeah reu and and

[02:51:24 - 02:51:30]
leaky reu um so elu slope slopes towards

[02:51:28 - 02:51:32]
the negative 1 negative value it pushes

[02:51:30 - 02:51:34]
the mean of the activation closer to

[02:51:32 - 02:51:36]
zero meaning activation closer to zero

[02:51:34 - 02:51:40]
causes faster learning and convergence

[02:51:36 - 02:51:42]
uh elu avoids the dying uh elu problem

[02:51:40 - 02:51:44]
it saturates for larger negative numbers

[02:51:42 - 02:51:47]
so everything is a trade-off with these

[02:51:44 - 02:51:47]
things okay

[02:51:49 - 02:51:53]
let's take a look at the swish

[02:51:51 - 02:51:55]
activation function so it has a slope

[02:51:53 - 02:51:57]
that dips and eases out to zero in the

[02:51:55 - 02:52:00]
negative axis it has a linear gradient

[02:51:57 - 02:52:02]
in the positive access so kind of looks

[02:52:00 - 02:52:04]
similar but like a little bit different

[02:52:02 - 02:52:06]
Swit was proposed by the Google brain

[02:52:04 - 02:52:07]
team as a replacement for reu it's

[02:52:06 - 02:52:10]
called switch because of its swishing

[02:52:07 - 02:52:12]
dip it looks similar to relu but it's a

[02:52:10 - 02:52:16]
smooth function it never abruptly

[02:52:12 - 02:52:19]
changes Direction it it is non monotonic

[02:52:16 - 02:52:23]
so it does not remain stable similar to

[02:52:19 - 02:52:25]
relu we'll have sparity very negative uh

[02:52:23 - 02:52:26]
very negative values will Zero out there

[02:52:25 - 02:52:30]
are other variants in the Swit family so

[02:52:26 - 02:52:33]
we have Mish hard Swish and hard

[02:52:30 - 02:52:36]
[Music]

[02:52:33 - 02:52:38]
Mish let's take a look at max out so

[02:52:36 - 02:52:39]
this is a function that uh that will

[02:52:38 - 02:52:43]
take multiple inputs and it will select

[02:52:39 - 02:52:45]
the maximum value and return the value

[02:52:43 - 02:52:48]
so um the max out is a generalization of

[02:52:45 - 02:52:50]
relu and the Leaky relu functions max

[02:52:48 - 02:52:53]
out uh neuron would have all the

[02:52:50 - 02:52:56]
benefits of reu neurons without having

[02:52:53 - 02:52:58]
the dying REO max out is uh is that is

[02:52:56 - 02:53:00]
expensive as it doubles the number of

[02:52:58 - 02:53:04]
parameters for each

[02:53:00 - 02:53:06]
[Music]

[02:53:04 - 02:53:09]
neuron all here's our last one the soft

[02:53:06 - 02:53:11]
Max activation function this is uh it

[02:53:09 - 02:53:14]
will calculate the probabilities of each

[02:53:11 - 02:53:17]
class over all possible classes when

[02:53:14 - 02:53:19]
used for multiclassification models it

[02:53:17 - 02:53:22]
Returns the probabilities of each class

[02:53:19 - 02:53:24]
and the target class will have the high

[02:53:22 - 02:53:26]
probability uh the calculated

[02:53:24 - 02:53:28]
probabilties Pro probabilities will be

[02:53:26 - 02:53:31]
in the range of zero and one the sum of

[02:53:28 - 02:53:34]
all probabilities is equal to one

[02:53:31 - 02:53:36]
softmac functions is generally used in

[02:53:34 - 02:53:38]
multiple classifications on the output

[02:53:36 - 02:53:41]
layer so again I said if you look at the

[02:53:38 - 02:53:43]
Transformer architecture which probably

[02:53:41 - 02:53:45]
is in this course you will see it there

[02:53:43 - 02:53:48]
and you'll see it in other ml models U

[02:53:45 - 02:53:50]
diagrams for sure you can only assign a

[02:53:48 - 02:53:52]
sing single label to a probability for

[02:53:50 - 02:53:55]
this

[02:53:52 - 02:53:59]
[Music]

[02:53:55 - 02:54:02]
okay let's define a algorithm and a

[02:53:59 - 02:54:04]
function so an algorithm is a set of

[02:54:02 - 02:54:07]
mathematical or computer instructions to

[02:54:04 - 02:54:10]
perform a specific task and an algorithm

[02:54:07 - 02:54:13]
can be composed of several smaller

[02:54:10 - 02:54:15]
algorithms you're basically saying how

[02:54:13 - 02:54:17]
do you do something that's what an

[02:54:15 - 02:54:20]
algorithm is right how are we going to

[02:54:17 - 02:54:22]
do something um so I want to take a look

[02:54:20 - 02:54:25]
here at the K nearest neighbor KNN

[02:54:22 - 02:54:28]
algorithm which can be used to create a

[02:54:25 - 02:54:31]
supervised classification machine uh

[02:54:28 - 02:54:33]
learning algorithm so tell me who are

[02:54:31 - 02:54:36]
your closest neighbors and we will infer

[02:54:33 - 02:54:39]
that uh that I can be considered of the

[02:54:36 - 02:54:44]
same class so within KNN you can use

[02:54:39 - 02:54:48]
different distance metrics uh such as uh

[02:54:44 - 02:54:50]
idian Hamming uh minski Manhattan so

[02:54:48 - 02:54:52]
there's all different ones that you can

[02:54:50 - 02:54:55]
utilize um a function is a way of

[02:54:52 - 02:54:57]
grouping algorithms together uh so you

[02:54:55 - 02:54:59]
can call them to compute a result so

[02:54:57 - 02:55:01]
sounds like a machine learning model

[02:54:59 - 02:55:04]
right where you have a grouping of

[02:55:01 - 02:55:05]
algorithms so you know look at this k

[02:55:04 - 02:55:09]
and end just here for a moment because

[02:55:05 - 02:55:11]
we do uh see this happen a lot but K

[02:55:09 - 02:55:13]
nearest neighbor is just like how close

[02:55:11 - 02:55:16]
am I from here to here to here to here

[02:55:13 - 02:55:19]
it's literally in the name how who are

[02:55:16 - 02:55:21]
my nearest neighbors okay so KNN itself

[02:55:19 - 02:55:23]
is not machine learning but when applied

[02:55:21 - 02:55:28]
to solve machine learning problem it

[02:55:23 - 02:55:31]
makes it a machine learning algorithm

[02:55:28 - 02:55:33]
[Music]

[02:55:31 - 02:55:35]
okay let's take a look at what a machine

[02:55:33 - 02:55:37]
learning model is but before we do that

[02:55:35 - 02:55:40]
let's define what a model is in general

[02:55:37 - 02:55:42]
terms so in general terms a model is

[02:55:40 - 02:55:46]
information representation of an object

[02:55:42 - 02:55:48]
person or system models can be concrete

[02:55:46 - 02:55:51]
so they have a physical form think a

[02:55:48 - 02:55:53]
design of a vehicle a person posing for

[02:55:51 - 02:55:56]
a picture then you have abstract so

[02:55:53 - 02:55:58]
Express as behavioral patterns think

[02:55:56 - 02:56:01]
mathematical computer code written words

[02:55:58 - 02:56:03]
so what is a machine learning model then

[02:56:01 - 02:56:05]
an ml model is a function that takes uh

[02:56:03 - 02:56:07]
in data performs a machine learning

[02:56:05 - 02:56:09]
algorithm to produce a prediction the

[02:56:07 - 02:56:12]
machine learning model is trained not to

[02:56:09 - 02:56:15]
be confused with the training model

[02:56:12 - 02:56:18]
which is learning to make correct

[02:56:15 - 02:56:20]
predictions uh an ml model can be the

[02:56:18 - 02:56:23]
training model that is just deployed

[02:56:20 - 02:56:25]
once it has been tuned to make good

[02:56:23 - 02:56:29]
predictions so normally you'd have

[02:56:25 - 02:56:31]
training data let's say labeled data and

[02:56:29 - 02:56:33]
here you are going to have your learning

[02:56:31 - 02:56:35]
algorithm and you're going to put it

[02:56:33 - 02:56:37]
through training so that's your training

[02:56:35 - 02:56:40]
model and then you have hyper tuning

[02:56:37 - 02:56:42]
where you are continuously tweaking the

[02:56:40 - 02:56:46]
model to get it to where you want it to

[02:56:42 - 02:56:48]
be okay then once you deploy the model

[02:56:46 - 02:56:52]
that is your trained model your machine

[02:56:48 - 02:56:55]
learning model which can go and produce

[02:56:52 - 02:56:58]
predictions um and from here you could

[02:56:55 - 02:57:00]
then provide it unlabeled data because

[02:56:58 - 02:57:02]
you know its goal is to make predictions

[02:57:00 - 02:57:07]
and that could be labeling data or doing

[02:57:02 - 02:57:09]
other things okay and we call uh uh uh

[02:57:07 - 02:57:11]
the interaction with the deployed

[02:57:09 - 02:57:14]
machine learning model inference right

[02:57:11 - 02:57:16]
so when you are inferring something you

[02:57:14 - 02:57:19]
are providing you're providing data and

[02:57:16 - 02:57:24]
saying hey can you uh make a prediction

[02:57:19 - 02:57:27]
for me and that's what inference is

[02:57:24 - 02:57:29]
[Music]

[02:57:27 - 02:57:31]
okay so let's take a look at what a

[02:57:29 - 02:57:33]
feature is so a feature is a

[02:57:31 - 02:57:34]
characteristic extracted from our

[02:57:33 - 02:57:36]
unstructured data set that has been

[02:57:34 - 02:57:39]
prepared to be ingested by our machine

[02:57:36 - 02:57:40]
learning model to infer a prediction so

[02:57:39 - 02:57:43]
ml models generally only accept

[02:57:40 - 02:57:46]
numerical data and so we prepare our

[02:57:43 - 02:57:49]
data into machine readable format by

[02:57:46 - 02:57:52]
encoding which will visit later in more

[02:57:49 - 02:57:54]
detail um so let's talk about what is

[02:57:52 - 02:57:57]
feature engineering so feature

[02:57:54 - 02:58:00]
engineering is the process of extracting

[02:57:57 - 02:58:03]
features from our provided data sources

[02:58:00 - 02:58:05]
so imagine you have your data sources

[02:58:03 - 02:58:08]
which you have then your raw data you're

[02:58:05 - 02:58:10]
going to clean and transform them into

[02:58:08 - 02:58:13]
features turning them into machine

[02:58:10 - 02:58:15]
readable format information for your

[02:58:13 - 02:58:20]
machine learning models and then you

[02:58:15 - 02:58:20]
know you go from there okay

[02:58:21 - 02:58:24]
[Music]

[02:58:22 - 02:58:25]
so what is inference inference is the

[02:58:24 - 02:58:27]
act of requesting and getting a

[02:58:25 - 02:58:29]
prediction and when we're talking about

[02:58:27 - 02:58:31]
in the context of machine learning we're

[02:58:29 - 02:58:32]
inputting data into a machine learning

[02:58:31 - 02:58:34]
model that has been deployed for

[02:58:32 - 02:58:37]
production use to then output a

[02:58:34 - 02:58:40]
prediction so imagine our raw data is a

[02:58:37 - 02:58:42]
banana and we tell we say tell me what

[02:58:40 - 02:58:45]
this is to the machine learning model

[02:58:42 - 02:58:46]
it's going to bring back information so

[02:58:45 - 02:58:49]
it's saying it's a yellow banana and it

[02:58:46 - 02:58:51]
has a confidence score of 0. .9 so if we

[02:58:49 - 02:58:54]
talk about the inference textbook

[02:58:51 - 02:58:57]
definition it's steps in reasoning or

[02:58:54 - 02:58:59]
moving from premise to logical

[02:58:57 - 02:59:00]
consequence but I think that it's easy

[02:58:59 - 02:59:04]
to remember as the act of requesting and

[02:59:00 - 02:59:07]
getting a prediction

[02:59:04 - 02:59:10]
[Music]

[02:59:07 - 02:59:12]
okay let's talk about parameters and

[02:59:10 - 02:59:13]
hyperparameters so a model parameter is

[02:59:12 - 02:59:16]
a variable that configures the internal

[02:59:13 - 02:59:18]
state of a model and whose value can be

[02:59:16 - 02:59:19]
estimated the value of parameter is not

[02:59:18 - 02:59:21]
manually set and will be learned

[02:59:19 - 02:59:23]
outputed after training parameters are

[02:59:21 - 02:59:26]
used to make predictions then we have

[02:59:23 - 02:59:27]
model hyp or model hyper parameter this

[02:59:26 - 02:59:30]
is a variable that is external to the

[02:59:27 - 02:59:31]
model and whose value cannot be

[02:59:30 - 02:59:33]
estimated the value of the hyper

[02:59:31 - 02:59:35]
parameter is manually set before the

[02:59:33 - 02:59:38]
training of the model hyperparameters

[02:59:35 - 02:59:39]
are used to estimate model parameters

[02:59:38 - 02:59:42]
and so we have things like learning rate

[02:59:39 - 02:59:44]
EPO and batch size and here's kind of a

[02:59:42 - 02:59:46]
diagram hopefully it helps make sense

[02:59:44 - 02:59:49]
but imagine you have a variable and you

[02:59:46 - 02:59:51]
want to input it into your model right

[02:59:49 - 02:59:52]
and we'll just make a box here to

[02:59:51 - 02:59:55]
indicate that this is the model it's

[02:59:52 - 02:59:58]
going to go into layers right and we'll

[02:59:55 - 03:00:02]
talk about this again later on but uh

[02:59:58 - 03:00:05]
parameters are the connections between

[03:00:02 - 03:00:07]
uh nodes okay so the idea is that this

[03:00:05 - 03:00:10]
will have a variable or a value and it

[03:00:07 - 03:00:13]
will have a weight and those are those

[03:00:10 - 03:00:15]
internal State those parameters okay so

[03:00:13 - 03:00:17]
hopefully uh that is very clear there

[03:00:15 - 03:00:19]
because the idea is that when you want

[03:00:17 - 03:00:22]
to uh utilize something for training

[03:00:19 - 03:00:24]
right you're going to pass um V like a a

[03:00:22 - 03:00:26]
Content or variables it's going to go

[03:00:24 - 03:00:27]
through all those layers and then all

[03:00:26 - 03:00:29]
these connections have to be set these

[03:00:27 - 03:00:31]
parameters of these connections have to

[03:00:29 - 03:00:33]
be set so you get the result that you

[03:00:31 - 03:00:36]
want to get so hopefully that is clear

[03:00:33 - 03:00:38]
but we will cover it again um if it's

[03:00:36 - 03:00:41]
not clear later on

[03:00:38 - 03:00:43]
[Music]

[03:00:41 - 03:00:46]
okay hey this is Andrew Brown let's take

[03:00:43 - 03:00:48]
a look at responsible AI specifically

[03:00:46 - 03:00:51]
for ads and often you'll see like a list

[03:00:48 - 03:00:54]
of things like fairness explainability

[03:00:51 - 03:00:57]
privacy and security safety

[03:00:54 - 03:00:58]
controllability veracity robustness

[03:00:57 - 03:01:01]
governance and transparency so this is

[03:00:58 - 03:01:03]
the one that adab us defines other ones

[03:01:01 - 03:01:05]
uh like Microsoft and other people have

[03:01:03 - 03:01:07]
similar lists so they're more or less

[03:01:05 - 03:01:09]
the same but for the exams for the AI

[03:01:07 - 03:01:11]
practitioner they might give you a list

[03:01:09 - 03:01:12]
of these so you might want to remember

[03:01:11 - 03:01:15]
those key terms let's go ahead and see

[03:01:12 - 03:01:17]
what we have in terms of resources for

[03:01:15 - 03:01:20]
responsible AI here so we have model

[03:01:17 - 03:01:22]
evaluation on Amazon Bedrock we have

[03:01:20 - 03:01:24]
Amazon sagemaker clarify we do look at

[03:01:22 - 03:01:26]
that later that's for explainable AI to

[03:01:24 - 03:01:28]
determine what's going on there and

[03:01:26 - 03:01:29]
again we have guard rails we have a lab

[03:01:28 - 03:01:32]
on that so we look at that we have

[03:01:29 - 03:01:35]
clarify again clarify again model

[03:01:32 - 03:01:37]
monitor which is more about monitoring

[03:01:35 - 03:01:39]
the degration of a model we do talk

[03:01:37 - 03:01:42]
about that Amazon augmented AI that is a

[03:01:39 - 03:01:45]
human reviewing the end points so all

[03:01:42 - 03:01:47]
these things are covered um yeah it

[03:01:45 - 03:01:49]
doesn't look like they have a whole lot

[03:01:47 - 03:01:51]
here we'll see eight a service cards

[03:01:49 - 03:01:53]
provides transfering document intended

[03:01:51 - 03:01:55]
use cases for fairness so I know

[03:01:53 - 03:01:58]
Microsoft has something very

[03:01:55 - 03:02:00]
similar um but uh yeah I guess they're

[03:01:58 - 03:02:03]
just down below

[03:02:00 - 03:02:05]
here not super exciting to be

[03:02:03 - 03:02:07]
honest yeah you got a bunch of stuff you

[03:02:05 - 03:02:10]
can read through so you can see how

[03:02:07 - 03:02:10]
they're being responsible with it I

[03:02:11 - 03:02:16]
guess and yeah so nothing super super

[03:02:14 - 03:02:18]
exciting here but um yeah I guess

[03:02:16 - 03:02:20]
clarifies their big thing here

[03:02:18 - 03:02:24]
remembering this list

[03:02:20 - 03:02:27]
[Music]

[03:02:24 - 03:02:29]
okay all right let's compare AI versus

[03:02:27 - 03:02:32]
generative AI first starting with AI so

[03:02:29 - 03:02:34]
what is AI it is computer systems that

[03:02:32 - 03:02:36]
perform tasks typically requiring human

[03:02:34 - 03:02:39]
intelligence this includes problem

[03:02:36 - 03:02:41]
solving decision making understanding

[03:02:39 - 03:02:44]
natural language recognizing speech and

[03:02:41 - 03:02:47]
images um and the ai's goal is to

[03:02:44 - 03:02:51]
interpret analyze and respond to Human

[03:02:47 - 03:02:54]
Action to simulate human intelligence in

[03:02:51 - 03:02:56]
machines and I create a large emphasis

[03:02:54 - 03:02:58]
on the word simulate because it's not

[03:02:56 - 03:03:00]
emulating so simulate is where we are

[03:02:58 - 03:03:03]
mimicking aspects resembling the

[03:03:00 - 03:03:05]
behaviors of humans or other things

[03:03:03 - 03:03:08]
emulation is when we're actually

[03:03:05 - 03:03:11]
replicating exact processes in machines

[03:03:08 - 03:03:13]
it's the real virtualization of the the

[03:03:11 - 03:03:15]
human mind and you could say that's

[03:03:13 - 03:03:17]
pretty much AGI so the artificial

[03:03:15 - 03:03:20]
general intelligence but um the point

[03:03:17 - 03:03:23]
new is that AI is a simulation not an

[03:03:20 - 03:03:26]
emulation AI applications are vast

[03:03:23 - 03:03:28]
includes areas such as expert systems

[03:03:26 - 03:03:32]
natural language processing speech

[03:03:28 - 03:03:34]
recognition Robotics and more um for

[03:03:32 - 03:03:36]
Industries it's across the board if

[03:03:34 - 03:03:38]
you're talking about B Toc everyone's

[03:03:36 - 03:03:40]
probably experienced a customer service

[03:03:38 - 03:03:43]
chatot I hate them but that is probably

[03:03:40 - 03:03:45]
the number one use for uh gen or AI uh

[03:03:43 - 03:03:48]
we have e-commerce so recommendation

[03:03:45 - 03:03:49]
systems so think like using Amazon on

[03:03:48 - 03:03:52]
and maybe it's using AI there and you're

[03:03:49 - 03:03:56]
not aware of it automous driving

[03:03:52 - 03:03:57]
vehicles um Medical Diagnostic so lots

[03:03:56 - 03:03:59]
of verticals there for different

[03:03:57 - 03:04:02]
Industries let's talk about generative

[03:03:59 - 03:04:05]
AI so generative AI is a subset of AI

[03:04:02 - 03:04:07]
focusing on creating new content or data

[03:04:05 - 03:04:09]
that is novel and realistic it can

[03:04:07 - 03:04:11]
interpret or analyze data but also

[03:04:09 - 03:04:13]
generates new data itself it often

[03:04:11 - 03:04:16]
involves Advanced machine learning

[03:04:13 - 03:04:18]
techniques so we got our Gans our vaes

[03:04:16 - 03:04:19]
our GPT

[03:04:18 - 03:04:21]
like the transformer models and we're

[03:04:19 - 03:04:24]
going to be talking about Transformers

[03:04:21 - 03:04:28]
not uh Autobots and Decepticons but

[03:04:24 - 03:04:29]
actual uh architecture for llms I really

[03:04:28 - 03:04:31]
should throw in some uh some of those if

[03:04:29 - 03:04:34]
they weren't copyright I would have them

[03:04:31 - 03:04:36]
in there uh generi has multiple

[03:04:34 - 03:04:38]
modalities and if you've never heard the

[03:04:36 - 03:04:41]
word modalities think of it like senses

[03:04:38 - 03:04:43]
you know you have Vision you have touch

[03:04:41 - 03:04:47]
you have taste things like that so for

[03:04:43 - 03:04:51]
jni we have uh things for vision for

[03:04:47 - 03:04:53]
text for audio right uh and there are

[03:04:51 - 03:04:54]
some odd ones like molecular so

[03:04:53 - 03:04:58]
something that generative ey can do is

[03:04:54 - 03:05:01]
it can do a a drug Discovery via genomic

[03:04:58 - 03:05:03]
data hopefully I'm saying that correctly

[03:05:01 - 03:05:07]
um and a lot of people associate

[03:05:03 - 03:05:09]
generative AI with large language models

[03:05:07 - 03:05:12]
which generate out human like text and

[03:05:09 - 03:05:15]
is a subset of gen but it's often

[03:05:12 - 03:05:17]
conflated with being AI due to it being

[03:05:15 - 03:05:21]
the most popular and developed and it

[03:05:17 - 03:05:23]
has strong correlation to the text

[03:05:21 - 03:05:27]
modality because they usually do that

[03:05:23 - 03:05:29]
but um large langu of models can be

[03:05:27 - 03:05:31]
multimodal uh meaning that they can work

[03:05:29 - 03:05:33]
across multiple modalities but it's

[03:05:31 - 03:05:34]
mostly text so let's just sum this up

[03:05:33 - 03:05:38]
and make sure we know the distinction

[03:05:34 - 03:05:40]
between Ai and gen so AI is focused on

[03:05:38 - 03:05:42]
understanding decision- making gen is

[03:05:40 - 03:05:44]
about creating new and original outputs

[03:05:42 - 03:05:47]
that doesn't mean that J can't do the

[03:05:44 - 03:05:50]
the former but it has that added benefit

[03:05:47 - 03:05:52]
of generation for data handling it AI

[03:05:50 - 03:05:54]
analyze analyzes and make decisions

[03:05:52 - 03:05:57]
based on existing data gen uses existing

[03:05:54 - 03:06:01]
data to generate new data and unseen

[03:05:57 - 03:06:03]
outputs for applications um AI is

[03:06:01 - 03:06:06]
generally more applicable because you

[03:06:03 - 03:06:10]
know it just is whereas gen is very

[03:06:06 - 03:06:14]
focused on Creative uh uh Innovative

[03:06:10 - 03:06:15]
generation of synthetic stuff um and

[03:06:14 - 03:06:17]
that M threw me off there it's not

[03:06:15 - 03:06:18]
supposed to be there but I think you

[03:06:17 - 03:06:20]
understand the distinction between the

[03:06:18 - 03:06:23]
two and there you

[03:06:20 - 03:06:25]
[Music]

[03:06:23 - 03:06:27]
go hey this is angrew brown and we are

[03:06:25 - 03:06:29]
taking a look at what is a foundational

[03:06:27 - 03:06:31]
model so a foundational model is a

[03:06:29 - 03:06:34]
general purpose model that is trained on

[03:06:31 - 03:06:37]
vast amounts of data we say that a

[03:06:34 - 03:06:40]
foundation model is pre-trained because

[03:06:37 - 03:06:42]
it can be fine-tuned for specific tasks

[03:06:40 - 03:06:44]
so just remember we are training the

[03:06:42 - 03:06:46]
model and we're going to say that it's a

[03:06:44 - 03:06:49]
pre-trained model but imagine text

[03:06:46 - 03:06:52]
images video structure data all sorts of

[03:06:49 - 03:06:53]
data massive massive amounts of data

[03:06:52 - 03:06:55]
that is going to produce your

[03:06:53 - 03:06:57]
foundational model and from that

[03:06:55 - 03:06:59]
foundational model it could do all sorts

[03:06:57 - 03:07:02]
of things prediction classification text

[03:06:59 - 03:07:04]
generation it might be limited to very

[03:07:02 - 03:07:08]
specific things that it can do but the

[03:07:04 - 03:07:10]
point is that it can do a lot of things

[03:07:08 - 03:07:12]
um and the reason I want to bring up

[03:07:10 - 03:07:14]
foundational model is because you hear

[03:07:12 - 03:07:15]
it a lot when we're talking about llms

[03:07:14 - 03:07:17]
and it becomes a bit confusing how to

[03:07:15 - 03:07:20]
distinguish it between llms and a

[03:07:17 - 03:07:22]
foundational model but llms are a

[03:07:20 - 03:07:25]
specialized subset of foundational

[03:07:22 - 03:07:27]
models they are foundational models that

[03:07:25 - 03:07:30]
uses Transformer architecture so if you

[03:07:27 - 03:07:32]
remember that that llms are foundational

[03:07:30 - 03:07:34]
models but they're specifically using

[03:07:32 - 03:07:38]
the Transformer architecture then that

[03:07:34 - 03:07:42]
will help make a whole lot of sense

[03:07:38 - 03:07:44]
[Music]

[03:07:42 - 03:07:45]
okay let's talk about large language

[03:07:44 - 03:07:47]
models this is going to be short even

[03:07:45 - 03:07:49]
though there's a lot you can say about

[03:07:47 - 03:07:51]
it I just want you to remember a key

[03:07:49 - 03:07:54]
thing about large language models so a

[03:07:51 - 03:07:56]
large language model is a foundational

[03:07:54 - 03:07:57]
model that implements the Transformer

[03:07:56 - 03:07:59]
architecture and we're going to spend a

[03:07:57 - 03:08:01]
bit of time learning about the

[03:07:59 - 03:08:05]
Transformer architecture in upcoming

[03:08:01 - 03:08:07]
videos but uh the idea is that um you

[03:08:05 - 03:08:08]
have natural language I can get my pen

[03:08:07 - 03:08:10]
tool out here so we have natural

[03:08:08 - 03:08:13]
language as our input it goes to the

[03:08:10 - 03:08:16]
large language model it predicts uh

[03:08:13 - 03:08:19]
output for words and as it produces each

[03:08:16 - 03:08:23]
word it feeds it back back in and

[03:08:19 - 03:08:25]
continues um to produce until it is done

[03:08:23 - 03:08:28]
so during the training phase the model

[03:08:25 - 03:08:30]
learns semantics or patterns of language

[03:08:28 - 03:08:32]
such as grammar word usage sentence

[03:08:30 - 03:08:35]
structure style and tone that's what

[03:08:32 - 03:08:37]
makes it so good at at uh interpreting

[03:08:35 - 03:08:40]
uh uh language and giving things that

[03:08:37 - 03:08:44]
sound with uh language understanding

[03:08:40 - 03:08:47]
because it has that ability to um

[03:08:44 - 03:08:49]
understand the semantics of language it

[03:08:47 - 03:08:51]
would be simple to say that llms just

[03:08:49 - 03:08:53]
predicts predict the next sequence of

[03:08:51 - 03:08:54]
words because as you use the model it

[03:08:53 - 03:08:56]
outputs a word on the end of it and

[03:08:54 - 03:08:59]
keeps feeding in and in and in and in

[03:08:56 - 03:09:01]
until it's done but the honest truth is

[03:08:59 - 03:09:04]
researchers do not know how LMS generate

[03:09:01 - 03:09:07]
their outputs because there are so many

[03:09:04 - 03:09:09]
layers um and there's so much going on

[03:09:07 - 03:09:10]
there that at this point right now the

[03:09:09 - 03:09:13]
level of complexity makes it very

[03:09:10 - 03:09:16]
difficult to truly understand how it is

[03:09:13 - 03:09:18]
reasoning its output um but it looks

[03:09:16 - 03:09:20]
like it's just doing word for word but

[03:09:18 - 03:09:22]
there is a bit more to it okay but there

[03:09:20 - 03:09:26]
you

[03:09:22 - 03:09:29]
[Music]

[03:09:26 - 03:09:30]
go the Transformer architecture was

[03:09:29 - 03:09:32]
developed by researchers at Google that

[03:09:30 - 03:09:35]
is effective at natural language

[03:09:32 - 03:09:38]
processing due to multi-head attention

[03:09:35 - 03:09:40]
and positional encoding and here is that

[03:09:38 - 03:09:42]
architecture it comes from that white

[03:09:40 - 03:09:45]
paper attention is all you need because

[03:09:42 - 03:09:47]
that is the special mechanism that it is

[03:09:45 - 03:09:50]
utilizing to pull off the Feats that it

[03:09:47 - 03:09:53]
is doing um I try to remember what came

[03:09:50 - 03:09:56]
before it it was like cnns and RN so

[03:09:53 - 03:09:58]
convolutional neural networks and uh

[03:09:56 - 03:10:01]
recurrence neural networks and

[03:09:58 - 03:10:05]
recurrence neural networks could kind of

[03:10:01 - 03:10:07]
do what Transformers do um but they just

[03:10:05 - 03:10:08]
had an issue with scaling and being able

[03:10:07 - 03:10:11]
to remember everything that they were

[03:10:08 - 03:10:13]
looking at and so this architecture

[03:10:11 - 03:10:16]
found a way to do that and that was with

[03:10:13 - 03:10:17]
positional encoding and multi head

[03:10:16 - 03:10:19]
attention how important important is it

[03:10:17 - 03:10:22]
to know this

[03:10:19 - 03:10:23]
architecture um it's good it's nice to

[03:10:22 - 03:10:26]
know so you get a bit of an experience

[03:10:23 - 03:10:29]
in terms of what's going on there but to

[03:10:26 - 03:10:31]
be honest working with um llms

[03:10:29 - 03:10:32]
constantly it's just like you kind of

[03:10:31 - 03:10:35]
forget about this and so it doesn't

[03:10:32 - 03:10:37]
really inform any of your workflows or

[03:10:35 - 03:10:39]
decisions I guess it's just more like by

[03:10:37 - 03:10:41]
looking at this uh you have more

[03:10:39 - 03:10:44]
confidence at reading white papers right

[03:10:41 - 03:10:45]
and and looking at some of the stuff of

[03:10:44 - 03:10:47]
these architectures so that's why we're

[03:10:45 - 03:10:48]
looking at it but Transformers

[03:10:47 - 03:10:50]
architectures are made up of two

[03:10:48 - 03:10:52]
components or two parts we have an

[03:10:50 - 03:10:54]
encoder and that's you get my pen tool

[03:10:52 - 03:10:56]
out here so it's very clear what we're

[03:10:54 - 03:10:59]
looking at but it's this thing here

[03:10:56 - 03:11:01]
right so that is uh our encoder I'm just

[03:10:59 - 03:11:03]
going to erase that there and so you can

[03:11:01 - 03:11:05]
get the idea that the one on the right

[03:11:03 - 03:11:07]
is going to be our decoder let's read

[03:11:05 - 03:11:09]
about what the encoder is so reads and

[03:11:07 - 03:11:11]
understands the input text it's like a

[03:11:09 - 03:11:13]
smart system that goes through

[03:11:11 - 03:11:15]
everything it's been taught and picks up

[03:11:13 - 03:11:17]
on the meanings of words and how they're

[03:11:15 - 03:11:19]
used in different context so that's the

[03:11:17 - 03:11:22]
high level and then the decoder based on

[03:11:19 - 03:11:24]
what the encoder has learned this part

[03:11:22 - 03:11:26]
generates New pieces of text it's like a

[03:11:24 - 03:11:29]
skilled writer that makes up sentences

[03:11:26 - 03:11:32]
that flow well and make sense and uh as

[03:11:29 - 03:11:33]
far as I understand that once you're uh

[03:11:32 - 03:11:36]
you put your data in here it comes

[03:11:33 - 03:11:37]
through here right uh and it has to be

[03:11:36 - 03:11:39]
already

[03:11:37 - 03:11:42]
embedded and then once it goes through

[03:11:39 - 03:11:45]
here it's uh it's going to Output uh

[03:11:42 - 03:11:48]
that um that stuff and it's going to go

[03:11:45 - 03:11:49]
into here and then each word as it

[03:11:48 - 03:11:50]
iterates through it's going to go

[03:11:49 - 03:11:53]
through here each word is going to go

[03:11:50 - 03:11:55]
here it's going to produce your sentence

[03:11:53 - 03:11:58]
with the next word and then it's going

[03:11:55 - 03:12:00]
to go all the way down here and then add

[03:11:58 - 03:12:02]
the next word and then feed all of this

[03:12:00 - 03:12:05]
back in and again and again and again so

[03:12:02 - 03:12:09]
it's just going to keep looping until it

[03:12:05 - 03:12:12]
runs out of um ability to write or it

[03:12:09 - 03:12:13]
decides to stop um and there are very

[03:12:12 - 03:12:15]
specific components that we're going to

[03:12:13 - 03:12:17]
look at the multi head attention in the

[03:12:15 - 03:12:19]
positional coding so we didn't really

[03:12:17 - 03:12:21]
describe them here but there they are

[03:12:19 - 03:12:23]
and you'll see them up close here in

[03:12:21 - 03:12:26]
just a moment

[03:12:23 - 03:12:29]
[Music]

[03:12:26 - 03:12:33]
okay so tokenization is the process of

[03:12:29 - 03:12:35]
breaking data input and in most cases

[03:12:33 - 03:12:37]
text into smaller parts so here on the

[03:12:35 - 03:12:39]
right hand side imagine you have a

[03:12:37 - 03:12:41]
string and you're going to break it up

[03:12:39 - 03:12:44]
into its parts uh which we represent as

[03:12:41 - 03:12:47]
an array here and then we're going to

[03:12:44 - 03:12:49]
give it a unique ID to the models VOC

[03:12:47 - 03:12:52]
vocabulary so when we're working with

[03:12:49 - 03:12:55]
llms you have to tokenize inputs and

[03:12:52 - 03:12:56]
depending on what llm you're using it's

[03:12:55 - 03:12:59]
going to use a different tokenization

[03:12:56 - 03:13:02]
algorithm so for example if you're using

[03:12:59 - 03:13:04]
GP uh gp3 you'd be using bite pair

[03:13:02 - 03:13:07]
encoding if you're using Bert you'd be

[03:13:04 - 03:13:10]
using word piece if you're using Google

[03:13:07 - 03:13:12]
T5 or or or GPT 3.5 you use sentence

[03:13:10 - 03:13:15]
piece you won't really notice this when

[03:13:12 - 03:13:17]
working with llms especially if you are

[03:13:15 - 03:13:19]
uh utilizing something like olama or

[03:13:17 - 03:13:22]
managed service because um these apis

[03:13:19 - 03:13:24]
are taking care of this um algorithm for

[03:13:22 - 03:13:27]
you so you just input it and it works

[03:13:24 - 03:13:30]
there but when you're working with um

[03:13:27 - 03:13:32]
llms the input text must be converted or

[03:13:30 - 03:13:34]
tokenized into sequence of tokens that

[03:13:32 - 03:13:36]
match the models internal vocabulary

[03:13:34 - 03:13:38]
what are we talking about when we say

[03:13:36 - 03:13:40]
internal vocabulary well when an llm is

[03:13:38 - 03:13:42]
trained it's creating an internal

[03:13:40 - 03:13:45]
vocabulary of tokens of all the stuff

[03:13:42 - 03:13:49]
that it knows right because if you

[03:13:45 - 03:13:51]
consume uh the the world's knowledge uh

[03:13:49 - 03:13:54]
you want to take all that knowledge that

[03:13:51 - 03:13:56]
text break it down into all its unique

[03:13:54 - 03:13:58]
components tokens and then assign a

[03:13:56 - 03:14:01]
value to it and so these large models

[03:13:58 - 03:14:03]
could have between 30 to 100,000 tokens

[03:14:01 - 03:14:06]
it could even be more than this or less

[03:14:03 - 03:14:08]
depending on your model but tokenization

[03:14:06 - 03:14:10]
is very important so that it understands

[03:14:08 - 03:14:11]
what's going on here there are some

[03:14:10 - 03:14:14]
things that we could talk about like

[03:14:11 - 03:14:16]
what happens when it uh uh encounters a

[03:14:14 - 03:14:18]
token it doesn't know but for the most

[03:14:16 - 03:14:20]
part

[03:14:18 - 03:14:21]
um this is tokenization that you need to

[03:14:20 - 03:14:25]
know

[03:14:21 - 03:14:27]
[Music]

[03:14:25 - 03:14:29]
okay let's talk about tokens and

[03:14:27 - 03:14:32]
capacity because it really matters um

[03:14:29 - 03:14:34]
about how much you can produce so when

[03:14:32 - 03:14:36]
using Transformers the decoder

[03:14:34 - 03:14:38]
continuously feeds the sequence of

[03:14:36 - 03:14:40]
tokens back in as the output to help

[03:14:38 - 03:14:43]
predict the next word in the input so

[03:14:40 - 03:14:46]
what are we talking about here so here

[03:14:43 - 03:14:48]
imagine we have our input as the quick

[03:14:46 - 03:14:51]
and so we we feed into the encoder the

[03:14:48 - 03:14:54]
encoder is going to produce um semantic

[03:14:51 - 03:14:56]
context so that the decoder knows what

[03:14:54 - 03:14:59]
to do with that text and then the

[03:14:56 - 03:15:01]
decoder is going to Output the next word

[03:14:59 - 03:15:04]
this is the quick brown and what it does

[03:15:01 - 03:15:06]
is it feeds that sequence of tokens back

[03:15:04 - 03:15:09]
into the decoder and produces the next

[03:15:06 - 03:15:12]
word and again and again and so the

[03:15:09 - 03:15:14]
question is what is the capacity

[03:15:12 - 03:15:17]
required to run this and so there are

[03:15:14 - 03:15:21]
two components that we care about memory

[03:15:17 - 03:15:23]
and compute so for memory each token in

[03:15:21 - 03:15:25]
a sequence requires memory so as the

[03:15:23 - 03:15:27]
token count increases the memory

[03:15:25 - 03:15:31]
increases the memory usage eventually

[03:15:27 - 03:15:35]
becomes exhausted and you cannot produce

[03:15:31 - 03:15:38]
anymore okay so now for compute models

[03:15:35 - 03:15:40]
uh a model performs more operations for

[03:15:38 - 03:15:44]
each additional token the longer the

[03:15:40 - 03:15:47]
sequence uh is is then the more compute

[03:15:44 - 03:15:49]
is required so a lot of AI servic that

[03:15:47 - 03:15:52]
offer modelss of service will often have

[03:15:49 - 03:15:55]
a limit a combined input and output

[03:15:52 - 03:15:57]
because it really has to do with the uh

[03:15:55 - 03:15:59]
the length of the sequence so if you

[03:15:57 - 03:16:01]
have a huge input then you're not going

[03:15:59 - 03:16:02]
to be able to generate a lot of words

[03:16:01 - 03:16:05]
because you're going to hit that uh

[03:16:02 - 03:16:08]
sequence token limit um a lot quicker so

[03:16:05 - 03:16:11]
hopefully that makes it very clear about

[03:16:08 - 03:16:16]
how memory and compute are uh inter time

[03:16:11 - 03:16:17]
with tokens um the way cost gets down is

[03:16:16 - 03:16:22]
you know they have to to figure out a

[03:16:17 - 03:16:24]
way of um reducing or making the model

[03:16:22 - 03:16:27]
more efficient so that's helping to

[03:16:24 - 03:16:28]
reduce the memory compute um there's

[03:16:27 - 03:16:30]
other things you can do so if you have a

[03:16:28 - 03:16:32]
conversation it gets too long what you

[03:16:30 - 03:16:34]
can do is summarize the

[03:16:32 - 03:16:37]
conversation um and feed it back into

[03:16:34 - 03:16:39]
there so it it doesn't exactly use all

[03:16:37 - 03:16:41]
of the context of what it had before but

[03:16:39 - 03:16:44]
it can do something similar and help

[03:16:41 - 03:16:49]
that conversation along okay

[03:16:44 - 03:16:51]
[Music]

[03:16:49 - 03:16:53]
so what are embeddings well before we

[03:16:51 - 03:16:55]
can answer that we need to answer what

[03:16:53 - 03:16:58]
is a vector so a vector is an arrow with

[03:16:55 - 03:17:00]
a length and Direction um that is the

[03:16:58 - 03:17:01]
simplest explanation if you're talking

[03:17:00 - 03:17:04]
to a mathematician they're going to have

[03:17:01 - 03:17:06]
a more fancier explanation but the

[03:17:04 - 03:17:10]
reason why this matters is that a vector

[03:17:06 - 03:17:12]
needs to exist in a vector space um and

[03:17:10 - 03:17:15]
so what is a vector space model it

[03:17:12 - 03:17:17]
represents text documents or other types

[03:17:15 - 03:17:19]
of data as vectors in a high dimensional

[03:17:17 - 03:17:22]
space so right now we're uh only looking

[03:17:19 - 03:17:26]
at a 2d axis but in reality this would

[03:17:22 - 03:17:29]
be in at least a 3D access but the idea

[03:17:26 - 03:17:31]
is that we have these documents and

[03:17:29 - 03:17:36]
these documents represent some form of

[03:17:31 - 03:17:39]
data and they are plotted onto our into

[03:17:36 - 03:17:43]
our Vector space uh with distances

[03:17:39 - 03:17:44]
between them okay and the thing is the

[03:17:43 - 03:17:46]
distance between these other documents

[03:17:44 - 03:17:48]
are going to correlate the relationship

[03:17:46 - 03:17:49]
with them so maybe these documents up

[03:17:48 - 03:17:51]
here I'm going to get my pen out here

[03:17:49 - 03:17:54]
maybe all these things have to do

[03:17:51 - 03:17:57]
something with um let's say vegetables

[03:17:54 - 03:18:00]
and these ones all have something to do

[03:17:57 - 03:18:03]
with um uh let's say meat and this is

[03:18:00 - 03:18:06]
dairy products over here so the way

[03:18:03 - 03:18:08]
these things are organized on the um in

[03:18:06 - 03:18:10]
the vector Space is really dependent on

[03:18:08 - 03:18:12]
the type of embedding you use so what

[03:18:10 - 03:18:15]
are embeddings these are vectors of data

[03:18:12 - 03:18:19]
used by ml models to find relationships

[03:18:15 - 03:18:20]
between data and you'll find that often

[03:18:19 - 03:18:22]
you're going to be using a machine

[03:18:20 - 03:18:23]
learning model to create embeddings and

[03:18:22 - 03:18:25]
there's

[03:18:23 - 03:18:27]
specialized um U machine learning models

[03:18:25 - 03:18:29]
just for embedding so you'll see

[03:18:27 - 03:18:31]
something like coh here which is a

[03:18:29 - 03:18:33]
company that produces um or creates

[03:18:31 - 03:18:35]
their own ml models they'll have like

[03:18:33 - 03:18:38]
command R but it'll be like command R

[03:18:35 - 03:18:41]
embeddings and what it does is it takes

[03:18:38 - 03:18:44]
an input and it outputs embeddings to be

[03:18:41 - 03:18:46]
placed into a vector store so different

[03:18:44 - 03:18:49]
embedding algorithms capture different

[03:18:46 - 03:18:52]
kinds of relationships and so it could

[03:18:49 - 03:18:55]
be the relationship could be uh

[03:18:52 - 03:18:57]
similarity in words in terms of the way

[03:18:55 - 03:18:59]
they are spelled or it could be the

[03:18:57 - 03:19:02]
length of a word uh or the the

[03:18:59 - 03:19:06]
relationship could be contextual which

[03:19:02 - 03:19:09]
is like um you know is is the

[03:19:06 - 03:19:11]
context uh related to a specific

[03:19:09 - 03:19:14]
industry or vertical so the embedding is

[03:19:11 - 03:19:18]
going to change uh the relationship that

[03:19:14 - 03:19:22]
is going to be um projected into that

[03:19:18 - 03:19:24]
Vector space and these um ml models that

[03:19:22 - 03:19:26]
produce embeddings are looking at not

[03:19:24 - 03:19:29]
just like a single relationship like

[03:19:26 - 03:19:31]
let's say length of word but multiple

[03:19:29 - 03:19:34]
relationships and correlating that to

[03:19:31 - 03:19:35]
put it into Vector space you can think

[03:19:34 - 03:19:37]
of embeddings as external memory for

[03:19:35 - 03:19:40]
performing a task for machine learning

[03:19:37 - 03:19:43]
models embeddings can be shared across

[03:19:40 - 03:19:46]
models which uh would give us a multi

[03:19:43 - 03:19:49]
model pattern to help coordinate a tasks

[03:19:46 - 03:19:50]
between between models but um yeah there

[03:19:49 - 03:19:54]
you

[03:19:50 - 03:19:57]
[Music]

[03:19:54 - 03:19:59]
go positional encoding is a technique

[03:19:57 - 03:20:01]
used to preserve order of words when

[03:19:59 - 03:20:03]
processing natural language Transformers

[03:20:01 - 03:20:05]
need positional encoders because they do

[03:20:03 - 03:20:07]
not process data sequentially and would

[03:20:05 - 03:20:09]
lose order of understanding when

[03:20:07 - 03:20:10]
analyzing large bodies of text the

[03:20:09 - 03:20:15]
precursor to

[03:20:10 - 03:20:17]
Transformers is um RNN so uh recurrence

[03:20:15 - 03:20:19]
neural networks they

[03:20:17 - 03:20:23]
operated in uh sequential order so they

[03:20:19 - 03:20:27]
could retain the order of words however

[03:20:23 - 03:20:30]
uh it made it hard to scale and to uh

[03:20:27 - 03:20:33]
remember a large amount of words uh to a

[03:20:30 - 03:20:36]
point so positional coding is a way to

[03:20:33 - 03:20:38]
fix that in the architectural diagram

[03:20:36 - 03:20:41]
for Transformers you'll see positional

[03:20:38 - 03:20:43]
en coding right after embeddings in this

[03:20:41 - 03:20:45]
architectural diagram here we have

[03:20:43 - 03:20:47]
positional codings up here so the idea

[03:20:45 - 03:20:49]
is we have our input it gets token ized

[03:20:47 - 03:20:51]
um turned into tokens then embedded into

[03:20:49 - 03:20:53]
embeddings it's going to go to the

[03:20:51 - 03:20:56]
positional encoding where it inserts

[03:20:53 - 03:21:00]
those uh points and then we're on to our

[03:20:56 - 03:21:02]
Transformer here okay but let's take a

[03:21:00 - 03:21:05]
look at the input a bit closer so

[03:21:02 - 03:21:06]
imagine you have each of those words or

[03:21:05 - 03:21:08]
those tokens you're going to give them a

[03:21:06 - 03:21:09]
positional vector and that's how it's

[03:21:08 - 03:21:11]
going to keep track of words as it's

[03:21:09 - 03:21:14]
getting mangled uh and interpreted

[03:21:11 - 03:21:16]
through the whole architectural uh

[03:21:14 - 03:21:20]
diagram okay

[03:21:16 - 03:21:23]
[Music]

[03:21:20 - 03:21:25]
let's take a look at attention so

[03:21:23 - 03:21:28]
attention figures out how each word or

[03:21:25 - 03:21:30]
token in a sequence is important to

[03:21:28 - 03:21:32]
other words within that sequence by

[03:21:30 - 03:21:35]
assigning them word weights or token

[03:21:32 - 03:21:37]
weights or attention weights if you will

[03:21:35 - 03:21:39]
um so I want to talk about three types

[03:21:37 - 03:21:41]
of attention we have self attention

[03:21:39 - 03:21:43]
cross attention and multi-head attension

[03:21:41 - 03:21:44]
and some of these are combined you'll

[03:21:43 - 03:21:46]
see that in a

[03:21:44 - 03:21:48]
moment but let's talk about the first

[03:21:46 - 03:21:50]
one self attention computes attention

[03:21:48 - 03:21:53]
weights within the same input sequence

[03:21:50 - 03:21:55]
where each element attends to all other

[03:21:53 - 03:21:57]
elements and when you see this it

[03:21:55 - 03:22:00]
basically means that as attention

[03:21:57 - 03:22:02]
happens it keeps feeding uh itself right

[03:22:00 - 03:22:04]
back into itself the same sequence so

[03:22:02 - 03:22:06]
used in Transformers to model

[03:22:04 - 03:22:08]
relationships and sequences so words in

[03:22:06 - 03:22:10]
a sequence you have cross attention

[03:22:08 - 03:22:12]
computes attension weights between two

[03:22:10 - 03:22:15]
different sequences allowing one

[03:22:12 - 03:22:17]
sequence to attend to another sequence

[03:22:15 - 03:22:19]
this is used in TAS like translation

[03:22:17 - 03:22:23]
where the output sequence decoder needs

[03:22:19 - 03:22:25]
to focus on the input sequence encoder

[03:22:23 - 03:22:26]
we have multi-ad attention so combine

[03:22:25 - 03:22:29]
multiple self attention or cross

[03:22:26 - 03:22:32]
attention heads in parallel each

[03:22:29 - 03:22:34]
focusing on different aspects of the

[03:22:32 - 03:22:36]
input um so useing Transformers to

[03:22:34 - 03:22:38]
improve performance and capture various

[03:22:36 - 03:22:41]
dependencies simultaneously so how can

[03:22:38 - 03:22:44]
we look at this in a practical way for

[03:22:41 - 03:22:47]
our uh architecture for the Transformers

[03:22:44 - 03:22:49]
so here you can see that in blue it says

[03:22:47 - 03:22:51]
multi-headed self attention it's

[03:22:49 - 03:22:53]
multi-headed because it's receiving

[03:22:51 - 03:22:58]
multiple inputs you see

[03:22:53 - 03:23:00]
VK uh q and um I believe that the Q is

[03:22:58 - 03:23:02]
like for query key is for key and V is

[03:23:00 - 03:23:04]
for Value it has something to do with

[03:23:02 - 03:23:05]
like how search engines think kind of

[03:23:04 - 03:23:08]
like if you were if you were to let's

[03:23:05 - 03:23:10]
say use YouTube and you were to type in

[03:23:08 - 03:23:12]
a query there it would match to Keys

[03:23:10 - 03:23:15]
which would then return you back a value

[03:23:12 - 03:23:16]
so that is the best description I can

[03:23:15 - 03:23:19]
give for it it's self attention because

[03:23:16 - 03:23:23]
it feeds back its own sequence it's

[03:23:19 - 03:23:26]
going to be the same back and forth um

[03:23:23 - 03:23:28]
there on the other side we have

[03:23:26 - 03:23:30]
multiheaded uh cross attention so it's

[03:23:28 - 03:23:33]
multi-headed because it's receiving

[03:23:30 - 03:23:35]
multiple inputs so we have the vkq but

[03:23:33 - 03:23:38]
it's cross attention because it feeds

[03:23:35 - 03:23:40]
sequences uh sequence inputs from two

[03:23:38 - 03:23:42]
different sources remember it says that

[03:23:40 - 03:23:45]
um cross detentions two different

[03:23:42 - 03:23:47]
sequences well we have V and K coming

[03:23:45 - 03:23:48]
from the encoder and then we have q

[03:23:47 - 03:23:50]
which is actually coming from the

[03:23:48 - 03:23:52]
decoder so it's cut off here but the

[03:23:50 - 03:23:55]
idea is that the decoder is feeding

[03:23:52 - 03:23:58]
itself right back into itself and it

[03:23:55 - 03:24:00]
goes through here into this uh one here

[03:23:58 - 03:24:04]
and then we get the que and it goes

[03:24:00 - 03:24:07]
right there okay so again it's not super

[03:24:04 - 03:24:09]
important to remember this stuff it's

[03:24:07 - 03:24:11]
just to get you a bit of exposure to

[03:24:09 - 03:24:14]
looking at these architectural diagrams

[03:24:11 - 03:24:17]
and to see that there is a way to

[03:24:14 - 03:24:19]
understand them uh but they can get very

[03:24:17 - 03:24:21]
involved and it might be very hard to

[03:24:19 - 03:24:24]
retain that information unless you are

[03:24:21 - 03:24:26]
um actually very invested in

[03:24:24 - 03:24:30]
understanding and building these things

[03:24:26 - 03:24:33]
[Music]

[03:24:30 - 03:24:35]
okay when we're talking about large

[03:24:33 - 03:24:37]
language models there's this idea of

[03:24:35 - 03:24:38]
fine-tuning where if we have a model

[03:24:37 - 03:24:40]
that we don't like it we can do

[03:24:38 - 03:24:42]
something to it to make it work a little

[03:24:40 - 03:24:43]
bit better to understand fine tuning and

[03:24:42 - 03:24:45]
the ways we can fine tune it let's just

[03:24:43 - 03:24:46]
talk about the components that that are

[03:24:45 - 03:24:48]
involved in fine tuning

[03:24:46 - 03:24:51]
and so we have to first take a look at

[03:24:48 - 03:24:55]
Hidden layers and its components so when

[03:24:51 - 03:24:57]
training you have layers of nodes also

[03:24:55 - 03:24:59]
called neurons so think like your brain

[03:24:57 - 03:25:01]
and between these nodes there are going

[03:24:59 - 03:25:05]
to be connections and so connections are

[03:25:01 - 03:25:07]
often between or cross layers um but

[03:25:05 - 03:25:09]
connections can also be within the same

[03:25:07 - 03:25:10]
layer and that's where we get this

[03:25:09 - 03:25:12]
concept of self attention if you

[03:25:10 - 03:25:13]
remember the concept of attention is

[03:25:12 - 03:25:15]
really important when we're talking

[03:25:13 - 03:25:17]
about Transformers for large language

[03:25:15 - 03:25:19]
models and and I mean if we represent it

[03:25:17 - 03:25:21]
it'd be more like it's connecting back

[03:25:19 - 03:25:23]
to itself and that's why we call it self

[03:25:21 - 03:25:25]
attention because it's a layer that

[03:25:23 - 03:25:28]
feeds back into itself uh which is self

[03:25:25 - 03:25:30]
attention Okay but connections could

[03:25:28 - 03:25:33]
also uh be where we have multiple sets

[03:25:30 - 03:25:34]
of hidden layers uh and these

[03:25:33 - 03:25:36]
connections are computed in parallel so

[03:25:34 - 03:25:37]
the idea I'm going to just draw this

[03:25:36 - 03:25:38]
here but imagine we have another layer

[03:25:37 - 03:25:41]
with

[03:25:38 - 03:25:43]
nodes right and the idea is that this

[03:25:41 - 03:25:45]
one will feed into that one but this

[03:25:43 - 03:25:47]
one's coming from here and so now we

[03:25:45 - 03:25:49]
it's called multi- head attention

[03:25:47 - 03:25:50]
because it's coming from multiple

[03:25:49 - 03:25:52]
sources and in fact some of these

[03:25:50 - 03:25:56]
they'll come all the way back here and

[03:25:52 - 03:26:00]
go like this and and feed in so you know

[03:25:56 - 03:26:03]
that is ways that we can uh feed our

[03:26:00 - 03:26:05]
data forward uh then we have parameters

[03:26:03 - 03:26:08]
so parameters are the weights of

[03:26:05 - 03:26:09]
connections so um over here on the right

[03:26:08 - 03:26:12]
hand side get my pen tool out again we

[03:26:09 - 03:26:13]
have a weight and this weight is the

[03:26:12 - 03:26:16]
representation of this connection

[03:26:13 - 03:26:19]
between these two nodes and so that's

[03:26:16 - 03:26:21]
going to be a value and so a connection

[03:26:19 - 03:26:23]
might have one parameter but they can

[03:26:21 - 03:26:25]
also have multiple parameters most cases

[03:26:23 - 03:26:27]
it's one parameter but you can imagine

[03:26:25 - 03:26:28]
that for the amount of nodes that you

[03:26:27 - 03:26:30]
have in each layer they're going to have

[03:26:28 - 03:26:32]
to connect to all the other ones in the

[03:26:30 - 03:26:34]
next layer and that's going to add up

[03:26:32 - 03:26:37]
really quickly let's take a look at some

[03:26:34 - 03:26:39]
um uh Transformer models or large

[03:26:37 - 03:26:43]
language models and understand how many

[03:26:39 - 03:26:44]
layers they're utilizing for training to

[03:26:43 - 03:26:48]
get perspective so let's take a look at

[03:26:44 - 03:26:49]
gpt3 so gpt3 is not new um in fact it is

[03:26:48 - 03:26:52]
one of the smaller models that you can

[03:26:49 - 03:26:55]
train still um like babage or Da Vinci

[03:26:52 - 03:26:56]
if you go like let's say use Microsoft

[03:26:55 - 03:26:59]
um Azure AI studio and you want to do

[03:26:56 - 03:27:04]
fine tuning you can train gpt3 models

[03:26:59 - 03:27:05]
and it has 96 layers or it's large uh uh

[03:27:04 - 03:27:08]
if we think about its parameters that's

[03:27:05 - 03:27:11]
175 billion parameters so you can only

[03:27:08 - 03:27:12]
imagine how many uh nodes or connections

[03:27:11 - 03:27:15]
are going on in there but that's how

[03:27:12 - 03:27:18]
many there are um and then we have Bert

[03:27:15 - 03:27:21]
so Bert has 12 layers or up to 24 layers

[03:27:18 - 03:27:24]
so Bert is uh still useful it's a um a

[03:27:21 - 03:27:26]
much simpler uh Transformer that we can

[03:27:24 - 03:27:29]
utilize we have gpt2 which has between

[03:27:26 - 03:27:32]
12 to 48 layers so the same or more as

[03:27:29 - 03:27:36]
Bert then you have Google's T5 which has

[03:27:32 - 03:27:39]
12 encoder and 12 decoder layers or up

[03:27:36 - 03:27:40]
to 24 layers there so you know we're

[03:27:39 - 03:27:42]
talking about fine tuni it's going to be

[03:27:40 - 03:27:46]
tweaking the amount of

[03:27:42 - 03:27:48]
layers uh the the the the ount of

[03:27:46 - 03:27:50]
connections we're going to train and

[03:27:48 - 03:27:52]
things like that but let's go Define

[03:27:50 - 03:27:55]
what is fine tuning so fine tuning is

[03:27:52 - 03:27:58]
retraining a pre-trained models weights

[03:27:55 - 03:28:01]
or its parameters on a smaller data set

[03:27:58 - 03:28:03]
so a model's weights is the outputed

[03:28:01 - 03:28:04]
state of a model but in this case when

[03:28:03 - 03:28:07]
we're talking about fine-tuning we're

[03:28:04 - 03:28:09]
talking about a trained models output

[03:28:07 - 03:28:11]
okay so then what is supervised

[03:28:09 - 03:28:13]
fine-tuning sftt this is where when we

[03:28:11 - 03:28:17]
provide the data set it's already been

[03:28:13 - 03:28:20]
labeled right so imagine we have have um

[03:28:17 - 03:28:22]
a bunch of cats uh or like photos of

[03:28:20 - 03:28:26]
animals and so we're labeling what each

[03:28:22 - 03:28:27]
animal is so that when the um the model

[03:28:26 - 03:28:29]
is training it's like it has a cheat

[03:28:27 - 03:28:32]
sheet to know how to understand exactly

[03:28:29 - 03:28:33]
what it is that it has okay but so we're

[03:28:32 - 03:28:35]
basically explicitly telling the model

[03:28:33 - 03:28:37]
what the data is as opposed to when we

[03:28:35 - 03:28:39]
train our base model that might be

[03:28:37 - 03:28:40]
unsupervised uh where we're not saying

[03:28:39 - 03:28:43]
oh this is what this is right because

[03:28:40 - 03:28:45]
we're giving lot imagine trying to do

[03:28:43 - 03:28:47]
supervised training on a huge data set

[03:28:45 - 03:28:50]
like labeling all that would be very

[03:28:47 - 03:28:53]
difficult so the idea is that um we will

[03:28:50 - 03:28:55]
produce our base model uh first or in

[03:28:53 - 03:28:57]
the case of LM the base model is the

[03:28:55 - 03:29:00]
foundational model so you're taking an

[03:28:57 - 03:29:02]
existing Model A A A foundational model

[03:29:00 - 03:29:04]
and then we're going to train it as soon

[03:29:02 - 03:29:06]
as we have a foundational model or base

[03:29:04 - 03:29:09]
model and we decide to find tun it now

[03:29:06 - 03:29:11]
it's being called a pre-trained model

[03:29:09 - 03:29:15]
okay so understand those terms we have

[03:29:11 - 03:29:17]
FM okay base model pre-trained model

[03:29:15 - 03:29:19]
they're all the same area they don't

[03:29:17 - 03:29:20]
necessarily mean exactly the same thing

[03:29:19 - 03:29:23]
but they represent the same thing at

[03:29:20 - 03:29:25]
this place in time so we're get ready to

[03:29:23 - 03:29:27]
take our base model and fine tune it so

[03:29:25 - 03:29:29]
we're going to bring in our smaller data

[03:29:27 - 03:29:32]
set I'm just going to uh clear all the

[03:29:29 - 03:29:34]
ink off the screen here and so the idea

[03:29:32 - 03:29:37]
here is that um we're bring in that data

[03:29:34 - 03:29:40]
set and now we're going to train it

[03:29:37 - 03:29:42]
retrain it uh and produce our fine to

[03:29:40 - 03:29:43]
model now when I say we're producing

[03:29:42 - 03:29:44]
these models or we're outputting these

[03:29:43 - 03:29:47]
models we're not actually outputting

[03:29:44 - 03:29:49]
models we're outputting the model's

[03:29:47 - 03:29:51]
weights okay we're not creating new

[03:29:49 - 03:29:54]
models we're just uh creating new

[03:29:51 - 03:29:57]
outputed states of the model um and just

[03:29:54 - 03:29:58]
understand that that is it often sounds

[03:29:57 - 03:30:00]
like we're creating new code or

[03:29:58 - 03:30:03]
something but that's not necessarily

[03:30:00 - 03:30:04]
true so let's now talk about the types

[03:30:03 - 03:30:06]
of fine tuning we can do because there's

[03:30:04 - 03:30:09]
a lot of approaches we can take to fine

[03:30:06 - 03:30:11]
tuning um so and this is not even

[03:30:09 - 03:30:13]
exhausted but the first let's talk about

[03:30:11 - 03:30:15]
changing the data set so the data set

[03:30:13 - 03:30:17]
itself the data you're going to put in

[03:30:15 - 03:30:18]
there we could do instruction fine

[03:30:17 - 03:30:23]
tuning that's where we take a data set

[03:30:18 - 03:30:25]
and we tell exactly what we want as uh

[03:30:23 - 03:30:26]
like let's say we say I say this you do

[03:30:25 - 03:30:29]
that so you're giving an example of what

[03:30:26 - 03:30:31]
a person says and what the outcome is so

[03:30:29 - 03:30:32]
that's instruction fine tuning uh then

[03:30:31 - 03:30:35]
we have domain specific fine-tuning

[03:30:32 - 03:30:37]
that's where you're taking uh a knowled

[03:30:35 - 03:30:40]
a knowledge base or a data set of

[03:30:37 - 03:30:43]
specific knowledge to update the model

[03:30:40 - 03:30:45]
on that knowledge or to make it uh focus

[03:30:43 - 03:30:47]
more on that knowledge set right so if

[03:30:45 - 03:30:48]
we had a generic LM and we wanted to

[03:30:47 - 03:30:51]
make it specifically for learning cloud

[03:30:48 - 03:30:53]
computing I could load it up with the

[03:30:51 - 03:30:56]
most upto-date

[03:30:53 - 03:30:59]
um uh cloud data or even my own stuff to

[03:30:56 - 03:31:00]
make it teach like I would teach okay

[03:30:59 - 03:31:02]
then we have changing the method of

[03:31:00 - 03:31:04]
training so we have full fine tuning

[03:31:02 - 03:31:06]
this is where all the models weights are

[03:31:04 - 03:31:08]
updated and it's expensive so you say

[03:31:06 - 03:31:09]
full fine tuning we can just think of it

[03:31:08 - 03:31:13]
as traditional fine tuning it you're

[03:31:09 - 03:31:16]
basically taking the existing existing

[03:31:13 - 03:31:18]
model models weights like after the the

[03:31:16 - 03:31:20]
base tune as the starting point and

[03:31:18 - 03:31:22]
running it through the training process

[03:31:20 - 03:31:24]
again now you can add these two things

[03:31:22 - 03:31:26]
together right you can um do full fine

[03:31:24 - 03:31:29]
tuning and change the data set they're

[03:31:26 - 03:31:31]
they're uh they're they can be done

[03:31:29 - 03:31:33]
together or both separately it's up to

[03:31:31 - 03:31:36]
you we have parameter efficient fine

[03:31:33 - 03:31:38]
tuning so also known as PFT you'll see

[03:31:36 - 03:31:40]
this term come up a lot uh it only

[03:31:38 - 03:31:41]
updates a small set of parameters during

[03:31:40 - 03:31:44]
the training and freezes the rest of the

[03:31:41 - 03:31:45]
parameters there is a subset of PF

[03:31:44 - 03:31:46]
called Laura which we're not going to

[03:31:45 - 03:31:49]
talk too much about here but I'm just

[03:31:46 - 03:31:51]
going to get you exposure to this if you

[03:31:49 - 03:31:52]
are not needing to update every sing

[03:31:51 - 03:31:55]
Single parameter then you're going to

[03:31:52 - 03:31:58]
save money there another way is uh last

[03:31:55 - 03:32:01]
layer fine tuning this is where you will

[03:31:58 - 03:32:03]
freeze all the layers except the last

[03:32:01 - 03:32:05]
layer and when we say freeze we just

[03:32:03 - 03:32:06]
mean we're saving the state at that

[03:32:05 - 03:32:08]
point in time right or we're telling it

[03:32:06 - 03:32:10]
to skip until it gets to the last step

[03:32:08 - 03:32:13]
um and then we're basically just train

[03:32:10 - 03:32:15]
it on a single layer and apparently that

[03:32:13 - 03:32:16]
works really well so there's a lot of

[03:32:15 - 03:32:18]
things that we can another thing we can

[03:32:16 - 03:32:22]
do is we can do pruning so this is where

[03:32:18 - 03:32:23]
you're removing parameters all right and

[03:32:22 - 03:32:25]
people might want to do this just to

[03:32:23 - 03:32:27]
make the model smaller and more

[03:32:25 - 03:32:29]
efficient because um maybe we can remove

[03:32:27 - 03:32:33]
parameters and it will uh use less

[03:32:29 - 03:32:35]
compute or be faster um for some

[03:32:33 - 03:32:37]
trade-offs and there's two ways we can

[03:32:35 - 03:32:39]
do this time train time pruning so

[03:32:37 - 03:32:41]
somehow we are making the model to

[03:32:39 - 03:32:43]
encourage to drop or remove connections

[03:32:41 - 03:32:45]
or neurons during training or post

[03:32:43 - 03:32:47]
training pruning which is basically you

[03:32:45 - 03:32:49]
mangling the the model weights file the

[03:32:47 - 03:32:54]
the file that's outputed so yeah a lot

[03:32:49 - 03:32:54]
of options here but uh there you

[03:32:54 - 03:33:01]
[Music]

[03:32:58 - 03:33:03]
go let's take a look at labeling so data

[03:33:01 - 03:33:05]
labeling is the process of identifying

[03:33:03 - 03:33:07]
raw data images text files videos and

[03:33:05 - 03:33:09]
adding one or me more meaningful and

[03:33:07 - 03:33:11]
informative labels to provide context so

[03:33:09 - 03:33:13]
machine learning model can learn from

[03:33:11 - 03:33:14]
with supervised Lear uh machine learning

[03:33:13 - 03:33:16]
Lael is a prerequisite to produce

[03:33:14 - 03:33:18]
training data and piece of data will

[03:33:16 - 03:33:21]
generally be labeled by human on left

[03:33:18 - 03:33:23]
hand side that's an example of um Amazon

[03:33:21 - 03:33:25]
recognition where it's trying to

[03:33:23 - 03:33:27]
identify bounding boxes or classifying

[03:33:25 - 03:33:28]
image under particular categories that's

[03:33:27 - 03:33:31]
an example of supervised machine

[03:33:28 - 03:33:33]
learning that requires label data with

[03:33:31 - 03:33:35]
unsupervised machine learning labels

[03:33:33 - 03:33:38]
will be uh produced by the machine and

[03:33:35 - 03:33:41]
may not be human readable then there's

[03:33:38 - 03:33:43]
this concept of ground truth this is a

[03:33:41 - 03:33:45]
uh a properly labeled data set that you

[03:33:43 - 03:33:48]
use as an objective standard to train an

[03:33:45 - 03:33:50]
assess a given model and is often called

[03:33:48 - 03:33:52]
Ground truth the accuracy of train

[03:33:50 - 03:33:54]
models will depend on the accuracy of

[03:33:52 - 03:33:57]
your ground truth and so ground to data

[03:33:54 - 03:33:59]
is very important uh for uh you know

[03:33:57 - 03:34:03]
successful models

[03:33:59 - 03:34:05]
[Music]

[03:34:03 - 03:34:06]
okay let's take a look here at data

[03:34:05 - 03:34:07]
mining this is the extraction of

[03:34:06 - 03:34:09]
patterns and knowledge from large

[03:34:07 - 03:34:12]
amounts of data not the extraction of

[03:34:09 - 03:34:14]
data itself and so the industry has this

[03:34:12 - 03:34:16]
thing called Chris DM which defines it

[03:34:14 - 03:34:18]
in six phases verus business

[03:34:16 - 03:34:21]
understanding so what does the business

[03:34:18 - 03:34:24]
need data understanding what do we have

[03:34:21 - 03:34:26]
and what data do we have we have data

[03:34:24 - 03:34:29]
preparation so how do we organize the

[03:34:26 - 03:34:31]
data for modeling the modeling which is

[03:34:29 - 03:34:34]
what modeling Tech techniques should we

[03:34:31 - 03:34:37]
apply evaluation what data model best

[03:34:34 - 03:34:39]
meets the business objectives deployment

[03:34:37 - 03:34:41]
how do be people access the data so that

[03:34:39 - 03:34:45]
gives you an idea about working with

[03:34:41 - 03:34:45]
data mining okay

[03:34:46 - 03:34:48]
[Music]

[03:34:47 - 03:34:51]
let's take a look here at data mining

[03:34:48 - 03:34:53]
methods um these are ways that we find

[03:34:51 - 03:34:54]
valid patterns and relationships in huge

[03:34:53 - 03:34:55]
data sets and they're important when

[03:34:54 - 03:34:57]
we're talking about machine learning

[03:34:55 - 03:35:00]
because sometimes that is what the model

[03:34:57 - 03:35:01]
is trying to do it's trying to find a

[03:35:00 - 03:35:03]
pattern of relationship it's trying to

[03:35:01 - 03:35:04]
predict that so I'm not going to read

[03:35:03 - 03:35:06]
through all this because you can read

[03:35:04 - 03:35:07]
through it if you want but these are

[03:35:06 - 03:35:09]
terms that we've seen already like

[03:35:07 - 03:35:12]
classification clustering regression

[03:35:09 - 03:35:14]
sequential Association rules outer

[03:35:12 - 03:35:16]
detection and prediction uh and notice

[03:35:14 - 03:35:18]
down here when we have prediction it

[03:35:16 - 03:35:19]
says uh use a combination of other data

[03:35:18 - 03:35:21]
mining techniques such as Trends

[03:35:19 - 03:35:23]
clustering classification to predict

[03:35:21 - 03:35:25]
future data which is fine but we have

[03:35:23 - 03:35:27]
classification clustering regression and

[03:35:25 - 03:35:31]
Association these four are going to show

[03:35:27 - 03:35:34]
up again and again when we're looking at

[03:35:31 - 03:35:35]
um classical models okay so machine

[03:35:34 - 03:35:37]
learning models but anyway I just wanted

[03:35:35 - 03:35:39]
to include that even though this is more

[03:35:37 - 03:35:43]
of a data a data slide

[03:35:39 - 03:35:45]
[Music]

[03:35:43 - 03:35:47]
okay let's take a look here at knowledge

[03:35:45 - 03:35:49]
mining this is a discipline in AI that

[03:35:47 - 03:35:51]
uses combination of intelligent services

[03:35:49 - 03:35:53]
to quickly learn from vast amounts of

[03:35:51 - 03:35:55]
information it allows organizations to

[03:35:53 - 03:35:57]
deeply understand and easily explore

[03:35:55 - 03:35:59]
information uncover hidden insights and

[03:35:57 - 03:36:01]
find relationships and patterns at scale

[03:35:59 - 03:36:03]
this is a term that was kind of coined

[03:36:01 - 03:36:06]
over at Microsoft you don't hear about

[03:36:03 - 03:36:09]
it over at Azure or gcp but it still is

[03:36:06 - 03:36:11]
a good uh concept to know the other

[03:36:09 - 03:36:13]
thing is that when we look at rag so

[03:36:11 - 03:36:15]
that's retrieval augmented generation

[03:36:13 - 03:36:17]
there is a lot of overlap with this or

[03:36:15 - 03:36:20]
in many cases you can look at rag being

[03:36:17 - 03:36:21]
knowledge mining um but let's talk about

[03:36:20 - 03:36:24]
what we have here so the first thing is

[03:36:21 - 03:36:27]
inest then we have enrich and we have

[03:36:24 - 03:36:29]
explore so inest is inest content from a

[03:36:27 - 03:36:31]
range of sources using connectors to fir

[03:36:29 - 03:36:32]
uh uh to first and third party data

[03:36:31 - 03:36:35]
stores so we have structured data like

[03:36:32 - 03:36:38]
databases csvs unstructured data like

[03:36:35 - 03:36:40]
PDF video images and audio we have

[03:36:38 - 03:36:41]
enrich so enrich the content with AI

[03:36:40 - 03:36:43]
capabilities and let you extract

[03:36:41 - 03:36:45]
information find patterns and deep

[03:36:43 - 03:36:47]
deepening understanding so for managing

[03:36:45 - 03:36:49]
I service we have Vision Services

[03:36:47 - 03:36:52]
language Services speech services

[03:36:49 - 03:36:56]
decision services and search Services

[03:36:52 - 03:36:57]
now those literally ma to Azure uh AI

[03:36:56 - 03:36:59]
managed services but we're talking about

[03:36:57 - 03:37:01]
AWS uh when we're talking about Vision

[03:36:59 - 03:37:04]
we're talking about recognition we're

[03:37:01 - 03:37:06]
talking about language um I guess that

[03:37:04 - 03:37:08]
could be something like um I'm trying to

[03:37:06 - 03:37:10]
remember the service that does NLP here

[03:37:08 - 03:37:13]
uh I can't remember off the top of my

[03:37:10 - 03:37:16]
head but for speech we have paully um

[03:37:13 - 03:37:18]
for for search this could be

[03:37:16 - 03:37:20]
not necessarily an AI well it could be

[03:37:18 - 03:37:21]
Kendra right so there's a lot of managi

[03:37:20 - 03:37:23]
services that can be utilized at that

[03:37:21 - 03:37:26]
level then we have explor so the newly

[03:37:23 - 03:37:27]
index data via search Bots or existing

[03:37:26 - 03:37:30]
business applications and data

[03:37:27 - 03:37:32]
visualizations so here it could be used

[03:37:30 - 03:37:34]
in a CRM it could be in a wrap system it

[03:37:32 - 03:37:36]
could be powerbi and I didn't list it

[03:37:34 - 03:37:38]
here but it could also be used to return

[03:37:36 - 03:37:41]
back to an llm to interpret and then

[03:37:38 - 03:37:44]
complete rag so there you

[03:37:41 - 03:37:46]
[Music]

[03:37:44 - 03:37:48]
go let's take a look here at data

[03:37:46 - 03:37:50]
wrangling this is the process of

[03:37:48 - 03:37:52]
transforming mapping data from one raw

[03:37:50 - 03:37:54]
data form into another format with the

[03:37:52 - 03:37:57]
intent of making it more appropriate and

[03:37:54 - 03:37:59]
valuable uh for a variety of Downstream

[03:37:57 - 03:38:02]
purposes such as analytics also known as

[03:37:59 - 03:38:03]
data Ming I don't know who comes up with

[03:38:02 - 03:38:05]
all these terms they're crazy but there

[03:38:03 - 03:38:08]
are six core steps behind data wrangling

[03:38:05 - 03:38:10]
the first is Discovery so understand

[03:38:08 - 03:38:12]
what your data is about and keep in mind

[03:38:10 - 03:38:14]
domain specific details about your data

[03:38:12 - 03:38:15]
As you move through other steps

[03:38:14 - 03:38:18]
structuring you need to organize your

[03:38:15 - 03:38:20]
content into a structure that will be

[03:38:18 - 03:38:23]
easier to work for uh in your end

[03:38:20 - 03:38:25]
results cleaning remove outliers change

[03:38:23 - 03:38:27]
null values remove duplicates remove

[03:38:25 - 03:38:29]
special character standardized

[03:38:27 - 03:38:32]
formatting enriching so appending or

[03:38:29 - 03:38:34]
enhancing collected data with relevant

[03:38:32 - 03:38:36]
context obtained from additional sources

[03:38:34 - 03:38:39]
validating so authenticating the

[03:38:36 - 03:38:41]
reliability quality sa uh safety of data

[03:38:39 - 03:38:43]
publishing so place your data in a data

[03:38:41 - 03:38:45]
store so you can use it Downstream when

[03:38:43 - 03:38:46]
we're talking about adabs specifically

[03:38:45 - 03:38:49]
when we're talking about data wrangling

[03:38:46 - 03:38:53]
there is um Sage maker data Wrangler and

[03:38:49 - 03:38:54]
then there's uh ads glue data Brew um

[03:38:53 - 03:38:56]
and there's that that concept of

[03:38:54 - 03:38:58]
knowledge mining that we we said that

[03:38:56 - 03:39:01]
was more of an Azure concept but you can

[03:38:58 - 03:39:05]
apply to ads where you could use uh

[03:39:01 - 03:39:08]
managed AI uh iTab services to enrich

[03:39:05 - 03:39:10]
your data but anyway this is the concept

[03:39:08 - 03:39:12]
of data wrangling it's basically the way

[03:39:10 - 03:39:14]
I think of it is just pre-processing or

[03:39:12 - 03:39:16]
cleaning your data for use for your ml

[03:39:14 - 03:39:19]
models but there you

[03:39:16 - 03:39:21]
[Music]

[03:39:19 - 03:39:23]
go let's take a look here at what is

[03:39:21 - 03:39:26]
data modeling and so let's answer what

[03:39:23 - 03:39:27]
is a data model this is an abstract

[03:39:26 - 03:39:29]
model that organizes elements of data

[03:39:27 - 03:39:31]
and standardizes how they relate to one

[03:39:29 - 03:39:33]
another and the properties of the real

[03:39:31 - 03:39:35]
world entities a data model can be a

[03:39:33 - 03:39:36]
relational database that contains many

[03:39:35 - 03:39:39]
tables as the example here on the right

[03:39:36 - 03:39:41]
hand side a data model could be

[03:39:39 - 03:39:43]
conceptual so how data is represented at

[03:39:41 - 03:39:47]
the organization level abstractly

[03:39:43 - 03:39:49]
without uh concretely defining how it

[03:39:47 - 03:39:52]
works in the software so I think people

[03:39:49 - 03:39:54]
orders projects relationships it could

[03:39:52 - 03:39:56]
be logical so how data is presented in

[03:39:54 - 03:39:59]
software so tables and columns object

[03:39:56 - 03:40:01]
oriented classes physical so how data is

[03:39:59 - 03:40:04]
physically stored such as partitions

[03:40:01 - 03:40:07]
CPUs and table spaces we had another

[03:40:04 - 03:40:08]
definition for what a model was when we

[03:40:07 - 03:40:09]
were trying to describe what machine

[03:40:08 - 03:40:11]
learning models are but I'm just giving

[03:40:09 - 03:40:15]
you another perspective from a data

[03:40:11 - 03:40:17]
perspective of uh what that could be so

[03:40:15 - 03:40:19]
what is data modeling so this is the

[03:40:17 - 03:40:20]
process used to define and analyze data

[03:40:19 - 03:40:22]
requirements needed to support the

[03:40:20 - 03:40:24]
business processes within the scope of

[03:40:22 - 03:40:27]
corresponding information systems and

[03:40:24 - 03:40:30]
organizations and so there is this uh

[03:40:27 - 03:40:32]
very uh complex uh uh diagram here that

[03:40:30 - 03:40:36]
kind of shows you uh what data modeling

[03:40:32 - 03:40:40]
could look like but uh yeah there you go

[03:40:36 - 03:40:42]
[Music]

[03:40:40 - 03:40:44]
okay let's take a look at data analytics

[03:40:42 - 03:40:45]
data analytics is concerned with

[03:40:44 - 03:40:47]
examining transforming and ranging data

[03:40:45 - 03:40:49]
so you can extract and study useful

[03:40:47 - 03:40:52]
information a data analyst commonly uses

[03:40:49 - 03:40:53]
SQL bi tools and spreadsheets and so the

[03:40:52 - 03:40:55]
workflow would look something like this

[03:40:53 - 03:40:58]
data ingestion data cleaning and

[03:40:55 - 03:41:01]
transformation dimensionality reduction

[03:40:58 - 03:41:04]
data analysis visualization it's really

[03:41:01 - 03:41:05]
important to understand data stuff if

[03:41:04 - 03:41:08]
you want to work with machine learning

[03:41:05 - 03:41:11]
because machine learning is just

[03:41:08 - 03:41:13]
algorithms complex algorithms that are

[03:41:11 - 03:41:16]
uh predicting or forecasting things

[03:41:13 - 03:41:18]
Based on data so again we're going to

[03:41:16 - 03:41:21]
keep spending time learning about data

[03:41:18 - 03:41:25]
stuff to help us with machine learning

[03:41:21 - 03:41:28]
[Music]

[03:41:25 - 03:41:31]
okay a data scientist is a person with

[03:41:28 - 03:41:33]
multidisciplinary skills in math stats

[03:41:31 - 03:41:34]
predictive modeling and machine learning

[03:41:33 - 03:41:36]
and so you're basically bringing

[03:41:34 - 03:41:39]
computer science math and statistics and

[03:41:36 - 03:41:41]
domain knowledge into one thing to be a

[03:41:39 - 03:41:43]
data scientist but there's these other

[03:41:41 - 03:41:44]
skills that you can see that almost kind

[03:41:43 - 03:41:46]
of make you data scientist but if you're

[03:41:44 - 03:41:49]
missing one one of these then you're not

[03:41:46 - 03:41:50]
necessarily a data scientist but for the

[03:41:49 - 03:41:52]
reason why computer science is important

[03:41:50 - 03:41:54]
is that um a lot of machine learning

[03:41:52 - 03:41:55]
models are based off of algorithms and

[03:41:54 - 03:41:57]
so having that traditional compsite

[03:41:55 - 03:41:59]
background is going to help you there

[03:41:57 - 03:42:02]
then In classical machine learning this

[03:41:59 - 03:42:03]
heavily relies on statistics so that's

[03:42:02 - 03:42:05]
where that math and stats background is

[03:42:03 - 03:42:07]
going to be very useful uh software

[03:42:05 - 03:42:09]
development skills are useful because

[03:42:07 - 03:42:12]
you're going to be writing lots of

[03:42:09 - 03:42:13]
python um so that is very important or

[03:42:12 - 03:42:14]
if you want something to be very

[03:42:13 - 03:42:16]
performant you're going to have to use

[03:42:14 - 03:42:18]
lower

[03:42:16 - 03:42:20]
languages um you know you need to have

[03:42:18 - 03:42:23]
traditional research because you need to

[03:42:20 - 03:42:25]
Source clean prepare analyze data um and

[03:42:23 - 03:42:28]
make sure that it's valid uh so a lot of

[03:42:25 - 03:42:29]
stuff there and to be able to build of

[03:42:28 - 03:42:32]
anything of use you need to have deep

[03:42:29 - 03:42:36]
domain knowledge on a specific industry

[03:42:32 - 03:42:37]
or um knowledge so there you go the the

[03:42:36 - 03:42:39]
definition of responsib of data science

[03:42:37 - 03:42:42]
can vary per company but will generally

[03:42:39 - 03:42:44]
have strong skills specialization in one

[03:42:42 - 03:42:46]
of these three so just understand that

[03:42:44 - 03:42:47]
I'm defining it here and you're going to

[03:42:46 - 03:42:49]
probably see some variance of

[03:42:47 - 03:42:52]
definitions

[03:42:49 - 03:42:55]
[Music]

[03:42:52 - 03:42:57]
online all right let's do a data rule

[03:42:55 - 03:42:59]
comparison just in case we are not sure

[03:42:57 - 03:43:00]
what all these data rules are we have

[03:42:59 - 03:43:02]
data mining so get knowledge about a

[03:43:00 - 03:43:04]
particular data set and use this

[03:43:02 - 03:43:06]
knowledge for learning or processing uh

[03:43:04 - 03:43:09]
processing purpose data wrangling so

[03:43:06 - 03:43:10]
converting and mapping data from its raw

[03:43:09 - 03:43:12]
form to another format with the purpose

[03:43:10 - 03:43:14]
of making it more valuable and

[03:43:12 - 03:43:15]
appropriate for advanced tests such as

[03:43:14 - 03:43:19]
data analytics and Mach machine learning

[03:43:15 - 03:43:21]
data analysis using existing information

[03:43:19 - 03:43:23]
to uncover actional data answering

[03:43:21 - 03:43:26]
questions generated for Better Business

[03:43:23 - 03:43:29]
decision- making data scientists so

[03:43:26 - 03:43:30]
multi-disciplinary skills and math stats

[03:43:29 - 03:43:33]
predictive modeling machine learning to

[03:43:30 - 03:43:34]
make future predictions data engineer

[03:43:33 - 03:43:36]
focused on infrastructure and

[03:43:34 - 03:43:39]
architecture of data generation and the

[03:43:36 - 03:43:41]
movement of data deploying Machinery

[03:43:39 - 03:43:45]
models at scale or in a distributed

[03:43:41 - 03:43:45]
architecture so there you go

[03:43:46 - 03:43:49]
[Music]

[03:43:48 - 03:43:51]
all right so when we're talking about

[03:43:49 - 03:43:53]
data sets there's the training data set

[03:43:51 - 03:43:55]
the validation data set and the test

[03:43:53 - 03:43:56]
data set so the train data set is the

[03:43:55 - 03:43:59]
actual data that the model is going to

[03:43:56 - 03:44:02]
learn on the validation data set is just

[03:43:59 - 03:44:04]
um used to validate whether the model is

[03:44:02 - 03:44:06]
working correctly and specifically if

[03:44:04 - 03:44:08]
we're looking to fine-tune our models

[03:44:06 - 03:44:09]
hyperparameters and then you have a test

[03:44:08 - 03:44:12]
data set which sounds very similar to

[03:44:09 - 03:44:14]
the validation uh data set but it's here

[03:44:12 - 03:44:18]
to provide an unbias Val valuation the

[03:44:14 - 03:44:20]
final model after it's been retrained um

[03:44:18 - 03:44:21]
so where is ground truth in here well

[03:44:20 - 03:44:25]
all of these can have a bit of ground

[03:44:21 - 03:44:27]
truth um so just understand that ground

[03:44:25 - 03:44:29]
truth data is data that has been labeled

[03:44:27 - 03:44:31]
to being correct and your training data

[03:44:29 - 03:44:34]
set all these data sets can have ground

[03:44:31 - 03:44:35]
Truth uh data in them but the model

[03:44:34 - 03:44:39]
doesn't know that right you know that as

[03:44:35 - 03:44:42]
a means to uh test against your model

[03:44:39 - 03:44:45]
[Music]

[03:44:42 - 03:44:47]
okay so we're talking about Corpus and a

[03:44:45 - 03:44:49]
corpus is a large collection of

[03:44:47 - 03:44:51]
naturally curring texts in a structured

[03:44:49 - 03:44:54]
way for analysis a corpus could be as

[03:44:51 - 03:44:58]
little as 50,000 words or tens of

[03:44:54 - 03:45:02]
millions of words um a corpora could be

[03:44:58 - 03:45:04]
sourced from books newspapers magazines

[03:45:02 - 03:45:06]
transcripts and web pages examples of

[03:45:04 - 03:45:08]
Corpus would be accompanied needs to

[03:45:06 - 03:45:10]
create an English dictionary so they

[03:45:08 - 03:45:13]
need a corpus of text of words to

[03:45:10 - 03:45:15]
provide examples of the dictionary words

[03:45:13 - 03:45:17]
or a company needs to create academic

[03:45:15 - 03:45:19]
textt so they need a corpus of texts

[03:45:17 - 03:45:21]
composed of transcripts from lectures

[03:45:19 - 03:45:24]
and seminars Corpus are intended to be

[03:45:21 - 03:45:26]
analyzed to see how a language is being

[03:45:24 - 03:45:28]
used now let's talk about what Corpus

[03:45:26 - 03:45:31]
Linguistics are so this is the study of

[03:45:28 - 03:45:34]
languages or language and uses corpuses

[03:45:31 - 03:45:37]
to perform the following statistical

[03:45:34 - 03:45:40]
analysis hypothesis testing checking

[03:45:37 - 03:45:42]
occurrences validating linguistic rules

[03:45:40 - 03:45:45]
all of these are within the specific

[03:45:42 - 03:45:47]
language territory Corpus linguistics is

[03:45:45 - 03:45:49]
the act of looking for patterns that can

[03:45:47 - 03:45:52]
be Associated to lexical and grammatical

[03:45:49 - 03:45:53]
features these identify patterns that

[03:45:52 - 03:45:56]
are used to answer questions like what

[03:45:53 - 03:45:59]
is the most frequently used word how do

[03:45:56 - 03:46:02]
people use certain words how often is

[03:45:59 - 03:46:05]
tic Expressions used how many words does

[03:46:02 - 03:46:08]
a person use to carry conversation which

[03:46:05 - 03:46:10]
words are used in a formal situation so

[03:46:08 - 03:46:11]
yeah the word Corpus and Corpus

[03:46:10 - 03:46:12]
Linguistics is something you'll come

[03:46:11 - 03:46:14]
across when learning about machine

[03:46:12 - 03:46:16]
learning so I just wanted to make sure

[03:46:14 - 03:46:19]
you knew what it was

[03:46:16 - 03:46:21]
[Music]

[03:46:19 - 03:46:24]
was let's talk about what is a data set

[03:46:21 - 03:46:26]
so a data set is a particular kind of

[03:46:24 - 03:46:28]
data item that serves a specific purpose

[03:46:26 - 03:46:30]
so operations that can be performed

[03:46:28 - 03:46:31]
using data in machine learning and the

[03:46:30 - 03:46:33]
following data types are important to

[03:46:31 - 03:46:35]
know so what do we need to know well we

[03:46:33 - 03:46:38]
need to know what qualitive is so this

[03:46:35 - 03:46:41]
is measured by the quality of something

[03:46:38 - 03:46:43]
rather than its quantity then you have

[03:46:41 - 03:46:45]
quantitative so this is measured by the

[03:46:43 - 03:46:48]
quantity of something

[03:46:45 - 03:46:51]
rather than its quality let's go down um

[03:46:48 - 03:46:53]
the tree on the qualitive side so here

[03:46:51 - 03:46:56]
we have categorical so these are values

[03:46:53 - 03:46:59]
that are labels you have discrete so

[03:46:56 - 03:47:01]
this is something that countable and uh

[03:46:59 - 03:47:03]
finite and only values are possible

[03:47:01 - 03:47:05]
under discret we have binary so data

[03:47:03 - 03:47:07]
types that only have two possible

[03:47:05 - 03:47:10]
options say zero or one or true or false

[03:47:07 - 03:47:14]
nominal so labels where order does not

[03:47:10 - 03:47:18]
matter and ordinal so labels where order

[03:47:14 - 03:47:21]
does matter on the quantitative side we

[03:47:18 - 03:47:23]
have numerical values so these are just

[03:47:21 - 03:47:26]
numbers you have continuous so not

[03:47:23 - 03:47:28]
countable and infinite many possible

[03:47:26 - 03:47:30]
values and can be measured and

[03:47:28 - 03:47:33]
underneath we have interval so a

[03:47:30 - 03:47:35]
continuous value that has uh has no zero

[03:47:33 - 03:47:38]
and then a continuous value that

[03:47:35 - 03:47:41]
includes zero so it's not ho zero it's

[03:47:38 - 03:47:43]
just no Zer uh but yeah it's just these

[03:47:41 - 03:47:45]
terms are going to come up when you are

[03:47:43 - 03:47:46]
reading about machine learning things

[03:47:45 - 03:47:48]
like that and so just having a general

[03:47:46 - 03:47:51]
idea of this makes it a lot easier

[03:47:48 - 03:47:55]
because these are less of uh programmer

[03:47:51 - 03:47:59]
terms and more like mathematical terms

[03:47:55 - 03:48:01]
[Music]

[03:47:59 - 03:48:03]
okay hey everyone it's Andrew Brown and

[03:48:01 - 03:48:04]
I'm back with Rola again as we're taking

[03:48:03 - 03:48:07]
a look at

[03:48:04 - 03:48:09]
leaderboards um so you know I think that

[03:48:07 - 03:48:12]
something that's really important is

[03:48:09 - 03:48:13]
being able to understand uh how your

[03:48:12 - 03:48:17]
model compares to other models so that

[03:48:13 - 03:48:19]
we can make the uh best choice when

[03:48:17 - 03:48:21]
choosing our models um but I'm going to

[03:48:19 - 03:48:23]
be honest with you I don't know the best

[03:48:21 - 03:48:25]
way to evaluate these and so I'm hoping

[03:48:23 - 03:48:28]
that Rola can help us dig a little bit

[03:48:25 - 03:48:30]
deeper than what I was looking at in

[03:48:28 - 03:48:31]
Prior videos um so I'm going to go ahead

[03:48:30 - 03:48:34]
and share my screen and I already have a

[03:48:31 - 03:48:36]
few links pulled up here so I'm going to

[03:48:34 - 03:48:38]
go ahead and share my screen making sure

[03:48:36 - 03:48:42]
that it is the correct

[03:48:38 - 03:48:44]
screen um and so I think we all we all

[03:48:42 - 03:48:46]
can see my screen now I'm going to go

[03:48:44 - 03:48:48]
yeah go side view for right now and

[03:48:46 - 03:48:51]
right now I have pulled up artificial

[03:48:48 - 03:48:55]
analysis. we also have uh anthropic CLA

[03:48:51 - 03:48:58]
I believe this is um which model is this

[03:48:55 - 03:49:01]
this is oh it's just the the family

[03:48:58 - 03:49:03]
model so opon and Haiku and we also have

[03:49:01 - 03:49:06]
the hugging face leaderboard and we have

[03:49:03 - 03:49:08]
live bench um and so what I want to do

[03:49:06 - 03:49:11]
is first go over to a model card and

[03:49:08 - 03:49:14]
talk a little bit what a model card is

[03:49:11 - 03:49:16]
and then uh Rolo will promtly correct my

[03:49:14 - 03:49:18]
uh my description

[03:49:16 - 03:49:20]
because I I everything to me is just

[03:49:18 - 03:49:22]
like like a model card basically

[03:49:20 - 03:49:26]
describes how the model Works how it

[03:49:22 - 03:49:28]
performs um and I don't know uh other

[03:49:26 - 03:49:29]
additional information that you might

[03:49:28 - 03:49:31]
want to know about the model what would

[03:49:29 - 03:49:33]
your description be of a model card

[03:49:31 - 03:49:36]
roller like what's the purpose of a

[03:49:33 - 03:49:39]
model card yeah so the model card is a

[03:49:36 - 03:49:42]
summarized uh kind of like a resume if

[03:49:39 - 03:49:44]
you will for a model so it'll tell you

[03:49:42 - 03:49:46]
uh the basic architecture of the model

[03:49:44 - 03:49:49]
what data was it's supposed to tell you

[03:49:46 - 03:49:51]
what data is trained on um sometimes how

[03:49:49 - 03:49:56]
to use it and and everything you should

[03:49:51 - 03:49:58]
need for um using that model so think of

[03:49:56 - 03:50:01]
it as a

[03:49:58 - 03:50:03]
resume and uh now resumes can be

[03:50:01 - 03:50:06]
standardized are is there some level of

[03:50:03 - 03:50:09]
standardization with model cards like or

[03:50:06 - 03:50:11]
or an Unwritten Unwritten uh agreement

[03:50:09 - 03:50:13]
that we should always have these these

[03:50:11 - 03:50:14]
benchmarks or basically people just see

[03:50:13 - 03:50:16]
what other people do and they go I like

[03:50:14 - 03:50:17]
that throw mind in my model card yeah I

[03:50:16 - 03:50:20]
think there's a big problem in

[03:50:17 - 03:50:21]
standardization in general in the field

[03:50:20 - 03:50:23]
um I think there's a common

[03:50:21 - 03:50:25]
understanding that model cards are

[03:50:23 - 03:50:29]
important that they should exist uh in

[03:50:25 - 03:50:30]
terms of what is on those models I don't

[03:50:29 - 03:50:33]
think there is General agreement there's

[03:50:30 - 03:50:34]
of course best practices and and

[03:50:33 - 03:50:40]
different people doing different things

[03:50:34 - 03:50:43]
but uh yeah no we every I think every

[03:50:40 - 03:50:46]
company is putting different things in

[03:50:43 - 03:50:49]
them h one one thing that I see in model

[03:50:46 - 03:50:52]
cards a lot um and again maybe it's not

[03:50:49 - 03:50:54]
standardized across it but I'll see uh

[03:50:52 - 03:50:56]
these uh metrics or rubrics where

[03:50:54 - 03:50:58]
they're showing different things that

[03:50:56 - 03:50:59]
they've uh put their model against so

[03:50:58 - 03:51:03]
I'm assuming the things on the left hand

[03:50:59 - 03:51:08]
side like MML math human eval are is a

[03:51:03 - 03:51:10]
data set or of uh it's like things some

[03:51:08 - 03:51:13]
benchmarking that they want to perform

[03:51:10 - 03:51:17]
so uh and this was the result that it

[03:51:13 - 03:51:20]
had uh uh you know here and so I always

[03:51:17 - 03:51:23]
see this but one thing that uh a lot of

[03:51:20 - 03:51:27]
us um um I hear a lot is that be

[03:51:23 - 03:51:28]
cautious of of benchmarks that come from

[03:51:27 - 03:51:30]
the provider itself because they could

[03:51:28 - 03:51:32]
be biased intentionally or

[03:51:30 - 03:51:35]
unintentionally and so even if we have

[03:51:32 - 03:51:38]
these uh you know can we trust them or

[03:51:35 - 03:51:40]
where's the better place to look and

[03:51:38 - 03:51:41]
even if we have these benchmarks what

[03:51:40 - 03:51:43]
can we even do with them like how does

[03:51:41 - 03:51:45]
it even make us inform like okay it's

[03:51:43 - 03:51:47]
good at math what does that mean for my

[03:51:45 - 03:51:51]
Japanese uh game that I'm trying to

[03:51:47 - 03:51:53]
build that's a visual novel right um so

[03:51:51 - 03:51:54]
there is another leaderboard and you're

[03:51:53 - 03:51:56]
the one that you're the one that shared

[03:51:54 - 03:51:58]
me all these leaderboards to be honest

[03:51:56 - 03:52:01]
um but one that you showed me was

[03:51:58 - 03:52:03]
artificial analysis and so it looks like

[03:52:01 - 03:52:06]
this basically has a collection of uh a

[03:52:03 - 03:52:08]
lot of models and if we were to go in

[03:52:06 - 03:52:12]
and take a look at like let's say

[03:52:08 - 03:52:14]
anthropic uh anthropic CLA 3.5 son if we

[03:52:12 - 03:52:17]
can find it um I know thropic is very

[03:52:14 - 03:52:19]
popular these days but here we have uh

[03:52:17 - 03:52:21]
June and October October is sooner so

[03:52:19 - 03:52:23]
we'll go ahead and choose this one and

[03:52:21 - 03:52:25]
what I'm looking for down here is that

[03:52:23 - 03:52:28]
we will

[03:52:25 - 03:52:31]
see mlu right and then we go over to

[03:52:28 - 03:52:33]
here and we see mlu and I'm going oh

[03:52:31 - 03:52:36]
that's cool I still don't know what mlu

[03:52:33 - 03:52:38]
is though okay uh so let's let's maybe

[03:52:36 - 03:52:41]
step one back and then we'll we'll talk

[03:52:38 - 03:52:44]
about mlu specifically so there are the

[03:52:41 - 03:52:47]
idea of benchmarks right um let's start

[03:52:44 - 03:52:49]
actually one step backwards so there's a

[03:52:47 - 03:52:52]
traditionally um predictive machine

[03:52:49 - 03:52:54]
learning not the Gen uh was more test

[03:52:52 - 03:52:56]
specific so you would come in you would

[03:52:54 - 03:52:59]
take a model you would uh teach it a

[03:52:56 - 03:53:03]
very specific task and uh you would

[03:52:59 - 03:53:06]
evaluate it on that task right um

[03:53:03 - 03:53:10]
generative AI uh these very big models

[03:53:06 - 03:53:11]
they have uh more General capabilities

[03:53:10 - 03:53:13]
they can do a lot of things and there's

[03:53:11 - 03:53:15]
what we call emerging capabilities as

[03:53:13 - 03:53:17]
well right things that we didn't think

[03:53:15 - 03:53:19]
they could necessarily do or they they

[03:53:17 - 03:53:20]
they weren't trained to do it turns out

[03:53:19 - 03:53:22]
that because they're big models because

[03:53:20 - 03:53:25]
they see a lot of data they can do a lot

[03:53:22 - 03:53:27]
of things and um given that these are

[03:53:25 - 03:53:30]
General things they're not very task

[03:53:27 - 03:53:33]
specific how do you know what they can

[03:53:30 - 03:53:36]
do and how well they can do it and so

[03:53:33 - 03:53:40]
this idea of benchmarking them um comes

[03:53:36 - 03:53:43]
in right to to have these standard tests

[03:53:40 - 03:53:45]
kind of like we take the SATs or we take

[03:53:43 - 03:53:47]
uh different tests to qualify for

[03:53:45 - 03:53:49]
University uh there's these different

[03:53:47 - 03:53:51]
tests for these models today and there's

[03:53:49 - 03:53:54]
a bunch of them as you can see um and

[03:53:51 - 03:53:56]
they're all made to test a very specific

[03:53:54 - 03:53:59]
thing so the mlu is the massive

[03:53:56 - 03:54:02]
multitask language understanding it's um

[03:53:59 - 03:54:05]
and what it does is it it mainly checks

[03:54:02 - 03:54:06]
um accuracy and knowledge acquired so

[03:54:05 - 03:54:09]
it's looking for knowledge there's the

[03:54:06 - 03:54:11]
mlu pro which checks for reasoning as

[03:54:09 - 03:54:13]
well so what you're going to see is

[03:54:11 - 03:54:15]
there's a lot of different benchmarks um

[03:54:13 - 03:54:19]
these are what they technically are a

[03:54:15 - 03:54:20]
set of tasks and they are um geared to

[03:54:19 - 03:54:22]
test something specific and if you look

[03:54:20 - 03:54:25]
at some of the leaderboards they're

[03:54:22 - 03:54:29]
going to tell you

[03:54:25 - 03:54:33]
um yeah so and they'll tell you when a

[03:54:29 - 03:54:36]
if you go back to the um artificial

[03:54:33 - 03:54:39]
analysis leaderboard I think it was

[03:54:36 - 03:54:41]
there um and sorry just as a side

[03:54:39 - 03:54:42]
sidebar because I keep seeing this word

[03:54:41 - 03:54:44]
chinchilla and I don't know anything

[03:54:42 - 03:54:46]
about this model what is with this

[03:54:44 - 03:54:50]
chinchilla model I know this is totally

[03:54:46 - 03:54:54]
uh off off the side here but uh what is

[03:54:50 - 03:54:55]
it so this is a model uh that uh this

[03:54:54 - 03:54:57]
actually I'm more interested in the

[03:54:55 - 03:54:58]
chinchilla paper as opposed to the

[03:54:57 - 03:55:01]
chinchilla model this is a really cool

[03:54:58 - 03:55:04]
uh paper that came up with this model

[03:55:01 - 03:55:08]
and what it looked at was um it

[03:55:04 - 03:55:09]
evaluated the model size versus the data

[03:55:08 - 03:55:12]
sets versus the compute resources so it

[03:55:09 - 03:55:14]
really looked at all of the resources

[03:55:12 - 03:55:16]
around model training it's a really cool

[03:55:14 - 03:55:19]
paper I think everybody should should

[03:55:16 - 03:55:21]
reel this paper um and it came out we we

[03:55:19 - 03:55:24]
mentioned this in in a previous video

[03:55:21 - 03:55:27]
but it it came out to talk about um uh

[03:55:24 - 03:55:29]
the requirements uh the resource

[03:55:27 - 03:55:31]
requirements the training uh the data

[03:55:29 - 03:55:35]
set required so they think that uh a lot

[03:55:31 - 03:55:39]
of models are overparameterized and

[03:55:35 - 03:55:45]
under trained and that you need about 20

[03:55:39 - 03:55:48]
times uh the tokens data set tokens um

[03:55:45 - 03:55:51]
compared to to model size so uh that's

[03:55:48 - 03:55:53]
what that is oh okay so basically this

[03:55:51 - 03:55:55]
is this is a research model the idea was

[03:55:53 - 03:55:56]
let's let's make a really big mod with a

[03:55:55 - 03:55:58]
lot of parameters and then try to figure

[03:55:56 - 03:56:02]
out how much how much data we have to

[03:55:58 - 03:56:06]
pass PDF like view the PDF it'll this is

[03:56:02 - 03:56:06]
a paper that looks at

[03:56:06 - 03:56:12]
um if you scroll through it uh it'll go

[03:56:10 - 03:56:15]
through and talk

[03:56:12 - 03:56:19]
about uh the model differ size models

[03:56:15 - 03:56:22]
and how much they need in terms of uh

[03:56:19 - 03:56:24]
the flops the the the compute demands

[03:56:22 - 03:56:28]
the work the the data set demand so it's

[03:56:24 - 03:56:32]
really um a paper that looked at the the

[03:56:28 - 03:56:33]
landscape of what people are doing

[03:56:32 - 03:56:35]
versus what you should be doing in terms

[03:56:33 - 03:56:39]
of training these

[03:56:35 - 03:56:41]
models oh okay

[03:56:39 - 03:56:44]
Prett a really cool

[03:56:41 - 03:56:46]
paper I feel like that would demystify a

[03:56:44 - 03:56:48]
lot about like how much data you need to

[03:56:46 - 03:56:51]
train right yes yes exactly and I think

[03:56:48 - 03:56:55]
they came up with the with this 20 times

[03:56:51 - 03:56:58]
uh the 20 times the parameter size in

[03:56:55 - 03:57:03]
terms of token sizes a token number you

[03:56:58 - 03:57:05]
need that's as a as a proxy for data

[03:57:03 - 03:57:07]
size okay um so let's go back over to

[03:57:05 - 03:57:09]
here sorry I just I just kept seeing it

[03:57:07 - 03:57:11]
I'm just like I need to know what it is

[03:57:09 - 03:57:12]
and so I'm not gonna ask what gopher is

[03:57:11 - 03:57:16]
I imagine it's gonna probably be like

[03:57:12 - 03:57:17]
another research model um but uh anyway

[03:57:16 - 03:57:20]
over here we're on the measuring massive

[03:57:17 - 03:57:24]
multitask language understanding yeah so

[03:57:20 - 03:57:26]
if you go back to the analysis um the

[03:57:24 - 03:57:28]
the leaderboard what you can see is CD

[03:57:26 - 03:57:30]
mlu that's a reasoning and Knowledge

[03:57:28 - 03:57:33]
Test that's what that Benchmark is is

[03:57:30 - 03:57:36]
used for uh if you see for example the

[03:57:33 - 03:57:38]
human eval under it that measures coding

[03:57:36 - 03:57:42]
capability so each of these benchmarks

[03:57:38 - 03:57:44]
is looking for a very particular uh

[03:57:42 - 03:57:46]
capability and so if you interested

[03:57:44 - 03:57:49]
depending on what you want to use the

[03:57:46 - 03:57:52]
model for you would come and look at its

[03:57:49 - 03:57:54]
performance on that very particular uh

[03:57:52 - 03:57:55]
data set right so if you want to use

[03:57:54 - 03:57:57]
something for coding you're not going to

[03:57:55 - 03:57:58]
look at the mlu because that doesn't

[03:57:57 - 03:58:01]
help you you're going to look at the

[03:57:58 - 03:58:04]
human eval um

[03:58:01 - 03:58:07]
performance I see so let's say I'm

[03:58:04 - 03:58:09]
trying to build a visual novel generator

[03:58:07 - 03:58:11]
because I want to immerse myself in

[03:58:09 - 03:58:14]
Japanese language learning and so I

[03:58:11 - 03:58:16]
would want to look for a specific

[03:58:14 - 03:58:19]
benchmark that would probably have to do

[03:58:16 - 03:58:21]
with the creativity of natural language

[03:58:19 - 03:58:23]
and so I'm not sure which one that would

[03:58:21 - 03:58:26]
be but like how would you know like

[03:58:23 - 03:58:29]
where would you find a list of possible

[03:58:26 - 03:58:31]
benchmarks um like is there a standard

[03:58:29 - 03:58:34]
standardized list somewhere or like even

[03:58:31 - 03:58:35]
on here it's like where do I find

[03:58:34 - 03:58:37]
there's

[03:58:35 - 03:58:39]
usually uh I don't know that it exists

[03:58:37 - 03:58:42]
in any particular place I could look one

[03:58:39 - 03:58:43]
for you but what usually happens in in

[03:58:42 - 03:58:47]
academic literature you have to remember

[03:58:43 - 03:58:50]
that although these things are very very

[03:58:47 - 03:58:52]
um popular in Industry they they they

[03:58:50 - 03:58:54]
have their roots in Academia right all

[03:58:52 - 03:58:56]
of these are papers published

[03:58:54 - 03:58:59]
peer-reviewed papers that are published

[03:58:56 - 03:59:02]
and so what ends up happening is uh

[03:58:59 - 03:59:04]
there's usually a a summary review and

[03:59:02 - 03:59:08]
I'm sure we can find if we go to PubMed

[03:59:04 - 03:59:10]
or archives we would be able to find a a

[03:59:08 - 03:59:12]
paper let me actually look through

[03:59:10 - 03:59:14]
archives really fast and

[03:59:12 - 03:59:17]
um uh

[03:59:14 - 03:59:17]
bench

[03:59:19 - 03:59:26]
mark I think I've seen you're looking

[03:59:22 - 03:59:29]
that up serious oh sorry yes no I think

[03:59:26 - 03:59:31]
I've seen one in in the literature uh

[03:59:29 - 03:59:34]
and so you you should be able to find a

[03:59:31 - 03:59:37]
an academic lit you can probably find

[03:59:34 - 03:59:40]
any sort of um reference I I usually go

[03:59:37 - 03:59:44]
for academic summary papers that would

[03:59:40 - 03:59:46]
go in and kind of um Assemble everything

[03:59:44 - 03:59:48]
that was published and put it in a

[03:59:46 - 03:59:50]
single place and if you want after this

[03:59:48 - 03:59:53]
video I could look one up that's

[03:59:50 - 03:59:53]
reasonable and we can attach it to this

[03:59:55 - 04:00:01]
video so so I mean it looks like a lot

[03:59:58 - 04:00:02]
of these like here at least um uh and we

[04:00:01 - 04:00:05]
haven't talked about hugging face but

[04:00:02 - 04:00:06]
hugging face has their own uh uh uh

[04:00:05 - 04:00:07]
leaderboard looks like they have

[04:00:06 - 04:00:09]
multiple

[04:00:07 - 04:00:10]
leaderboards so I guess it depends on

[04:00:09 - 04:00:12]
what you're looking at but we're just in

[04:00:10 - 04:00:15]
the open llm so that's obviously going

[04:00:12 - 04:00:17]
to just be open language models and so

[04:00:15 - 04:00:21]
they have some very

[04:00:17 - 04:00:23]
specific benchmarks that are here um and

[04:00:21 - 04:00:25]
I mean we only see this 1 two 3 four

[04:00:23 - 04:00:27]
five what is it 1 two 3 four five six

[04:00:25 - 04:00:30]
seven so we have those seven there how

[04:00:27 - 04:00:31]
many do we have over here we have

[04:00:30 - 04:00:34]
basically six I wonder if they're

[04:00:31 - 04:00:36]
settling on the same ones each time or

[04:00:34 - 04:00:40]
maybe it's Tas specific if we go over to

[04:00:36 - 04:00:45]
here um like this one has human

[04:00:40 - 04:00:45]
reasoning change a little bit um

[04:00:47 - 04:00:50]
but I guess I look at this I'm like I

[04:00:48 - 04:00:53]
was like okay math is great and all but

[04:00:50 - 04:00:56]
like you know does everyone care about

[04:00:53 - 04:00:57]
math and it's just like I wonder why I'm

[04:00:56 - 04:00:58]
just trying to like try to make sense

[04:00:57 - 04:01:00]
like I'm coming to hugging face and I

[04:00:58 - 04:01:02]
want to choose a model is this enough

[04:01:00 - 04:01:06]
information for me to start figuring out

[04:01:02 - 04:01:08]
which model to choose or it's

[04:01:06 - 04:01:10]
not well so if you want to choose a

[04:01:08 - 04:01:13]
model then you first have to decide what

[04:01:10 - 04:01:16]
do I need that model for right what task

[04:01:13 - 04:01:18]
is it doing is it coding is it creating

[04:01:16 - 04:01:19]
language is it doing reasoning problems

[04:01:18 - 04:01:23]
that that's number

[04:01:19 - 04:01:27]
one let's oh sorry so let's say creating

[04:01:23 - 04:01:28]
language right so we go here and then

[04:01:27 - 04:01:30]
this is all we have right and they seem

[04:01:28 - 04:01:32]
very math focused at least I mean this

[04:01:30 - 04:01:34]
one's General reasoning right I think we

[04:01:32 - 04:01:37]
said MML General Reas re math is

[04:01:34 - 04:01:38]
important is because uh it's it's the

[04:01:37 - 04:01:42]
Achilles heel of these things they don't

[04:01:38 - 04:01:43]
do math very well and so there's a

[04:01:42 - 04:01:46]
general perception that these things

[04:01:43 - 04:01:47]
don't have have a good understanding of

[04:01:46 - 04:01:49]
the real world they don't understand

[04:01:47 - 04:01:52]
physics they don't understand math they

[04:01:49 - 04:01:54]
they're putting language one word after

[04:01:52 - 04:01:57]
the other and a lot of times it doesn't

[04:01:54 - 04:02:01]
understand the the the reasoning physics

[04:01:57 - 04:02:03]
and math are still uh hit and miss and

[04:02:01 - 04:02:07]
that's why they're important and that

[04:02:03 - 04:02:10]
there there's we need to understand

[04:02:07 - 04:02:12]
um if of course it's relevant to the

[04:02:10 - 04:02:13]
task we're doing if if these models are

[04:02:12 - 04:02:16]
good at that if they're starting to pick

[04:02:13 - 04:02:17]
it up or so so I guess my question is

[04:02:16 - 04:02:20]
like if I'm doing Creative World

[04:02:17 - 04:02:22]
building uh for for my Japanese visual

[04:02:20 - 04:02:24]
novel does it need to know math because

[04:02:22 - 04:02:26]
that's part of the World building no no

[04:02:24 - 04:02:27]
it doesn't but that's why there's so

[04:02:26 - 04:02:29]
many different benchmarks right if if

[04:02:27 - 04:02:31]
we're all looking for a single thing

[04:02:29 - 04:02:33]
then there would be only one metric to

[04:02:31 - 04:02:36]
look at but because these things can do

[04:02:33 - 04:02:38]
a variety of tasks and because we use

[04:02:36 - 04:02:39]
them for a variety of different things

[04:02:38 - 04:02:40]
that's why there's a variety of

[04:02:39 - 04:02:43]
different benchmarks and what you need

[04:02:40 - 04:02:47]
to do is you need to understand which

[04:02:43 - 04:02:49]
benchmark Mark specifically um reflects

[04:02:47 - 04:02:51]
the metric that you care about and then

[04:02:49 - 04:02:53]
look at that now I we talked a little

[04:02:51 - 04:02:56]
bit about you mentioned before that when

[04:02:53 - 04:02:58]
uh that the actual provider has their

[04:02:56 - 04:03:01]
own benchmarks and I should mention that

[04:02:58 - 04:03:03]
when a lot of these are peer-reviewed so

[04:03:01 - 04:03:05]
again they come a lot of this is

[04:03:03 - 04:03:07]
academic it is published in

[04:03:05 - 04:03:11]
peer-reviewed academic papers and when

[04:03:07 - 04:03:13]
you come in to publish a new model um

[04:03:11 - 04:03:16]
the journal itself the it what what your

[04:03:13 - 04:03:19]
reviewed means is you submit this uh

[04:03:16 - 04:03:22]
work to a prestigious journal and then

[04:03:19 - 04:03:26]
what happens is um at least two or three

[04:03:22 - 04:03:27]
people have to uh evaluate it and one of

[04:03:26 - 04:03:31]
the evaluation is well how does it

[04:03:27 - 04:03:33]
compare to what already exists and so as

[04:03:31 - 04:03:36]
part of the publication process there is

[04:03:33 - 04:03:38]
some sort of benchmarking or or um

[04:03:36 - 04:03:40]
metric

[04:03:38 - 04:03:42]
assessment uh that comes in of course

[04:03:40 - 04:03:44]
that is done by the provider themselves

[04:03:42 - 04:03:45]
there's potentially some bias like you

[04:03:44 - 04:03:48]
said it could be it could be totally

[04:03:45 - 04:03:52]
unintentional but it is subjective um

[04:03:48 - 04:03:56]
and so these third party

[04:03:52 - 04:03:57]
leadership uh systems exist um and and

[04:03:56 - 04:04:00]
of course the other thing that's

[04:03:57 - 04:04:02]
important is because this when it was

[04:04:00 - 04:04:05]
published uh it's a single point in time

[04:04:02 - 04:04:07]
right it's a single point in time uh but

[04:04:05 - 04:04:10]
these things are coming out all of the

[04:04:07 - 04:04:12]
time and so these leadership boards are

[04:04:10 - 04:04:14]
cool because they keep up to dat so they

[04:04:12 - 04:04:18]
are running things

[04:04:14 - 04:04:20]
uh at a at an at a regular interval uh

[04:04:18 - 04:04:23]
to see how things compare with time so

[04:04:20 - 04:04:26]
that's why that that's interesting it's

[04:04:23 - 04:04:27]
always really cool to read the to scroll

[04:04:26 - 04:04:31]
through the initial paper that came out

[04:04:27 - 04:04:34]
and look how it it did at the time uh

[04:04:31 - 04:04:37]
but for for but it's moving really

[04:04:34 - 04:04:39]
really fast and so these leadership uh

[04:04:37 - 04:04:42]
leaderboards that are handed by third

[04:04:39 - 04:04:44]
party companies um are interesting to

[04:04:42 - 04:04:46]
see how things still compete how things

[04:04:44 - 04:04:51]
come uh with with

[04:04:46 - 04:04:53]
various uh as things come

[04:04:51 - 04:04:55]
out yeah so what you need you so what

[04:04:53 - 04:04:57]
you want to do is you you want to

[04:04:55 - 04:04:59]
understand what you want to do this for

[04:04:57 - 04:05:00]
um and so you would look at the

[04:04:59 - 04:05:02]
Benchmark that does that specifically

[04:05:00 - 04:05:05]
and a lot of these leader boards are

[04:05:02 - 04:05:09]
telling you um but you can also do some

[04:05:05 - 04:05:10]
work uh to understand what the Benchmark

[04:05:09 - 04:05:12]
is uh then you want to look at

[04:05:10 - 04:05:15]
performance and quality and all of that

[04:05:12 - 04:05:17]
which I think the leader boards have um

[04:05:15 - 04:05:19]
this one is really cool the live bench

[04:05:17 - 04:05:20]
and the reason I sent you that one is

[04:05:19 - 04:05:23]
because there is a

[04:05:20 - 04:05:25]
worry that there might be some

[04:05:23 - 04:05:29]
contamination in the benchmarking in

[04:05:25 - 04:05:31]
that these Benchmark um these Benchmark

[04:05:29 - 04:05:34]
data sets are online and a lot of what

[04:05:31 - 04:05:37]
these llms are being trained on is data

[04:05:34 - 04:05:40]
online so it could be a a very important

[04:05:37 - 04:05:42]
part of evaluation is that you don't

[04:05:40 - 04:05:43]
cheat that you don't know the answers

[04:05:42 - 04:05:46]
right that if if you have a test and

[04:05:43 - 04:05:48]
you've you have you've already have the

[04:05:46 - 04:05:49]
answers and you studied them because

[04:05:48 - 04:05:52]
your friend gave them to you then we

[04:05:49 - 04:05:55]
have a problem the test is inaccurate

[04:05:52 - 04:05:57]
right and so the fact that all of these

[04:05:55 - 04:06:01]
leaderboard that these are these

[04:05:57 - 04:06:04]
benchmarks the data is online and a lot

[04:06:01 - 04:06:06]
of companies scrape data online to as

[04:06:04 - 04:06:08]
part of the training data set it could

[04:06:06 - 04:06:11]
be that the answers could be leaked so

[04:06:08 - 04:06:13]
the the the so they don't they don't

[04:06:11 - 04:06:16]
they don't know so because so just a a

[04:06:13 - 04:06:18]
to try to rephrase is that when you go

[04:06:16 - 04:06:20]
and you are evaluating a model there is

[04:06:18 - 04:06:21]
data that is supposed to be withheld

[04:06:20 - 04:06:23]
that nobody knows the answers to so that

[04:06:21 - 04:06:25]
you can fairly evaluate it but if they

[04:06:23 - 04:06:27]
scrape the data they might not even know

[04:06:25 - 04:06:29]
that it's in their model and so

[04:06:27 - 04:06:31]
potentially or yeah so there's there's

[04:06:29 - 04:06:33]
some worry now there's con there is

[04:06:31 - 04:06:36]
concerns that these models are seeing

[04:06:33 - 04:06:38]
the answers to these these uh benchmarks

[04:06:36 - 04:06:41]
as part of their training and so the

[04:06:38 - 04:06:45]
that makes the benchmarks themselves um

[04:06:41 - 04:06:48]
pretty um inaccurate and so what this

[04:06:45 - 04:06:51]
live bench does is it renews the

[04:06:48 - 04:06:54]
questions almost every month so there's

[04:06:51 - 04:06:56]
some it's not it's not a snapshot that

[04:06:54 - 04:06:59]
is online it's that there are questions

[04:06:56 - 04:07:02]
that are constantly coming in and that

[04:06:59 - 04:07:04]
kind of helps with the idea of the the

[04:07:02 - 04:07:06]
models having seen the data as part of

[04:07:04 - 04:07:09]
their training data and so this would be

[04:07:06 - 04:07:12]
a little bit more accurate um in that

[04:07:09 - 04:07:14]
these uh these questions are refreshed

[04:07:12 - 04:07:17]
well this sounds like real school

[04:07:14 - 04:07:19]
then you have to think of it

[04:07:17 - 04:07:21]
as yeah they leak it and you're trying

[04:07:19 - 04:07:23]
to prevent from doing it or exactly they

[04:07:21 - 04:07:26]
leaked and now you you make questions

[04:07:23 - 04:07:28]
every every other month or something to

[04:07:26 - 04:07:31]
I I recently had my uh Japanese uh

[04:07:28 - 04:07:33]
Japanese lessons two weeks ago and my

[04:07:31 - 04:07:36]
teacher thought I did a really good job

[04:07:33 - 04:07:39]
because she had used a piece of material

[04:07:36 - 04:07:40]
from shun's podcast but what she doesn't

[04:07:39 - 04:07:43]
know is that I had watched it early in

[04:07:40 - 04:07:44]
the day because it came up in my feed

[04:07:43 - 04:07:46]
but I didn't want to tell

[04:07:44 - 04:07:48]
her she like wow you're doing really

[04:07:46 - 04:07:50]
good I was like oh yeah but it wasn't

[04:07:48 - 04:07:52]
intentional it's just like I I was

[04:07:50 - 04:07:53]
exposed to that information and so it's

[04:07:52 - 04:07:55]
kind of like this where it's like you

[04:07:53 - 04:07:57]
don't realize that um the information

[04:07:55 - 04:07:58]
that's out there could be accessible to

[04:07:57 - 04:08:00]
your model as well and it already has

[04:07:58 - 04:08:02]
that knowledge and so you're going wow

[04:08:00 - 04:08:05]
you're doing a great job and the M's

[04:08:02 - 04:08:08]
going yeah I guess I must be yeah really

[04:08:05 - 04:08:10]
smart right so but yeah maybe I've seen

[04:08:08 - 04:08:13]
that material before in its exact form

[04:08:10 - 04:08:15]
but um yeah so this is really cool the

[04:08:13 - 04:08:18]
live mention that there's some uh

[04:08:15 - 04:08:20]
there's some refresh ratio that comes in

[04:08:18 - 04:08:21]
one nice thing that this one has that

[04:08:20 - 04:08:22]
and this is just me talking

[04:08:21 - 04:08:24]
superficially looking at these things

[04:08:22 - 04:08:25]
but this one's telling me like reasoning

[04:08:24 - 04:08:27]
average where it's like you go over to

[04:08:25 - 04:08:31]
here this is reasoning and knowledge I

[04:08:27 - 04:08:33]
guess knowled and mlu yeah exactly so

[04:08:31 - 04:08:34]
they tell you what the Benchmark is and

[04:08:33 - 04:08:35]
then what it's supposed to be testing

[04:08:34 - 04:08:37]
for

[04:08:35 - 04:08:40]
specifically um and and there's a whole

[04:08:37 - 04:08:43]
bunch we can see that most leaderboards

[04:08:40 - 04:08:45]
uh are are choosing about six of them

[04:08:43 - 04:08:48]
and it looks like they're fairly the the

[04:08:45 - 04:08:51]
same uh six but I think based on what we

[04:08:48 - 04:08:52]
know they're being used we are using

[04:08:51 - 04:08:56]
them for coding so coding is there we

[04:08:52 - 04:08:58]
are using them for um language and

[04:08:56 - 04:09:02]
accuracy so that affects hallucinations

[04:08:58 - 04:09:03]
a reasoning questions um uh again so the

[04:09:02 - 04:09:06]
common things that we use these things

[04:09:03 - 04:09:08]
for of course you would have metrics to

[04:09:06 - 04:09:11]
give you an idea about their

[04:09:08 - 04:09:12]
performance okay and so then then here

[04:09:11 - 04:09:14]
comes my hard question which and I

[04:09:12 - 04:09:16]
already know the answer to it which is

[04:09:14 - 04:09:17]
what is your favorite model Rola and

[04:09:16 - 04:09:20]
you're going to tell me it

[04:09:17 - 04:09:21]
depends depends it really depends

[04:09:20 - 04:09:24]
honestly

[04:09:21 - 04:09:27]
um I surprisingly enough I I don't know

[04:09:24 - 04:09:31]
if I should say that I don't use gen as

[04:09:27 - 04:09:33]
much as I uh should but uh I could tell

[04:09:31 - 04:09:36]
you this I could tell you this my team

[04:09:33 - 04:09:39]
at where we work we we do love anthropic

[04:09:36 - 04:09:41]
we use a lot of it and it's probably

[04:09:39 - 04:09:43]
biased because uh apparently anthropic

[04:09:41 - 04:09:46]
and Claude are really really good at

[04:09:43 - 04:09:49]
code generation and we are coders so we

[04:09:46 - 04:09:53]
are uh and so we use a lot of uh

[04:09:49 - 04:09:54]
anthropic and and Claud so the same

[04:09:53 - 04:09:57]
thing it's like at the same time it's

[04:09:54 - 04:10:00]
like because you have deeper knowledge

[04:09:57 - 04:10:02]
of machine learning I think that maybe

[04:10:00 - 04:10:04]
you don't need to use you know when not

[04:10:02 - 04:10:06]
to use gen it's like like I'm really

[04:10:04 - 04:10:08]
good at at web application development

[04:10:06 - 04:10:10]
everyone uses Tailwind I'm like I can

[04:10:08 - 04:10:13]
use Tailwind but I would rather just

[04:10:10 - 04:10:15]
write it from hand because I can get the

[04:10:13 - 04:10:17]
exact results in the smallest amount of

[04:10:15 - 04:10:18]
footprint and like why wouldn't I do it

[04:10:17 - 04:10:21]
if I knew how to do it so do you feel

[04:10:18 - 04:10:23]
that a lot of times you're just using

[04:10:21 - 04:10:24]
the most cost- effective precise tool

[04:10:23 - 04:10:26]
because you have the domain knowledge to

[04:10:24 - 04:10:28]
do so and it's not that gen is bad it's

[04:10:26 - 04:10:31]
just that you know better it's not that

[04:10:28 - 04:10:36]
gen is bad no it's it's very powerful uh

[04:10:31 - 04:10:39]
the way to use it though uh it does have

[04:10:36 - 04:10:41]
um it I mean listen I I'm I'm an expert

[04:10:39 - 04:10:44]
I'm I'm a professional and like you said

[04:10:41 - 04:10:46]
you you gain your your experience and so

[04:10:44 - 04:10:49]
I know what I know and how to do things

[04:10:46 - 04:10:52]
I think what J is really really good at

[04:10:49 - 04:10:54]
is I always um have a hard time starting

[04:10:52 - 04:10:55]
like if you're starting a report or

[04:10:54 - 04:10:57]
you're starting a paper or you're

[04:10:55 - 04:11:00]
starting something it's really really

[04:10:57 - 04:11:04]
hard to put those first few paragraphs

[04:11:00 - 04:11:06]
and decide how to to direct and that's

[04:11:04 - 04:11:08]
where J comes in and that if it creates

[04:11:06 - 04:11:11]
a draft for

[04:11:08 - 04:11:13]
you then it becomes really easy I find I

[04:11:11 - 04:11:15]
can jump in a lot faster if with a draft

[04:11:13 - 04:11:20]
than if I'm creating from scratch and so

[04:11:15 - 04:11:24]
I use a lot of gen in in draft creation

[04:11:20 - 04:11:27]
um and in just um kind of polishing

[04:11:24 - 04:11:30]
things a little bit right

[04:11:27 - 04:11:31]
um uh and uh yeah I mean I'm just using

[04:11:30 - 04:11:34]
uh large language models to learn

[04:11:31 - 04:11:35]
Japanese and that's that's about it I

[04:11:34 - 04:11:38]
don't really have any other use cases

[04:11:35 - 04:11:40]
but um I'm sure other people do I hear I

[04:11:38 - 04:11:42]
hear in health there uh there's a lot of

[04:11:40 - 04:11:43]
interest there there's uh again I'm not

[04:11:42 - 04:11:47]
exactly sure what but large language

[04:11:43 - 04:11:48]
models are um uh there's a lot of

[04:11:47 - 04:11:50]
interest to evaluate them in in some

[04:11:48 - 04:11:53]
means to do something with something

[04:11:50 - 04:11:57]
with uh uh DNA or something I imagine

[04:11:53 - 04:11:59]
but that's beyond me uh but yeah again I

[04:11:57 - 04:12:02]
appreciate your time uh helping us look

[04:11:59 - 04:12:05]
at leaderboards um it's a lot more clear

[04:12:02 - 04:12:07]
to me how I can go about and try to uh

[04:12:05 - 04:12:08]
choose a better model I hope that it

[04:12:07 - 04:12:11]
makes a lot more sense for folks that

[04:12:08 - 04:12:13]
are watching here um I'm sure you are

[04:12:11 - 04:12:15]
going to pop up again and again uh to

[04:12:13 - 04:12:18]
help us out so again appreciate your

[04:12:15 - 04:12:20]
time again and uh we'll get back to uh

[04:12:18 - 04:12:20]
the course

[04:12:21 - 04:12:26]
[Music]

[04:12:24 - 04:12:28]
here hey this is Angie Brown in this

[04:12:26 - 04:12:30]
video I want to take a look at uh the

[04:12:28 - 04:12:32]
available AI power assistants that are

[04:12:30 - 04:12:34]
out there um we're just going to pull

[04:12:32 - 04:12:36]
them all up but I just want you to know

[04:12:34 - 04:12:38]
where they generally are um and get you

[04:12:36 - 04:12:40]
exposure to ones that you may have never

[04:12:38 - 04:12:41]
used before I think a lot of people know

[04:12:40 - 04:12:43]
chat PT so that might be the first one

[04:12:41 - 04:12:45]
we'll we'll take a look at so that will

[04:12:43 - 04:12:47]
be in its own tab here so we'll open

[04:12:45 - 04:12:49]
this one up here and I actually have a

[04:12:47 - 04:12:50]
paid version of chat gbt I think the

[04:12:49 - 04:12:52]
frustrating part is that every single

[04:12:50 - 04:12:54]
thing that uh every one of these AI

[04:12:52 - 04:12:58]
powered assistants they all cost 20

[04:12:54 - 04:12:59]
bucks right so you can't use them all um

[04:12:58 - 04:13:02]
but uh you know you'll have to pick your

[04:12:59 - 04:13:04]
favorite I like tachu BT because it's

[04:13:02 - 04:13:07]
not the best but it just generally works

[04:13:04 - 04:13:08]
really well and just keeps going right

[04:13:07 - 04:13:10]
um but you know it depends on your use

[04:13:08 - 04:13:13]
case let's go open up another one so

[04:13:10 - 04:13:15]
another one might be Gemini uh by Google

[04:13:13 - 04:13:17]
so this is another AI powered

[04:13:15 - 04:13:19]
assistant okay I don't do a whole lot in

[04:13:17 - 04:13:23]
here but you can see I do a bit U meta

[04:13:19 - 04:13:27]
has one So Meta AI which is another

[04:13:23 - 04:13:29]
one okay um another one is minstral

[04:13:27 - 04:13:32]
mistal uh

[04:13:29 - 04:13:35]
AI whoops I flipped my mouse over mistal

[04:13:32 - 04:13:38]
AI so here's another one that you might

[04:13:35 - 04:13:39]
not be familiar with okay I'm trying to

[04:13:38 - 04:13:43]
think what other ones there

[04:13:39 - 04:13:45]
are um just a second

[04:13:43 - 04:13:47]
you know what I only missed one and it

[04:13:45 - 04:13:50]
was uh anthropic Claud which by the way

[04:13:47 - 04:13:52]
is like one of the most capable capable

[04:13:50 - 04:13:54]
models at least right now it is so we'll

[04:13:52 - 04:13:56]
just say Claude and we'll have Claude Ai

[04:13:54 - 04:13:57]
and I used to play for Claude and it was

[04:13:56 - 04:14:00]
it's really really good I'm going to see

[04:13:57 - 04:14:01]
if I can go ahead and log in here to to

[04:14:00 - 04:14:04]
get to it here

[04:14:01 - 04:14:05]
today um but obviously like if you have

[04:14:04 - 04:14:08]
paid ones versus free ones you're going

[04:14:05 - 04:14:09]
to get different levels of performance

[04:14:08 - 04:14:11]
okay but I just want to pull them up

[04:14:09 - 04:14:13]
here and so you can see the interfaces

[04:14:11 - 04:14:16]
are uh somewhat similar we'll go ahead

[04:14:13 - 04:14:18]
and try the chat here okay so we'll open

[04:14:16 - 04:14:22]
up mistol mistol

[04:14:18 - 04:14:22]
AI we'll sign in with

[04:14:23 - 04:14:27]
Google and there's probably other AI

[04:14:25 - 04:14:30]
powered assistant out there definitely

[04:14:27 - 04:14:32]
in China they have their own uh China AI

[04:14:30 - 04:14:35]
powered

[04:14:32 - 04:14:37]
assistant not Hospital AI powered

[04:14:35 - 04:14:39]
Hospital that'd be really interesting

[04:14:37 - 04:14:41]
but this is kind of where it's hard to

[04:14:39 - 04:14:43]
um find because if you're not in China

[04:14:41 - 04:14:45]
then you wouldn't necessarily know and

[04:14:43 - 04:14:47]
I'm not even sure how they're accessible

[04:14:45 - 04:14:49]
over here but I know that there is an AI

[04:14:47 - 04:14:51]
power assistant it might be integrated

[04:14:49 - 04:14:54]
into WeChat or Alibaba um but I simply

[04:14:51 - 04:14:55]
don't have access to it right so I I'd

[04:14:54 - 04:14:57]
love to show it and and take a look at

[04:14:55 - 04:15:00]
it but I can't one thing I want to point

[04:14:57 - 04:15:03]
about with meta Ai and Mr AI is that

[04:15:00 - 04:15:05]
these are powered by open source models

[04:15:03 - 04:15:08]
um so with with meta it's probably being

[04:15:05 - 04:15:09]
powered by llama okay so if we go over

[04:15:08 - 04:15:14]
to here this is the open source model

[04:15:09 - 04:15:18]
for U meta Ai and then mistol is powered

[04:15:14 - 04:15:20]
by mistol it say the same name um and so

[04:15:18 - 04:15:22]
you know I don't know what the goal of

[04:15:20 - 04:15:23]
mistol is for their AI powered assistant

[04:15:22 - 04:15:27]
because I don't feel like this is

[04:15:23 - 04:15:28]
something they're trying to offer as um

[04:15:27 - 04:15:31]
as a consumer product it's more like to

[04:15:28 - 04:15:34]
show the capabilities of what mistl can

[04:15:31 - 04:15:36]
do um whereas somebody like Chachi BT

[04:15:34 - 04:15:39]
they want you to pay for it they have

[04:15:36 - 04:15:40]
right now a $20 tier in a $200 tier okay

[04:15:39 - 04:15:42]
and

[04:15:40 - 04:15:43]
Gemini I think they want you to pay for

[04:15:42 - 04:15:45]
this as well

[04:15:43 - 04:15:46]
yeah they have like an upgrade button

[04:15:45 - 04:15:48]
here right and so we can go over to here

[04:15:46 - 04:15:51]
and just take a look at the

[04:15:48 - 04:15:56]
cost um and it's $21 it's always about

[04:15:51 - 04:15:58]
$20 okay but you go to meta Ai and I

[04:15:56 - 04:16:00]
don't think there's anywhere to pay or

[04:15:58 - 04:16:01]
upgrade like here you can store your

[04:16:00 - 04:16:04]
conversation history generate images I'm

[04:16:01 - 04:16:06]
going to go ahead and log into here uh

[04:16:04 - 04:16:09]
we'll log in with Facebook just a

[04:16:06 - 04:16:12]
moment there we go but you know again I

[04:16:09 - 04:16:14]
don't think there's any way to upgrade

[04:16:12 - 04:16:16]
per se right because that's not their

[04:16:14 - 04:16:20]
intention with this thing this thing is

[04:16:16 - 04:16:22]
to demonstrate off um their models llama

[04:16:20 - 04:16:23]
and um I don't think they intend to make

[04:16:22 - 04:16:27]
it a paid thing this is also I think

[04:16:23 - 04:16:29]
integrated into Facebook so um you know

[04:16:27 - 04:16:32]
you're probably using it there uh if you

[04:16:29 - 04:16:33]
ever use it in uh Facebook there um but

[04:16:32 - 04:16:35]
you know the capabilities are just

[04:16:33 - 04:16:38]
different like I find Chachi PT is

[04:16:35 - 04:16:42]
really good at going forever so whatever

[04:16:38 - 04:16:43]
I want to do you know it's like um uh

[04:16:42 - 04:16:46]
you know whatever ever it is it just

[04:16:43 - 04:16:48]
goes and goes and goes and goes um and I

[04:16:46 - 04:16:51]
think what it's doing underneath is that

[04:16:48 - 04:16:53]
constantly summarizing information um so

[04:16:51 - 04:16:55]
I've never I've never experienced a

[04:16:53 - 04:16:57]
point where it said hey you've used up

[04:16:55 - 04:17:00]
your limit except for chat GPT 40 so

[04:16:57 - 04:17:03]
there's different models here so like um

[04:17:00 - 04:17:06]
uh 40 is the latest

[04:17:03 - 04:17:09]
one and oh or maybe it's 01 mini sorry

[04:17:06 - 04:17:11]
it's 01 so 01 these will have a limit uh

[04:17:09 - 04:17:14]
whereas uh 40 it just goes and goes and

[04:17:11 - 04:17:16]
goes there's some other mod like GPT 4

[04:17:14 - 04:17:18]
um and so you know I just find that this

[04:17:16 - 04:17:21]
again if you're doing day-to-day stuff

[04:17:18 - 04:17:22]
it generally works pretty well Gemini

[04:17:21 - 04:17:24]
it's known for being able to parse

[04:17:22 - 04:17:26]
really good documents so maybe we can

[04:17:24 - 04:17:30]
find like a PDF to parse I'm going to

[04:17:26 - 04:17:33]
say uh PDF um white

[04:17:30 - 04:17:35]
paper um Transformers so maybe that's

[04:17:33 - 04:17:37]
something that we could grab so it's

[04:17:35 - 04:17:40]
called the paper all attention is all

[04:17:37 - 04:17:41]
you need right and so maybe what we

[04:17:40 - 04:17:43]
could

[04:17:41 - 04:17:46]
do is down download this and extract out

[04:17:43 - 04:17:48]
the first page so if I go to print here

[04:17:46 - 04:17:50]
I'm on my Windows machine here but I can

[04:17:48 - 04:17:52]
see if I can just save the first page so

[04:17:50 - 04:17:54]
just give me a

[04:17:52 - 04:17:57]
moment okay and so I'm going to drop

[04:17:54 - 04:18:01]
this down say Adobe P PDF and I just

[04:17:57 - 04:18:03]
want um pages one I just want the first

[04:18:01 - 04:18:05]
page and it says it's going to print but

[04:18:03 - 04:18:08]
it's actually going to save

[04:18:05 - 04:18:11]
it okay so I'm saving this to my

[04:18:08 - 04:18:13]
desktop um and I'm just I'm renaming it

[04:18:11 - 04:18:14]
to just attention is all you need or

[04:18:13 - 04:18:17]
just page one I'm going to call it page

[04:18:14 - 04:18:19]
one on my desktop here and so now what

[04:18:17 - 04:18:24]
we can do is we can go ahead and try to

[04:18:19 - 04:18:28]
drop this into um our AI powered

[04:18:24 - 04:18:28]
assistant okay so I'm looking for page

[04:18:29 - 04:18:34]
one all right and so here I'm going to

[04:18:31 - 04:18:36]
try to drop it in it says the page is

[04:18:34 - 04:18:39]
unsupported which to me is unusual I

[04:18:36 - 04:18:41]
thought that Gemini supported PDFs but

[04:18:39 - 04:18:43]
if it dropped down here we have Flash

[04:18:41 - 04:18:44]
and advance so maybe this is something

[04:18:43 - 04:18:47]
that only Advanced can do let's go back

[04:18:44 - 04:18:48]
over to here but I'm told that it's

[04:18:47 - 04:18:51]
really really really good at at

[04:18:48 - 04:18:56]
processing PDFs or docs so we'll just

[04:18:51 - 04:18:56]
take a look here so Gemini Advanced

[04:18:57 - 04:19:01]
PDFs does support PDS if files if you

[04:19:00 - 04:19:02]
put them in a Google Drive and refer

[04:19:01 - 04:19:04]
them by

[04:19:02 - 04:19:08]
name

[04:19:04 - 04:19:09]
okay but is that in the free tier I

[04:19:08 - 04:19:12]
don't know so that's something that I I

[04:19:09 - 04:19:13]
had saw before that was really great um

[04:19:12 - 04:19:16]
but you know you know maybe I can't show

[04:19:13 - 04:19:19]
that here today so that's a little bit

[04:19:16 - 04:19:21]
of a shame if I can't show that um but

[04:19:19 - 04:19:22]
we can upload images so maybe what we

[04:19:21 - 04:19:24]
could

[04:19:22 - 04:19:27]
do well first of all let's just see if

[04:19:24 - 04:19:29]
if chat GPT can handle our PDF and I

[04:19:27 - 04:19:31]
have the paid version so it probably can

[04:19:29 - 04:19:35]
which is probably

[04:19:31 - 04:19:39]
unfair okay so tell me about the PDF it

[04:19:35 - 04:19:39]
probably can handle it no problem

[04:19:46 - 04:19:49]
so it says here however the extracted

[04:19:47 - 04:19:51]
text includes many encoding issues which

[04:19:49 - 04:19:53]
is difficult to read if you if you like

[04:19:51 - 04:19:55]
an attempt to extrap and make more clear

[04:19:53 - 04:19:57]
go for it and so this is something that

[04:19:55 - 04:19:59]
um is a lot of work to set up on your

[04:19:57 - 04:20:00]
own but like if these things can do it

[04:19:59 - 04:20:03]
it makes your life a lot easier but I

[04:20:00 - 04:20:05]
found that I get variable results when

[04:20:03 - 04:20:08]
uh bringing in PDFs now again I'm not

[04:20:05 - 04:20:10]
sure why Gemini is not doing here but

[04:20:08 - 04:20:12]
what we could do as a cheat because it

[04:20:10 - 04:20:14]
can take images is I can try to take a

[04:20:12 - 04:20:16]
screenshot of this and drop it in that

[04:20:14 - 04:20:20]
way so let's see if I if I can do that

[04:20:16 - 04:20:21]
so I'm going to go ahead and um I going

[04:20:20 - 04:20:23]
make the text a little bit large here so

[04:20:21 - 04:20:25]
I can

[04:20:23 - 04:20:27]
see this is really small so I don't

[04:20:25 - 04:20:28]
expect that to work but I'm going to go

[04:20:27 - 04:20:33]
ahead and see if I can paste it in here

[04:20:28 - 04:20:36]
and so can you OCR this for me let's see

[04:20:33 - 04:20:36]
if it's capable of doing

[04:20:37 - 04:20:43]
that and actually it's doing a very very

[04:20:40 - 04:20:44]
good job

[04:20:43 - 04:20:46]
oh look at that it just showed us that

[04:20:44 - 04:20:50]
it was doing it doing it and then it

[04:20:46 - 04:20:50]
decided it couldn't do it that's really

[04:20:53 - 04:20:58]
interesting okay I'll say but I just saw

[04:20:56 - 04:21:02]
you

[04:20:58 - 04:21:02]
OCR and then you

[04:21:06 - 04:21:10]
stopped uh okay how about this we'll go

[04:21:08 - 04:21:14]
back and try that

[04:21:10 - 04:21:16]
again can you extract the text out of

[04:21:14 - 04:21:16]
this

[04:21:19 - 04:21:23]
image yeah so there it's doing it

[04:21:23 - 04:21:28]
right what that's crazy it you it

[04:21:26 - 04:21:31]
totally did it

[04:21:28 - 04:21:35]
again so that's kind of uh kind of odd

[04:21:31 - 04:21:37]
but whatever let's go over to here and

[04:21:35 - 04:21:38]
um I don't know if we can upload it said

[04:21:37 - 04:21:40]
over here we should be able to upload

[04:21:38 - 04:21:44]
images

[04:21:40 - 04:21:49]
right um maybe can imagine an image

[04:21:44 - 04:21:54]
right so you know can you tell me about

[04:21:49 - 04:21:54]
uh attention is all you

[04:21:58 - 04:22:02]
need all right and so it's outputting

[04:22:00 - 04:22:06]
some results here we'll make our way

[04:22:02 - 04:22:09]
over to mistol it can search the web oh

[04:22:06 - 04:22:11]
that's cool what's

[04:22:09 - 04:22:13]
canvas what is that I don't even know

[04:22:11 - 04:22:15]
what that is Mr

[04:22:13 - 04:22:18]
AI canvas let's take a look

[04:22:15 - 04:22:19]
here a new interface that pops up in the

[04:22:18 - 04:22:21]
chat window when you need to go beyond

[04:22:19 - 04:22:23]
confirmations into

[04:22:21 - 04:22:27]
idealization oh

[04:22:23 - 04:22:30]
okay um so let's see those capabilities

[04:22:27 - 04:22:33]
here maybe that's just like side

[04:22:30 - 04:22:36]
windows so that's the web search this is

[04:22:33 - 04:22:36]
what we want to see

[04:22:38 - 04:22:43]
here um okay yeah so canvas is the same

[04:22:41 - 04:22:46]
thing as what CLA has where they have

[04:22:43 - 04:22:48]
like pop out windows um but here we can

[04:22:46 - 04:22:49]
upload a PDF I believe let's go give

[04:22:48 - 04:22:54]
that a

[04:22:49 - 04:22:56]
go can you get the text from this PDF

[04:22:54 - 04:22:56]
see if we can handle

[04:22:58 - 04:23:04]
that it's really interesting it's saying

[04:23:01 - 04:23:06]
it's garbled right

[04:23:04 - 04:23:09]
um would you like me able provide

[04:23:06 - 04:23:10]
cleaner P yep do it okay we'll go ahead

[04:23:09 - 04:23:13]
and do that again I'm not paying for

[04:23:10 - 04:23:15]
Claud here but uh

[04:23:13 - 04:23:19]
I like that this was in here before so

[04:23:15 - 04:23:19]
that might be nice to try that out later

[04:23:23 - 04:23:27]
on technical passage that explains the

[04:23:25 - 04:23:28]
thing unfortunately much of the text is

[04:23:27 - 04:23:30]
corrupted so it's really interesting

[04:23:28 - 04:23:32]
that it's not able to handle it but

[04:23:30 - 04:23:33]
Gemini I definitely think if we had the

[04:23:32 - 04:23:35]
advanced version it would probably let

[04:23:33 - 04:23:40]
us do it I think they might be gaing

[04:23:35 - 04:23:42]
that feature uh over there um and then

[04:23:40 - 04:23:45]
here we can attach a PDF as as well so

[04:23:42 - 04:23:47]
let's go ahead here and say like can you

[04:23:45 - 04:23:49]
can you get the

[04:23:47 - 04:23:51]
text from this

[04:23:49 - 04:23:55]
PDF

[04:23:51 - 04:23:55]
okay and we'll see what it

[04:24:00 - 04:24:04]
does and so this one's reading it it's

[04:24:03 - 04:24:07]
not complaining right it's just doing it

[04:24:04 - 04:24:07]
so that's really

[04:24:09 - 04:24:14]
good okay so you know this isn't a great

[04:24:12 - 04:24:17]
example of of comparisons but I just

[04:24:14 - 04:24:19]
wanted you to get an idea that there are

[04:24:17 - 04:24:22]
these ones out here that we have Chachi

[04:24:19 - 04:24:25]
BT we have Gemini we have meta we have

[04:24:22 - 04:24:26]
mistol we have Claude um and we're going

[04:24:25 - 04:24:28]
to just keep revisiting these things I

[04:24:26 - 04:24:30]
might actually have a better example

[04:24:28 - 04:24:33]
that we'll walk through later but this

[04:24:30 - 04:24:35]
is just an introduction to these things

[04:24:33 - 04:24:37]
some are paid some have paid tiar some

[04:24:35 - 04:24:40]
will not have paid tiers and their

[04:24:37 - 04:24:41]
purposes are different okay so I'll see

[04:24:40 - 04:24:46]
you in the next one ciao

[04:24:41 - 04:24:48]
[Music]

[04:24:46 - 04:24:50]
hey this is Andrew Brown and I want to

[04:24:48 - 04:24:53]
show you a bunch of places where you can

[04:24:50 - 04:24:54]
run Jupiter notebooks in the cloud uh

[04:24:53 - 04:24:55]
maybe in a separate video we might show

[04:24:54 - 04:24:57]
you how to do it locally but I just want

[04:24:55 - 04:24:59]
to focus on cloud Solutions so that you

[04:24:57 - 04:25:02]
have many many options where you can run

[04:24:59 - 04:25:03]
this um so you know one that we can

[04:25:02 - 04:25:06]
absolutely run is Google code lab which

[04:25:03 - 04:25:09]
you we will see time and time and again

[04:25:06 - 04:25:12]
so um Google cab is just free CPUs and

[04:25:09 - 04:25:14]
gpus so I made my way over to Google cab

[04:25:12 - 04:25:16]
I logged in the Google account I can

[04:25:14 - 04:25:17]
create a new notebook here and we're not

[04:25:16 - 04:25:19]
going to do anything fancy I'm just

[04:25:17 - 04:25:20]
going to just show you something very

[04:25:19 - 04:25:22]
simple so like let's say we want to

[04:25:20 - 04:25:25]
check what version of python we're using

[04:25:22 - 04:25:28]
we could type in was it python hyen hyen

[04:25:25 - 04:25:30]
version here and run

[04:25:28 - 04:25:32]
it okay and we'll give it a moment to

[04:25:30 - 04:25:34]
execute not sure why it's super slow

[04:25:32 - 04:25:37]
here but it will work in just a

[04:25:34 - 04:25:39]
moment and I need double percentage

[04:25:37 - 04:25:44]
sorry double

[04:25:39 - 04:25:44]
percentage give it a moment there

[04:25:47 - 04:25:52]
okay and so that is an option we have

[04:25:49 - 04:25:56]
now could we upgrade this and get more

[04:25:52 - 04:25:58]
computes there is a collap pro so you

[04:25:56 - 04:26:01]
know it looks like for $ 13.99 you can

[04:25:58 - 04:26:05]
get 100 compute units per month collab

[04:26:01 - 04:26:07]
Pro Plus you get 500 compute uh uh units

[04:26:05 - 04:26:09]
per month I don't personally

[04:26:07 - 04:26:11]
know what compute is being used

[04:26:09 - 04:26:13]
underneath I simply could not find it

[04:26:11 - 04:26:14]
but it seems to work fine it's some it's

[04:26:13 - 04:26:16]
going to be something underneath I'm not

[04:26:14 - 04:26:18]
sure but Google collab is something that

[04:26:16 - 04:26:20]
you'll see time and time and again

[04:26:18 - 04:26:21]
because there will just be examples

[04:26:20 - 04:26:22]
places like I'll give you an example if

[04:26:21 - 04:26:24]
we go to

[04:26:22 - 04:26:26]
Omni or maybe we'll just type in like

[04:26:24 - 04:26:27]
Google

[04:26:26 - 04:26:30]
collab

[04:26:27 - 04:26:32]
examples notebooks um somewhere like

[04:26:30 - 04:26:35]
hugging

[04:26:32 - 04:26:39]
face because people will

[04:26:35 - 04:26:40]
often have examples you'll see like a

[04:26:39 - 04:26:42]
button that says this is hard to see but

[04:26:40 - 04:26:44]
if we go a little bit closer here here

[04:26:42 - 04:26:46]
you'll see we have the the button here

[04:26:44 - 04:26:47]
which is collab this one looks like

[04:26:46 - 04:26:49]
maybe sagemaker Studio which we might

[04:26:47 - 04:26:51]
want to show here in just a moment but

[04:26:49 - 04:26:53]
I'll open this up here and so this is

[04:26:51 - 04:26:56]
someone else's collab and so like I can

[04:26:53 - 04:26:58]
run this one right I can go ahead and

[04:26:56 - 04:27:00]
just start running it it says this is

[04:26:58 - 04:27:02]
someone else's notebook and say run

[04:27:00 - 04:27:04]
anyway and right now saying too many

[04:27:02 - 04:27:07]
sessions because I have this one open

[04:27:04 - 04:27:09]
here I don't know exactly how to manage

[04:27:07 - 04:27:11]
sessions um normally when I'm running

[04:27:09 - 04:27:14]
this I'm always running one at a time

[04:27:11 - 04:27:16]
but uh there's be some way to stop it or

[04:27:14 - 04:27:17]
oh here it is manage sessions we'll go

[04:27:16 - 04:27:19]
here and so here you can see we have a

[04:27:17 - 04:27:22]
few from before so I'll go ahead and

[04:27:19 - 04:27:23]
I'll just delete them okay yeah

[04:27:22 - 04:27:25]
terminate terminate terminate so these

[04:27:23 - 04:27:28]
are all being terminated so now if I go

[04:27:25 - 04:27:29]
back over to this one now I can probably

[04:27:28 - 04:27:33]
run

[04:27:29 - 04:27:34]
it okay I'm not that interested in um uh

[04:27:33 - 04:27:36]
actually utilizing this I just want to

[04:27:34 - 04:27:38]
show you that I'm using an external

[04:27:36 - 04:27:39]
notebook right so there it's running I'm

[04:27:38 - 04:27:41]
sure it will work I'm going to go ahead

[04:27:39 - 04:27:43]
and go to manage uh sessions I'm going

[04:27:41 - 04:27:45]
to go ahead and terminate that okay this

[04:27:43 - 04:27:47]
one's working totally fine so this is

[04:27:45 - 04:27:49]
one uh place that we can use it now it

[04:27:47 - 04:27:50]
has its own little experience uh that

[04:27:49 - 04:27:52]
that looks a lot different I personally

[04:27:50 - 04:27:55]
don't like cab compared to other tools

[04:27:52 - 04:27:56]
out there but this one is so popular um

[04:27:55 - 04:27:58]
that you're going to run into it a lot

[04:27:56 - 04:27:59]
so you want to get familiar with that

[04:27:58 - 04:28:00]
the other one is stagemaker studio lab

[04:27:59 - 04:28:02]
so I'm going to go ahead and type in

[04:28:00 - 04:28:05]
stagemaker studio

[04:28:02 - 04:28:08]
Labs now there's stagemaker Studio which

[04:28:05 - 04:28:12]
is something else but Stage Studio Labs

[04:28:08 - 04:28:14]
is um it's like it has free compute and

[04:28:12 - 04:28:16]
gpus I'm not even sure if they have a

[04:28:14 - 04:28:17]
paid tier I think it's just free um and

[04:28:16 - 04:28:20]
so this is something you have to sign up

[04:28:17 - 04:28:22]
and request um so I have an account let

[04:28:20 - 04:28:23]
me go ahead and grab it just a moment

[04:28:22 - 04:28:25]
here as I log

[04:28:23 - 04:28:28]
in

[04:28:25 - 04:28:29]
okay so I'm just trying to log in but

[04:28:28 - 04:28:31]
this is one thing they make you do is a

[04:28:29 - 04:28:34]
lot of these tear things I think the

[04:28:31 - 04:28:36]
reason why is that a lot of these

[04:28:34 - 04:28:38]
um

[04:28:36 - 04:28:40]
um choose all the chairs that was

[04:28:38 - 04:28:42]
correct choose all the beds but a lot of

[04:28:40 - 04:28:44]
these uh tools here they get abused by

[04:28:42 - 04:28:46]
uh crypto Miner so I think that they

[04:28:44 - 04:28:48]
just put some extra excess here to get

[04:28:46 - 04:28:50]
in here and I got my password wrong it's

[04:28:48 - 04:28:51]
cuz I'm typing in my uh my password

[04:28:50 - 04:28:53]
manager is not working right now so I

[04:28:51 - 04:28:54]
have to manually type it just give me

[04:28:53 - 04:28:56]
another second here to try try to type

[04:28:54 - 04:28:58]
this in again there you go I had to

[04:28:56 - 04:28:59]
reset my password but now I am in and so

[04:28:58 - 04:29:01]
this experience is a little bit

[04:28:59 - 04:29:04]
different you have two options CPUs and

[04:29:01 - 04:29:06]
gpus and so depending on what you choose

[04:29:04 - 04:29:08]
is what you're going to have um and you

[04:29:06 - 04:29:10]
can see here that if you choose CPUs

[04:29:08 - 04:29:12]
you'll have it up to four uh four hours

[04:29:10 - 04:29:14]
at a time with a limit of 8 hours for 20

[04:29:12 - 04:29:15]
periods or that time is half for four

[04:29:14 - 04:29:19]
hours in a 24hour period if you're

[04:29:15 - 04:29:21]
running gpus so this is another uh great

[04:29:19 - 04:29:23]
thing that we can utilize and I do

[04:29:21 - 04:29:26]
believe that they have some uh examples

[04:29:23 - 04:29:28]
here so if we were to go over to uh this

[04:29:26 - 04:29:30]
tab here I

[04:29:28 - 04:29:32]
believe nope nope nope nope but I think

[04:29:30 - 04:29:33]
that we first launched it up there are

[04:29:32 - 04:29:35]
some examples let's go ahead and just

[04:29:33 - 04:29:37]
start it anyway I'm just going to use

[04:29:35 - 04:29:39]
CPUs here today and so it's going to

[04:29:37 - 04:29:40]
bring up the runtime uh it say something

[04:29:39 - 04:29:43]
went wrong which is totally fine so I'm

[04:29:40 - 04:29:45]
going to just choose some hats here here

[04:29:43 - 04:29:47]
and it says uh please allow the script

[04:29:45 - 04:29:49]
downloading from the domain refresh your

[04:29:47 - 04:29:51]
page for more access and today it's just

[04:29:49 - 04:29:54]
we're getting a lot of trouble and it

[04:29:51 - 04:29:59]
logged me out wow okay so what a

[04:29:54 - 04:30:03]
headache let try this again here

[04:29:59 - 04:30:03]
and I think it just doesn't like me here

[04:30:05 - 04:30:09]
today please allow the script from

[04:30:07 - 04:30:13]
downloading from this here

[04:30:09 - 04:30:13]
today that's a new error

[04:30:14 - 04:30:17]
[Music]

[04:30:18 - 04:30:21]
there it contains a description if you

[04:30:20 - 04:30:24]
can access your account verify that

[04:30:21 - 04:30:24]
you're using the correct email and

[04:30:27 - 04:30:31]
password uh yeah there's nothing that

[04:30:29 - 04:30:34]
should be causing

[04:30:31 - 04:30:36]
this I do have a username as well so I

[04:30:34 - 04:30:41]
could try

[04:30:36 - 04:30:41]
that and one second here

[04:30:42 - 04:30:44]
nope so I can't use it here today but

[04:30:43 - 04:30:48]
it's pretty straightforward you have

[04:30:44 - 04:30:49]
CPUs or gpus and you launch it up um

[04:30:48 - 04:30:51]
just give me another second let's see if

[04:30:49 - 04:30:53]
I can fix this so what it's saying here

[04:30:51 - 04:30:54]
is that I need to accept davis. Waf as

[04:30:53 - 04:30:58]
The Trusted domain I'm not even sure how

[04:30:54 - 04:30:59]
to do that um to allow the JavaScript as

[04:30:58 - 04:31:02]
a trusted domain for more information

[04:30:59 - 04:31:03]
see W firewall manager but this makes no

[04:31:02 - 04:31:07]
sense because I'm not logging into my

[04:31:03 - 04:31:09]
AIS account right it's not it's not

[04:31:07 - 04:31:12]
related so just give me a moment okay

[04:31:09 - 04:31:13]
and here again it's saying uh if you're

[04:31:12 - 04:31:14]
using a browse security plugin that

[04:31:13 - 04:31:16]
prevents Javascript download you may

[04:31:14 - 04:31:18]
need to see this error so maybe there's

[04:31:16 - 04:31:20]
something that's preventing it let me go

[04:31:18 - 04:31:23]
figure that out all right so um I asked

[04:31:20 - 04:31:25]
uh I gave um the information to Claude

[04:31:23 - 04:31:27]
it's like go to here into your Chrome

[04:31:25 - 04:31:29]
settings and add this here seems silly

[04:31:27 - 04:31:31]
that I would even have to do this but um

[04:31:29 - 04:31:33]
you know maybe this could be something

[04:31:31 - 04:31:34]
that might fix it but also says in the

[04:31:33 - 04:31:36]
padlock and site settings maybe there's

[04:31:34 - 04:31:39]
JavaScript options there so maybe I'll

[04:31:36 - 04:31:41]
check that first

[04:31:39 - 04:31:42]
um site settings oh so we have it here

[04:31:41 - 04:31:45]
as well

[04:31:42 - 04:31:48]
okay so that is a a direct way to here

[04:31:45 - 04:31:49]
um and it says allow so it's set to

[04:31:48 - 04:31:54]
allow there's

[04:31:49 - 04:31:56]
no reason why it would not allow that um

[04:31:54 - 04:31:59]
so I'll go back over to

[04:31:56 - 04:32:01]
here it says that it's allowed here as

[04:31:59 - 04:32:05]
well um but I'll go ahead and I'll just

[04:32:01 - 04:32:07]
add this like this because now it should

[04:32:05 - 04:32:08]
fully allow it no matter what let's see

[04:32:07 - 04:32:12]
if I sign in

[04:32:08 - 04:32:14]
here did that fix my problem I'm seen

[04:32:12 - 04:32:16]
bags I hate this bag thing but I I get

[04:32:14 - 04:32:18]
it they uh they don't want to deal with

[04:32:16 - 04:32:20]
um these folks that are abusing it so

[04:32:18 - 04:32:21]
now I'm in here we'll go ahead and try

[04:32:20 - 04:32:23]
this

[04:32:21 - 04:32:25]
again there might be something funny

[04:32:23 - 04:32:26]
with my browser like I'm even having

[04:32:25 - 04:32:30]
trouble getting to dash lane these days

[04:32:26 - 04:32:31]
so um uh boo my co-founder was here

[04:32:30 - 04:32:33]
helping configure something maybe he's

[04:32:31 - 04:32:36]
changed something on my computer um but

[04:32:33 - 04:32:37]
anyway let's see if this go goes ahead

[04:32:36 - 04:32:39]
and launches up it looks like it's

[04:32:37 - 04:32:40]
working so we'll just wait a little bit

[04:32:39 - 04:32:42]
and so now that it's running we'll go

[04:32:40 - 04:32:43]
ahead and open the project but but I

[04:32:42 - 04:32:45]
kind of remember there being existing

[04:32:43 - 04:32:48]
notebooks in here so I think that we'll

[04:32:45 - 04:32:49]
have something to play around with here

[04:32:48 - 04:32:51]
um if we don't even have anything yes we

[04:32:49 - 04:32:52]
do and whoever wrote These they did a

[04:32:51 - 04:32:55]
really good job because I really really

[04:32:52 - 04:32:58]
like them um they should have ones in

[04:32:55 - 04:33:00]
here for um maybe if we launched up the

[04:32:58 - 04:33:02]
gpus I think the repo is different but

[04:33:00 - 04:33:03]
if we launched up gpus I think we

[04:33:02 - 04:33:05]
actually would have had some large

[04:33:03 - 04:33:06]
language models we could run there this

[04:33:05 - 04:33:08]
one's pretty simple so we'll go into

[04:33:06 - 04:33:10]
gradio as an example we'll click into

[04:33:08 - 04:33:12]
this one and we'll select the default

[04:33:10 - 04:33:13]
kernel here

[04:33:12 - 04:33:16]
looks like there's one specifically for

[04:33:13 - 04:33:20]
mistol which is cool and so this one is

[04:33:16 - 04:33:22]
setting up an interface to greet um so

[04:33:20 - 04:33:24]
I'm going to go ahead and just run all

[04:33:22 - 04:33:27]
here yeah restart the kernel but this is

[04:33:24 - 04:33:29]
your standard um notebook Jupiter

[04:33:27 - 04:33:32]
notebook experience

[04:33:29 - 04:33:34]
right nothing super fancy here so here

[04:33:32 - 04:33:35]
it has one little problem says unknown

[04:33:34 - 04:33:38]
module named

[04:33:35 - 04:33:41]
gradio why would it be unknown you you

[04:33:38 - 04:33:42]
import it right there and that's totally

[04:33:41 - 04:33:43]
fine like I'm not sure how

[04:33:42 - 04:33:44]
wellmaintained these are but I'm going

[04:33:43 - 04:33:46]
to go ahead and drag this all the way to

[04:33:44 - 04:33:49]
the top it could also be just the the

[04:33:46 - 04:33:51]
environment that I chose so I go down

[04:33:49 - 04:33:52]
below so this one's probably better so

[04:33:51 - 04:33:54]
we go ahead and do this

[04:33:52 - 04:33:56]
one it does say that we had to use this

[04:33:54 - 04:33:58]
one but it it might be the case and so

[04:33:56 - 04:33:59]
we're restarting the kernel here notice

[04:33:58 - 04:34:01]
you can see the dot here it'll tell you

[04:33:59 - 04:34:04]
if it restarted up here it will give you

[04:34:01 - 04:34:05]
information down below about restart um

[04:34:04 - 04:34:07]
I think it's restarted I think it was

[04:34:05 - 04:34:10]
really fast we'll go ahead and hit

[04:34:07 - 04:34:13]
restart and run it and so now it might

[04:34:10 - 04:34:14]
work no problem

[04:34:13 - 04:34:16]
and so here we might had to change

[04:34:14 - 04:34:17]
something it's still saying no gradio

[04:34:16 - 04:34:20]
you can access gradio with the following

[04:34:17 - 04:34:21]
Link in your own uh domain

[04:34:20 - 04:34:24]
[Music]

[04:34:21 - 04:34:25]
M okay but it's still saying there's no

[04:34:24 - 04:34:29]
gradio let's go drop this down and take

[04:34:25 - 04:34:30]
a look again here oh gradio example so

[04:34:29 - 04:34:33]
they actually have a specific kernel for

[04:34:30 - 04:34:34]
gradio and that might be might have been

[04:34:33 - 04:34:36]
our issue here I'll go ahead and just

[04:34:34 - 04:34:38]
run this

[04:34:36 - 04:34:42]
one that doesn't work I can go up the

[04:34:38 - 04:34:42]
top here and say restart kernel

[04:34:42 - 04:34:46]
sometimes that might help it still says

[04:34:45 - 04:34:50]
Sage maker

[04:34:46 - 04:34:54]
distribution no no I want to be

[04:34:50 - 04:34:54]
in this one

[04:34:55 - 04:35:02]
select and we'll restart the

[04:35:00 - 04:35:05]
kernel I don't think it's listening to

[04:35:02 - 04:35:07]
me it's not but that's fine what I can

[04:35:05 - 04:35:09]
do to get this working and we're going

[04:35:07 - 04:35:11]
to be using gradio later on so this this

[04:35:09 - 04:35:12]
is not not a waste of time I'm going to

[04:35:11 - 04:35:14]
go p install gradio and see if I can

[04:35:12 - 04:35:16]
just install gradio this

[04:35:14 - 04:35:20]
way now I might want other things

[04:35:16 - 04:35:21]
installed but um the kernel like that

[04:35:20 - 04:35:23]
can have pre-installed stuff and so for

[04:35:21 - 04:35:24]
whatever reason I'm having a hard time

[04:35:23 - 04:35:26]
switching it here

[04:35:24 - 04:35:28]
today I just don't feel like um

[04:35:26 - 04:35:31]
stressing out about

[04:35:28 - 04:35:32]
it there's that environment. yaml file

[04:35:31 - 04:35:35]
so maybe that would set up stuff I don't

[04:35:32 - 04:35:38]
know but we'll go ahead and run this and

[04:35:35 - 04:35:38]
see if that

[04:35:38 - 04:35:42]
works okay this is what you have to do

[04:35:41 - 04:35:45]
on a regular basis when working on AI

[04:35:42 - 04:35:48]
projects fiddling with these kind of

[04:35:45 - 04:35:51]
things so it's going to start the

[04:35:48 - 04:35:52]
demo to create a public link sets shared

[04:35:51 - 04:35:55]
to

[04:35:52 - 04:35:59]
True um I just want to see this working

[04:35:55 - 04:36:01]
somewhere let's go down below

[04:35:59 - 04:36:03]
here so here it's suggesting that I

[04:36:01 - 04:36:06]
might be able to access this I didn't

[04:36:03 - 04:36:09]
set it to True did I

[04:36:06 - 04:36:11]
not but anyway it's just saying let's go

[04:36:09 - 04:36:13]
grab this link up here at the top so I'm

[04:36:11 - 04:36:15]
going to grab this here for just a

[04:36:13 - 04:36:18]
second I'm going to go over to here and

[04:36:15 - 04:36:21]
I'm just going to replace a bunch of the

[04:36:18 - 04:36:22]
stuff by the way again this is just free

[04:36:21 - 04:36:24]
so there's no there's no harm in you

[04:36:22 - 04:36:26]
running this um I'm going go ahead and

[04:36:24 - 04:36:28]
run this and see if that works and so

[04:36:26 - 04:36:33]
now I have gradio so I just say

[04:36:28 - 04:36:35]
hello uh there we go hello submit and it

[04:36:33 - 04:36:37]
outputs hello hello I think I supposed

[04:36:35 - 04:36:40]
to say my name Andrew right and so

[04:36:37 - 04:36:43]
that's a very simple um gradio example

[04:36:40 - 04:36:45]
now we were seeing before on um hugging

[04:36:43 - 04:36:47]
face there was a button to click I I've

[04:36:45 - 04:36:49]
never seen a sagemaker Labs like that

[04:36:47 - 04:36:50]
before so I wouldn't mind trying I'm

[04:36:49 - 04:36:52]
going to go ahead and I don't want to

[04:36:50 - 04:36:54]
log out I just want to stop this

[04:36:52 - 04:36:58]
environment

[04:36:54 - 04:37:01]
so um I'm going close this

[04:36:58 - 04:37:04]
tab right we'll hit stop but you could

[04:37:01 - 04:37:06]
see with uh Google cab you want to stop

[04:37:04 - 04:37:07]
the sessions with this one you want to

[04:37:06 - 04:37:09]
go and you want to manually hit that

[04:37:07 - 04:37:11]
stop button right you don't want to end

[04:37:09 - 04:37:13]
up using your CPUs if you come back back

[04:37:11 - 04:37:14]
later in the day you won't have any so

[04:37:13 - 04:37:17]
make sure you stop them not going to

[04:37:14 - 04:37:20]
cost you anything but there we go you

[04:37:17 - 04:37:23]
can see I have a lot more time left over

[04:37:20 - 04:37:24]
let's go over to uh here and I'm going

[04:37:23 - 04:37:28]
to go ahead and just click one of these

[04:37:24 - 04:37:28]
like a I don't want anything

[04:37:28 - 04:37:34]
complicated let's do this one here this

[04:37:30 - 04:37:36]
sounds very simple and so this is now uh

[04:37:34 - 04:37:38]
setting the options here down below it's

[04:37:36 - 04:37:43]
showing us what it

[04:37:38 - 04:37:46]
has okay does it need CPUs or GP I don't

[04:37:43 - 04:37:48]
know um it's not saying what it is since

[04:37:46 - 04:37:50]
it's doing like sequencing I think this

[04:37:48 - 04:37:52]
is probably just require CPU so if I hit

[04:37:50 - 04:37:53]
runtime I'm going to assume that it's

[04:37:52 - 04:37:55]
going to launch this notebook again I've

[04:37:53 - 04:37:58]
never done this this way before so

[04:37:55 - 04:38:00]
curious to see what happens oh that's a

[04:37:58 - 04:38:02]
chair there

[04:38:00 - 04:38:06]
oh dear oh I missed a chair right there

[04:38:02 - 04:38:09]
there we go now we have to do the hats

[04:38:06 - 04:38:12]
you can see collab is a lot less

[04:38:09 - 04:38:14]
annoying did I is that that a hat

[04:38:12 - 04:38:16]
doesn't even look like a

[04:38:14 - 04:38:18]
hat all the

[04:38:16 - 04:38:20]
bags it's almost not even worth it for

[04:38:18 - 04:38:23]
the free compute here but you do get

[04:38:20 - 04:38:25]
gpus which is nice so we'll just give

[04:38:23 - 04:38:27]
that a moment to spin

[04:38:25 - 04:38:31]
up

[04:38:27 - 04:38:34]
okay here we go so it started so now we

[04:38:31 - 04:38:36]
copy to project the button and then I

[04:38:34 - 04:38:38]
assume it's just going to import the uh

[04:38:36 - 04:38:43]
the get repo there so clone entire repo

[04:38:38 - 04:38:44]
sure we clone it and and um it's a

[04:38:43 - 04:38:45]
little bit unusual where it's going I'm

[04:38:44 - 04:38:49]
not sure where it's placing it but if we

[04:38:45 - 04:38:49]
go to the top level maybe it's somewhere

[04:38:50 - 04:38:55]
here yeah I'm not sure where it's

[04:38:53 - 04:38:57]
going all it's doing is running uh get

[04:38:55 - 04:38:58]
cloned in the repo okay great so now

[04:38:57 - 04:39:01]
it's taking

[04:38:58 - 04:39:02]
over um so yeah now the notebook is here

[04:39:01 - 04:39:06]
I

[04:39:02 - 04:39:08]
guess so maybe it was in here okay so it

[04:39:06 - 04:39:10]
actually imported a bunch of stuff so I

[04:39:08 - 04:39:11]
was hoping that it was bringing one

[04:39:10 - 04:39:14]
specific one to here but it actually

[04:39:11 - 04:39:16]
brought a lot of stuff in here so I'm

[04:39:14 - 04:39:18]
not really sure what library we were

[04:39:16 - 04:39:21]
trying to run but here's an example of

[04:39:18 - 04:39:24]
Sid kit um and that's doing something

[04:39:21 - 04:39:27]
not necessarily what we want to do but

[04:39:24 - 04:39:29]
uh lots and lots of examples yeah that

[04:39:27 - 04:39:33]
is sagemaker studio lab so that is

[04:39:29 - 04:39:36]
another option U that you have available

[04:39:33 - 04:39:38]
to you okay so we'll take a look at

[04:39:36 - 04:39:42]
another one

[04:39:38 - 04:39:44]
[Music]

[04:39:42 - 04:39:46]
so where else can we run uh notebooks

[04:39:44 - 04:39:48]
well if we're in ads we can just log

[04:39:46 - 04:39:51]
into that and I can show you how to run

[04:39:48 - 04:39:52]
it directly in your ads account um

[04:39:51 - 04:39:55]
actually iTab us does come with a free

[04:39:52 - 04:39:57]
tier uh for compute for ML M3 larges or

[04:39:55 - 04:39:59]
whatever so I'm going to go ahead and

[04:39:57 - 04:40:04]
just log in just give me one moment all

[04:39:59 - 04:40:05]
right so now I'm signed into um AWS and

[04:40:04 - 04:40:07]
so I'm going to make my way over to Sage

[04:40:05 - 04:40:09]
maker just double checking my cost

[04:40:07 - 04:40:11]
nothing nothing too crazy here on

[04:40:09 - 04:40:13]
September 24th yeah that was a high day

[04:40:11 - 04:40:15]
uh months away months ago but that's

[04:40:13 - 04:40:18]
okay so I'm going to make my way over to

[04:40:15 - 04:40:18]
Sage

[04:40:19 - 04:40:26]
maker okay uh Amazon sagemaker AI oh did

[04:40:23 - 04:40:27]
they rename it now already it's been

[04:40:26 - 04:40:28]
renamed oh well let's go over there

[04:40:27 - 04:40:31]
that's

[04:40:28 - 04:40:33]
fine whatever AWS you can put AI in

[04:40:31 - 04:40:35]
front of it if you want I don't care and

[04:40:33 - 04:40:36]
so the way this works is you would have

[04:40:35 - 04:40:38]
to normally set up a domain like I

[04:40:36 - 04:40:39]
already have one set up here so I guess

[04:40:38 - 04:40:41]
I could delete

[04:40:39 - 04:40:43]
it um

[04:40:41 - 04:40:44]
but the idea is that you pretty much go

[04:40:43 - 04:40:46]
over I'm just going to go to another

[04:40:44 - 04:40:48]
region it's so hard to show this again

[04:40:46 - 04:40:52]
and again and again but I'm going to go

[04:40:48 - 04:40:54]
to let's say

[04:40:52 - 04:40:57]
Oregon

[04:40:54 - 04:40:58]
okay and what you would do is you go to

[04:40:57 - 04:41:01]
getting

[04:40:58 - 04:41:02]
started and they have like set up

[04:41:01 - 04:41:05]
stagemaker domain so this is the one

[04:41:02 - 04:41:06]
that you would choose and that will set

[04:41:05 - 04:41:08]
you up a bunch of stuff it takes a

[04:41:06 - 04:41:10]
little bit of time but I already have

[04:41:08 - 04:41:13]
one set up and I'm not going to set it

[04:41:10 - 04:41:16]
up like 100 times over here

[04:41:13 - 04:41:19]
um and so we'll go over to here back to

[04:41:16 - 04:41:22]
the main Sage maker and oh do I not have

[04:41:19 - 04:41:24]
one set up here oh I do and so once it's

[04:41:22 - 04:41:25]
set up if you go to Studio here you can

[04:41:24 - 04:41:27]
open up the studio now there are

[04:41:25 - 04:41:28]
notebooks here but I thought they're

[04:41:27 - 04:41:30]
getting rid of

[04:41:28 - 04:41:32]
these but the experience looks a little

[04:41:30 - 04:41:34]
bit new so I'm not sure it says try the

[04:41:32 - 04:41:35]
new Jupiter lab and sui maker studio so

[04:41:34 - 04:41:36]
they're they're not suggesting you to

[04:41:35 - 04:41:38]
use these anymore they don't really want

[04:41:36 - 04:41:40]
you to use this they want you to open up

[04:41:38 - 04:41:43]
sag Maker Now I want to point out that

[04:41:40 - 04:41:44]
do not launch sagemaker canvas this one

[04:41:43 - 04:41:47]
has a similar experience this one's

[04:41:44 - 04:41:49]
expensive do not use sagemaker canvas it

[04:41:47 - 04:41:51]
is awful awful awful at least at this

[04:41:49 - 04:41:54]
time uh it is in terms of showing you

[04:41:51 - 04:41:56]
spend the service isn't bad it's just

[04:41:54 - 04:41:57]
it's just a spend trap but now we're in

[04:41:56 - 04:41:59]
stagemaker studio in the top left corner

[04:41:57 - 04:42:01]
we're going to go to jupyter lab we can

[04:41:59 - 04:42:03]
go and create a new jupyter lab uh space

[04:42:01 - 04:42:05]
I'm going to call it example as as we

[04:42:03 - 04:42:06]
can name it whatever we want we're going

[04:42:05 - 04:42:09]
to create that

[04:42:06 - 04:42:12]
space I'm going to get that pop out of

[04:42:09 - 04:42:15]
the way and uh we have some options here

[04:42:12 - 04:42:17]
the ml uh T3 medium has a generous free

[04:42:15 - 04:42:19]
tier um I would double check the pricing

[04:42:17 - 04:42:21]
there because you could be outside of

[04:42:19 - 04:42:23]
free tier if it's outside the year or

[04:42:21 - 04:42:29]
something like that so just look at sag

[04:42:23 - 04:42:31]
maker sag maker Studio pricing um uh

[04:42:29 - 04:42:33]
Jupiter

[04:42:31 - 04:42:35]
lab and so we go over here we see runp

[04:42:33 - 04:42:38]
pods trying to buy ad space above them

[04:42:35 - 04:42:43]
there we'll go and scroll on

[04:42:38 - 04:42:43]
down and so it's the MLT three

[04:42:44 - 04:42:51]
ml maybe Sage maker free tier Sage

[04:42:48 - 04:42:54]
maker free

[04:42:51 - 04:42:54]
tier

[04:43:00 - 04:43:06]
AWS and

[04:43:03 - 04:43:08]
so sagemaker notebook so 250 hours of ml

[04:43:06 - 04:43:12]
medium

[04:43:08 - 04:43:13]
3 it's free TI per month for the first

[04:43:12 - 04:43:15]
two months for the first two months so

[04:43:13 - 04:43:17]
if you want to utilize this compute make

[04:43:15 - 04:43:19]
a new account you'll get that reset

[04:43:17 - 04:43:21]
there um or you might be outside the

[04:43:19 - 04:43:22]
free tier but I remember this not being

[04:43:21 - 04:43:24]
very expensive like it was in the

[04:43:22 - 04:43:27]
pennies but if you forgot about it it

[04:43:24 - 04:43:29]
might cost you 60 bucks or 35 bucks for

[04:43:27 - 04:43:31]
the month so just be careful there and

[04:43:29 - 04:43:33]
you could look up the exact cost of that

[04:43:31 - 04:43:36]
ml M3

[04:43:33 - 04:43:38]
medium

[04:43:36 - 04:43:39]
pricing and so here they're suggesting

[04:43:38 - 04:43:42]
it's

[04:43:39 - 04:43:44]
067 uh per hour so almost like half a

[04:43:42 - 04:43:45]
dollar um so maybe you might want to be

[04:43:44 - 04:43:47]
really careful with that here it's

[04:43:45 - 04:43:49]
saying a dollar so again it really

[04:43:47 - 04:43:53]
depends maybe I was a bit off with my

[04:43:49 - 04:43:53]
cost here

[04:43:54 - 04:43:58]
um come on show me the instances

[04:43:58 - 04:44:01]
here

[04:44:02 - 04:44:09]
and Jupiter

[04:44:05 - 04:44:10]
lab oh no 05 cents okay so yeah it was

[04:44:09 - 04:44:12]
what I thought it's it's it's it's a

[04:44:10 - 04:44:14]
nickel it's a nickel per hour right but

[04:44:12 - 04:44:17]
that's going to add up over time so if

[04:44:14 - 04:44:20]
you had that over let's say 730 hours if

[04:44:17 - 04:44:23]
you ran it all day every

[04:44:20 - 04:44:26]
day all day every day sorry let's go

[04:44:23 - 04:44:31]
back here we say

[04:44:26 - 04:44:34]
0.05 times this $36 see I was pretty

[04:44:31 - 04:44:37]
close um when you set up Sage maker the

[04:44:34 - 04:44:40]
domains you can choose to have it shut

[04:44:37 - 04:44:41]
down uh like uh over time so you don't

[04:44:40 - 04:44:44]
have to worry about coming back and and

[04:44:41 - 04:44:46]
shutting it down that is in uh let's go

[04:44:44 - 04:44:48]
back over here for a second databus

[04:44:46 - 04:44:52]
amazon.com so I can show

[04:44:48 - 04:44:57]
that but if we go here on the left hand

[04:44:52 - 04:44:57]
side to uh sagemaker

[04:44:57 - 04:45:02]
AI almost all the providers renamed

[04:45:00 - 04:45:04]
their stuff it's ridiculous um so we'll

[04:45:02 - 04:45:05]
go over to Studio or maybe the domains

[04:45:04 - 04:45:06]
the domains here because if we click

[04:45:05 - 04:45:09]
into

[04:45:06 - 04:45:11]
here cuz I didn't show you the setup

[04:45:09 - 04:45:14]
here but there's some configuration app

[04:45:11 - 04:45:16]
configuration and in here you can tell

[04:45:14 - 04:45:19]
it uh to shut

[04:45:16 - 04:45:20]
down so if I go here customize

[04:45:19 - 04:45:23]
stagemaker

[04:45:20 - 04:45:28]
UI uh it's not

[04:45:23 - 04:45:31]
there go down here ah here it is so if

[04:45:28 - 04:45:32]
we edit this we can just say like enable

[04:45:31 - 04:45:34]
Idol shutdown so the idea is that if

[04:45:32 - 04:45:36]
it's running you forget about it then it

[04:45:34 - 04:45:37]
will shut down for you after a period of

[04:45:36 - 04:45:39]
time so this is something you absolutely

[04:45:37 - 04:45:40]
want to have turned on so I don't even

[04:45:39 - 04:45:42]
have it turned on so I'll just checkbox

[04:45:40 - 04:45:44]
it on

[04:45:42 - 04:45:47]
and it has an idle time of whatever that

[04:45:44 - 04:45:50]
is so this is

[04:45:47 - 04:45:51]
minutes uh default is so I would say

[04:45:50 - 04:45:55]
after 60 Minutes I would tell it to shut

[04:45:51 - 04:45:57]
down the lowest time yeah yeah so I

[04:45:55 - 04:45:59]
would do that and that would be a smart

[04:45:57 - 04:46:01]
to do okay because that way at least

[04:45:59 - 04:46:03]
you'll be in better shape that way but

[04:46:01 - 04:46:04]
anyway let's go back over to here and

[04:46:03 - 04:46:05]
we're ready to launch the space you can

[04:46:04 - 04:46:07]
see we can choose the storage other

[04:46:05 - 04:46:09]
things like that and this is where you

[04:46:07 - 04:46:11]
might want to choose like if you're

[04:46:09 - 04:46:12]
downloading a larger model You' want to

[04:46:11 - 04:46:16]
have more more space but I'm just

[04:46:12 - 04:46:17]
launching this up as an ml ml T3 medium

[04:46:16 - 04:46:19]
I I didn't drop this down but we have

[04:46:17 - 04:46:22]
other options we have a bunch of

[04:46:19 - 04:46:24]
different compute either with uh CPUs or

[04:46:22 - 04:46:25]
with gpus attached and so we're just

[04:46:24 - 04:46:27]
going to wait for this space to start up

[04:46:25 - 04:46:29]
this one's one of the fastest starting

[04:46:27 - 04:46:31]
um instances so we're just going to

[04:46:29 - 04:46:33]
stick with this for

[04:46:31 - 04:46:35]
now

[04:46:33 - 04:46:37]
okay now you could also launch an ec2

[04:46:35 - 04:46:38]
instance with Compu and install jupyter

[04:46:37 - 04:46:39]
notebooks and that might be something I

[04:46:38 - 04:46:41]
might show you how to do just so you

[04:46:39 - 04:46:43]
know how to install jupter not

[04:46:41 - 04:46:45]
or Jupiter Labs servers from scratch

[04:46:43 - 04:46:47]
which is something you absolutely should

[04:46:45 - 04:46:50]
know how to do as it becomes super handy

[04:46:47 - 04:46:53]
in many use cases but again just waiting

[04:46:50 - 04:46:54]
for this to spin up so give it a moment

[04:46:53 - 04:46:57]
there we go now I can open this up in

[04:46:54 - 04:47:00]
Jupiter lab

[04:46:57 - 04:47:02]
okay and so this will open up a Jupiter

[04:47:00 - 04:47:02]
lab

[04:47:03 - 04:47:09]
environment and I'll just create a new

[04:47:05 - 04:47:11]
notebook here and we'll do our standard

[04:47:09 - 04:47:17]
this actually is probably pre-installed

[04:47:11 - 04:47:18]
so the kernel for um for uh uh stage

[04:47:17 - 04:47:19]
maker comes with a lot of stuff

[04:47:18 - 04:47:21]
pre-installed and this is where you

[04:47:19 - 04:47:24]
could run into issues because if let's

[04:47:21 - 04:47:27]
say you need a very specific version of

[04:47:24 - 04:47:29]
um or like very specific compile flags

[04:47:27 - 04:47:32]
for something like um pie torch or

[04:47:29 - 04:47:34]
tensor flow you could run it issues but

[04:47:32 - 04:47:36]
it says it's already satisfied because

[04:47:34 - 04:47:37]
it's already installed in this

[04:47:36 - 04:47:38]
environment so we're not going to do

[04:47:37 - 04:47:40]
anything fancy I just wanted to show you

[04:47:38 - 04:47:43]
how to get to that I'll go ahead and hit

[04:47:40 - 04:47:44]
Lo log out here I don't think that stops

[04:47:43 - 04:47:47]
stops everything I usually don't do that

[04:47:44 - 04:47:49]
I usually go here and just hit the stop

[04:47:47 - 04:47:50]
button okay so it brought us over here

[04:47:49 - 04:47:52]
which is kind of funny I'm going to give

[04:47:50 - 04:47:53]
this a hard refresh I don't think it

[04:47:52 - 04:47:55]
stopped the space but let's take a look

[04:47:53 - 04:47:57]
and see what happens right so if you

[04:47:55 - 04:47:59]
want to stop it you got to stop it over

[04:47:57 - 04:48:01]
here right and you can have it hang

[04:47:59 - 04:48:04]
around there might be storage cost

[04:48:01 - 04:48:07]
longterm under 30 I think you're fine um

[04:48:04 - 04:48:10]
because under like it's 30 and above

[04:48:07 - 04:48:11]
you're out of free tier or above above

[04:48:10 - 04:48:13]
30

[04:48:11 - 04:48:17]
let I delete that and so that is how we

[04:48:13 - 04:48:18]
would do that with sage maker Studio to

[04:48:17 - 04:48:21]
have that and that's something you can

[04:48:18 - 04:48:25]
absolutely utilize um uh

[04:48:21 - 04:48:27]
[Music]

[04:48:25 - 04:48:29]
yeah okay so we looked at stagemaker

[04:48:27 - 04:48:32]
Studio but let's go take a look at Azure

[04:48:29 - 04:48:33]
ml studio um so I'm going to make my way

[04:48:32 - 04:48:36]
over to

[04:48:33 - 04:48:40]
Azure I think it's just uh portal do

[04:48:36 - 04:48:42]
portal. azure.com and

[04:48:40 - 04:48:45]
I'm not doing this every day I don't

[04:48:42 - 04:48:47]
really build pipelines um uh workloads

[04:48:45 - 04:48:48]
in here but I've obviously taught um a

[04:48:47 - 04:48:51]
lot of this so I'm pretty comfortable

[04:48:48 - 04:48:52]
with it um and there is a way to launch

[04:48:51 - 04:48:56]
things in Azure AI Studio I think it's

[04:48:52 - 04:48:59]
now called Foundry which is

[04:48:56 - 04:49:02]
azure AI Foundry did they rename

[04:48:59 - 04:49:03]
it it doesn't look renamed to me I

[04:49:02 - 04:49:05]
thought they renamed

[04:49:03 - 04:49:08]
it nope it's still called Azure AI

[04:49:05 - 04:49:10]
Studio okay maybe that's an external

[04:49:08 - 04:49:12]
service I'm kind of curious there Azure

[04:49:10 - 04:49:12]
AI

[04:49:13 - 04:49:19]
boundary where's the rename here we go

[04:49:16 - 04:49:21]
oh maybe it's said AI ai. azure.com if

[04:49:19 - 04:49:23]
we go here is that where it

[04:49:21 - 04:49:25]
is this might like uh Microsoft likes to

[04:49:23 - 04:49:27]
have more entry points into their

[04:49:25 - 04:49:29]
products I don't have a project called

[04:49:27 - 04:49:32]
that we'll select another project

[04:49:29 - 04:49:36]
here um but I think this is just another

[04:49:32 - 04:49:39]
way to a access Azure AI studio uh I

[04:49:36 - 04:49:41]
have a a Japanese example here from a

[04:49:39 - 04:49:42]
while ago that's a hub this this is not

[04:49:41 - 04:49:44]
the way that I would like to do it but

[04:49:42 - 04:49:46]
if we click into here this is just an

[04:49:44 - 04:49:47]
existing project I'm not suggesting you

[04:49:46 - 04:49:48]
to make a project in here I just want to

[04:49:47 - 04:49:50]
show

[04:49:48 - 04:49:51]
you um yeah we have to make a new

[04:49:50 - 04:49:54]
project but there's compute here on the

[04:49:51 - 04:49:56]
left hand side and so you could

[04:49:54 - 04:49:58]
technically launch up a compute inance

[04:49:56 - 04:49:59]
here I don't recommend doing it here

[04:49:58 - 04:50:03]
because the experience here is kind of

[04:49:59 - 04:50:05]
broken and so when you're using Azure I

[04:50:03 - 04:50:07]
would recommend going into specifically

[04:50:05 - 04:50:09]
Azure machine learning service and here

[04:50:07 - 04:50:10]
you can see I have an example I'm going

[04:50:09 - 04:50:12]
to go ahead and delete that I'm not

[04:50:10 - 04:50:15]
using it right now now um so I just want

[04:50:12 - 04:50:17]
to go ahead and delete this for

[04:50:15 - 04:50:20]
now um I'm looking for the resource

[04:50:17 - 04:50:22]
Group to

[04:50:20 - 04:50:24]
delete how do I keep up with all these

[04:50:22 - 04:50:25]
clouds I don't know okay you're probably

[04:50:24 - 04:50:27]
asking me that but I'm going to go ahead

[04:50:25 - 04:50:29]
and just delete this now for stagemaker

[04:50:27 - 04:50:30]
Studio I didn't show you how to set it

[04:50:29 - 04:50:33]
up completely but for this I will it's a

[04:50:30 - 04:50:34]
little bit um straightforward to to

[04:50:33 - 04:50:36]
create and delete so I'm going to go

[04:50:34 - 04:50:38]
ahead here and make a new workspace I

[04:50:36 - 04:50:39]
don't know what this costs um to me it's

[04:50:38 - 04:50:41]
like pennies if you're worried about it

[04:50:39 - 04:50:42]
don't do it if you know Azure pretty

[04:50:41 - 04:50:44]
well and you're comfortable with it go

[04:50:42 - 04:50:48]
ahead and do that um but we'll go ahead

[04:50:44 - 04:50:50]
and just say a example and I'm going to

[04:50:48 - 04:50:52]
just say a example the region does

[04:50:50 - 04:50:53]
matter because different computers

[04:50:52 - 04:50:55]
available in different areas I don't

[04:50:53 - 04:50:57]
know what to choose so I'm going to use

[04:50:55 - 04:50:58]
uh Central us I don't want anything

[04:50:57 - 04:51:01]
Fanci here today it's creating a bunch

[04:50:58 - 04:51:02]
of these other things here I don't think

[04:51:01 - 04:51:06]
I need container registry so I'm going

[04:51:02 - 04:51:07]
to ignore that we'll go next um I'm

[04:51:06 - 04:51:08]
going to leave it as public I'm going to

[04:51:07 - 04:51:11]
go ahead and just go ahead and create

[04:51:08 - 04:51:12]
this and so we'll have to wait a little

[04:51:11 - 04:51:14]
bit for this to create shouldn't take

[04:51:12 - 04:51:16]
too long

[04:51:14 - 04:51:17]
okay I don't sure if there's one other

[04:51:16 - 04:51:19]
step after here so I'm just going to

[04:51:17 - 04:51:21]
wait a little bit see if I have another

[04:51:19 - 04:51:24]
thing I have to confirm no there is not

[04:51:21 - 04:51:26]
I'll be back here in just a moment okay

[04:51:24 - 04:51:27]
all right so that's finished uh

[04:51:26 - 04:51:31]
deploying I'm going to go to my

[04:51:27 - 04:51:33]
resources here and I'm going to launch

[04:51:31 - 04:51:35]
studio and hopefully it looks the same

[04:51:33 - 04:51:38]
from the last time I was

[04:51:35 - 04:51:39]
here quite similar so on the left hand

[04:51:38 - 04:51:41]
side what I'm looking for is

[04:51:39 - 04:51:45]
environments

[04:51:41 - 04:51:47]
and I'm just going to ignore ignore

[04:51:45 - 04:51:49]
this um I could have swore it was from

[04:51:47 - 04:51:51]
here if it's not here there's another

[04:51:49 - 04:51:54]
place from in here to uh to launch it

[04:51:51 - 04:51:56]
but I was pretty

[04:51:54 - 04:51:58]
certain oh notebooks here on the left

[04:51:56 - 04:51:58]
hand

[04:52:00 - 04:52:05]
side um yeah create compute okay so I

[04:52:04 - 04:52:08]
mean I was looking for compute oh it's

[04:52:05 - 04:52:10]
down here computes down here okay so we

[04:52:08 - 04:52:12]
can create our compute over here or we

[04:52:10 - 04:52:13]
can just go through notebooks and and

[04:52:12 - 04:52:16]
create it here notice we have CPUs and

[04:52:13 - 04:52:17]
gpus just like ads you can you have

[04:52:16 - 04:52:19]
options that you can choose I like how

[04:52:17 - 04:52:23]
the prices are here on the right hand

[04:52:19 - 04:52:25]
side it's not 0.5 cents but um there are

[04:52:23 - 04:52:27]
other options here that we can utilize

[04:52:25 - 04:52:29]
so it really depends on what you wanted

[04:52:27 - 04:52:31]
they're just recommending ones here I

[04:52:29 - 04:52:33]
can just sort this by

[04:52:31 - 04:52:37]
cost and not as cheap as AWS but still

[04:52:33 - 04:52:40]
pretty good um and I'll go ahead to next

[04:52:37 - 04:52:41]
and we have idle shutdown so that's

[04:52:40 - 04:52:44]
really

[04:52:41 - 04:52:45]
good okay we have lots of good options

[04:52:44 - 04:52:46]
here I'll go ahead and review and create

[04:52:45 - 04:52:47]
so you can see the experience is a

[04:52:46 - 04:52:51]
little bit better than

[04:52:47 - 04:52:53]
ads not that anybody ever talks about it

[04:52:51 - 04:52:54]
um and so now we were waiting for that

[04:52:53 - 04:52:56]
compute we can go down here and probably

[04:52:54 - 04:52:58]
see it spinning up and so now we're just

[04:52:56 - 04:53:00]
waiting for that to create

[04:52:58 - 04:53:02]
okay all right so our compute is ready

[04:53:00 - 04:53:04]
let's go take a look and so we have a

[04:53:02 - 04:53:07]
few options we have Jupiter lab Jupiter

[04:53:04 - 04:53:08]
vs code um Jupiter is probably the old

[04:53:07 - 04:53:10]
Jupiter notebook so I don't sure why

[04:53:08 - 04:53:12]
you'd ever want to use that but we can

[04:53:10 - 04:53:13]
go ahead and open this one here and then

[04:53:12 - 04:53:16]
the vs code web I think we could run

[04:53:13 - 04:53:17]
these in parallel I'm not really sure um

[04:53:16 - 04:53:19]
but it's just going to give us an

[04:53:17 - 04:53:21]
environment that we can utilize so

[04:53:19 - 04:53:25]
nothing crazy here and there's no

[04:53:21 - 04:53:27]
surprise that um Azure can do this

[04:53:25 - 04:53:29]
because get Azure or Microsoft owns

[04:53:27 - 04:53:30]
GitHub so all this technology is

[04:53:29 - 04:53:32]
probably shared between them you'll

[04:53:30 - 04:53:33]
notice we have a few different options

[04:53:32 - 04:53:36]
depending on what you want to do we have

[04:53:33 - 04:53:37]
Azure ml the SDK version 3 I'm not doing

[04:53:36 - 04:53:39]
anything fancy so I'm just do something

[04:53:37 - 04:53:42]
simple here for the notebook I'm going

[04:53:39 - 04:53:45]
to do a pip install

[04:53:42 - 04:53:46]
Transformers again and again and again

[04:53:45 - 04:53:49]
till we get tired of it so we'll go

[04:53:46 - 04:53:51]
ahead and run this okay so we're now

[04:53:49 - 04:53:54]
installing Transformers which is great

[04:53:51 - 04:53:56]
I'm going to go over to here and we I'm

[04:53:54 - 04:53:57]
not sure if it mirrors the files I would

[04:53:56 - 04:53:59]
expect that it

[04:53:57 - 04:54:00]
would right I can save this file here

[04:53:59 - 04:54:01]
for a

[04:54:00 - 04:54:03]
second I'm just going to name it as

[04:54:01 - 04:54:09]
Untitled I don't

[04:54:03 - 04:54:11]
care and this one is being a little bit

[04:54:09 - 04:54:13]
unresponsive so is in preview so I'm not

[04:54:11 - 04:54:15]
really surprised it's not working but I

[04:54:13 - 04:54:17]
I don't really care okay we know that we

[04:54:15 - 04:54:19]
have this as an option and so this is

[04:54:17 - 04:54:20]
another way that you can run compute

[04:54:19 - 04:54:22]
obviously the reason that you use

[04:54:20 - 04:54:25]
sagemaker Azure ml is that they have

[04:54:22 - 04:54:27]
kernels that are specific to their

[04:54:25 - 04:54:30]
environments uh to make it easier to

[04:54:27 - 04:54:32]
work with Azure ml Studio or uh when

[04:54:30 - 04:54:34]
you're building pipelines or Sage maker

[04:54:32 - 04:54:37]
studio um but you can you generally use

[04:54:34 - 04:54:39]
them but sometimes I've ran into issues

[04:54:37 - 04:54:41]
using these things because the way they

[04:54:39 - 04:54:43]
have their their set up the stuff that's

[04:54:41 - 04:54:45]
pre-installed on them and that runs into

[04:54:43 - 04:54:47]
issues for me in order to delete this I

[04:54:45 - 04:54:49]
think we have to completely shut it down

[04:54:47 - 04:54:51]
first it is shutting down so now it will

[04:54:49 - 04:54:54]
delete it so now I don't have to worry

[04:54:51 - 04:54:57]
about that so that is how you get a

[04:54:54 - 04:54:58]
notebook running here on Azure ml studio

[04:54:57 - 04:55:02]
and it's up to you if you want to tear

[04:54:58 - 04:55:03]
down the uh the Azure Studio I showed

[04:55:02 - 04:55:06]
you that earlier in the video you just

[04:55:03 - 04:55:08]
go into um I mean I suppose I can delete

[04:55:06 - 04:55:10]
it now it's not that big of a deal but

[04:55:08 - 04:55:12]
you find your resource Group and you

[04:55:10 - 04:55:15]
delete your resource Group that is how

[04:55:12 - 04:55:18]
you're going to get rid of this here

[04:55:15 - 04:55:21]
okay

[04:55:18 - 04:55:24]
[Music]

[04:55:21 - 04:55:25]
ciao so let's go take a look at uh

[04:55:24 - 04:55:27]
another one called lightning ey I really

[04:55:25 - 04:55:31]
like lightning Ai and they do have a

[04:55:27 - 04:55:32]
free tier um so lightning AI is uh

[04:55:31 - 04:55:35]
basically a cloud developer environment

[04:55:32 - 04:55:37]
specialized specifically for working

[04:55:35 - 04:55:39]
with models okay and so I already have

[04:55:37 - 04:55:40]
an account here I don't feel like trying

[04:55:39 - 04:55:43]
to figure out how to log in but I'm

[04:55:40 - 04:55:45]
already logged in um and what's nice is

[04:55:43 - 04:55:47]
that Co here actually has a bunch of

[04:55:45 - 04:55:48]
different kinds of uh templates that you

[04:55:47 - 04:55:51]
can utilize so they have I think Studio

[04:55:48 - 04:55:53]
templates up here light I is totally uh

[04:55:51 - 04:55:55]
totally free to sign up for um and they

[04:55:53 - 04:55:59]
have paid tiers but here let's say we

[04:55:55 - 04:56:01]
wanted to use something like llama

[04:55:59 - 04:56:06]
3.2 say

[04:56:01 - 04:56:06]
llama 3.2 as an

[04:56:06 - 04:56:10]
example here's one serving it so I'm

[04:56:09 - 04:56:13]
going to click into this one I like this

[04:56:10 - 04:56:14]
one here and um they have like a video

[04:56:13 - 04:56:16]
on how to do it but if I just want to

[04:56:14 - 04:56:19]
start using it I just click open in

[04:56:16 - 04:56:22]
studio right again very easy to make an

[04:56:19 - 04:56:25]
account so this is going to open up here

[04:56:22 - 04:56:27]
in um lightning AI I actually have a

[04:56:25 - 04:56:29]
little stuffy of letting AI that's

[04:56:27 - 04:56:31]
that's how cool they

[04:56:29 - 04:56:33]
are and so what's interesting about this

[04:56:31 - 04:56:35]
one is that it's not just notebooks like

[04:56:33 - 04:56:39]
it has the vs code experience it has

[04:56:35 - 04:56:40]
notebooks um uh you can just open up the

[04:56:39 - 04:56:43]
terminal directly

[04:56:40 - 04:56:44]
um and the environment is controlled

[04:56:43 - 04:56:46]
over here so if I click into here this

[04:56:44 - 04:56:48]
is between CPUs and gpus so you can

[04:56:46 - 04:56:49]
usually switch between CPUs and GPU so

[04:56:48 - 04:56:52]
it will shut down but it'll bring the

[04:56:49 - 04:56:53]
environment over um so it's a lot more

[04:56:52 - 04:56:54]
flexible you can get a lot of

[04:56:53 - 04:56:58]
information about your

[04:56:54 - 04:57:00]
environment um it is it is super super

[04:56:58 - 04:57:02]
powerful like I would generally just

[04:57:00 - 04:57:03]
work in this because it's just so good

[04:57:02 - 04:57:06]
but the startup time is a little bit

[04:57:03 - 04:57:08]
slow but it's not that bad right um

[04:57:06 - 04:57:11]
lightning AI uh they've created a bunch

[04:57:08 - 04:57:12]
of Open Source projects light lit GP GPT

[04:57:11 - 04:57:13]
and things like that I'm sure we're

[04:57:12 - 04:57:15]
going to come back and revisit them CU

[04:57:13 - 04:57:18]
they're so awesome uh but right now it's

[04:57:15 - 04:57:20]
spinning up the gpus and um I can't

[04:57:18 - 04:57:22]
remember like how much you get for free

[04:57:20 - 04:57:25]
but even within the gpus there are

[04:57:22 - 04:57:28]
options that you can choose so so sign

[04:57:25 - 04:57:29]
into a cloud account but before you used

[04:57:28 - 04:57:31]
to say like which ones did you want to

[04:57:29 - 04:57:33]
shoot so right now this is running an

[04:57:31 - 04:57:36]
one Nvidia L4 tensor core graphics card

[04:57:33 - 04:57:38]
that's not a that's not a cheap one um

[04:57:36 - 04:57:39]
but I I could have swore that we had few

[04:57:38 - 04:57:42]
uh a few other options there if you

[04:57:39 - 04:57:44]
hover over this one it will also tell

[04:57:42 - 04:57:45]
us uh well we're not on it right now but

[04:57:44 - 04:57:47]
I could I could have swore that we'd

[04:57:45 - 04:57:49]
have that option but I think when we

[04:57:47 - 04:57:51]
spin up one uh initially we actually get

[04:57:49 - 04:57:53]
to choose what kind of compute we want

[04:57:51 - 04:57:56]
but this GPU is ready to go I'm going to

[04:57:53 - 04:57:58]
click into this example and this is the

[04:57:56 - 04:57:59]
kind of experience you'd get in vs code

[04:57:58 - 04:58:02]
so it's not exactly jupyter notebooks

[04:57:59 - 04:58:04]
but it has that jupyter note notebook x

[04:58:02 - 04:58:06]
uh experience if we wanted Jupiter uh

[04:58:04 - 04:58:08]
notebooks we just click Jupiter and we

[04:58:06 - 04:58:10]
have it so whichever one you want the vs

[04:58:08 - 04:58:12]
code experience with notebooks or the

[04:58:10 - 04:58:13]
Jupiter lab experience you can just

[04:58:12 - 04:58:16]
quickly switch between them well I say

[04:58:13 - 04:58:17]
quickly but quick enough and so I can go

[04:58:16 - 04:58:21]
here on the left hand side and and click

[04:58:17 - 04:58:22]
into here and uh yeah we can just run

[04:58:21 - 04:58:24]
through this so here it says start the

[04:58:22 - 04:58:26]
inference server on the terminal by

[04:58:24 - 04:58:27]
running the following command so here I

[04:58:26 - 04:58:32]
can just open up

[04:58:27 - 04:58:35]
terminal if I can find it file new

[04:58:32 - 04:58:38]
terminal and I'll just grab this

[04:58:35 - 04:58:40]
here again I'm not a super expert of

[04:58:38 - 04:58:42]
this stuff I'm just you know copying

[04:58:40 - 04:58:43]
pasting and and working through it so

[04:58:42 - 04:58:48]
here it's starting on on on binding on

[04:58:43 - 04:58:50]
Port 0000 8000 so here it is um it's

[04:58:48 - 04:58:52]
going to serve llama 3.21 billion so

[04:58:50 - 04:58:54]
it's downloading that model I'm going to

[04:58:52 - 04:58:56]
assume this is downloading from hugging

[04:58:54 - 04:58:59]
phase and L jbt is going to serve that

[04:58:56 - 04:59:02]
model in streaming mode with a Max token

[04:58:59 - 04:59:04]
of 200 okay and so that model is now

[04:59:02 - 04:59:06]
being served it's downloaded and serve

[04:59:04 - 04:59:09]
it's I think it was llama 1. 1B so

[04:59:06 - 04:59:10]
that's very small 3.2 1B and so here we

[04:59:09 - 04:59:12]
have our text we're go ahead and run

[04:59:10 - 04:59:15]
that and then we'll go down below here

[04:59:12 - 04:59:17]
and we'll run it like that okay and so

[04:59:15 - 04:59:20]
it's doing our sum summarization now we

[04:59:17 - 04:59:24]
can go over to vs code

[04:59:20 - 04:59:27]
here right if you prefer this

[04:59:24 - 04:59:28]
experience and I think that we don't

[04:59:27 - 04:59:29]
have to run this twice because it might

[04:59:28 - 04:59:30]
already be running so I'm going to go

[04:59:29 - 04:59:33]
ahead and just give this a go and see if

[04:59:30 - 04:59:35]
it works it might not work we'll see

[04:59:33 - 04:59:37]
what happens and so that terminal is

[04:59:35 - 04:59:39]
still running I think if we go over to

[04:59:37 - 04:59:42]
here we can see probably our open

[04:59:39 - 04:59:44]
connection CS yeah so see how we have

[04:59:42 - 04:59:46]
this this is it over here if we click

[04:59:44 - 04:59:48]
here I think it's bringing us back to

[04:59:46 - 04:59:50]
that terminal right that we were running

[04:59:48 - 04:59:52]
earlier so it's kind of cool how you can

[04:59:50 - 04:59:54]
go between them but this thing is super

[04:59:52 - 04:59:55]
super powerful um I'm done with this

[04:59:54 - 04:59:56]
environment so I'm going to try to

[04:59:55 - 04:59:57]
figure out how do I get to this I'm

[04:59:56 - 04:59:59]
going to go back over to maybe Andrew

[04:59:57 - 05:00:01]
Brown here and here we can see that it's

[04:59:59 - 05:00:03]
serving I just want to stop it so I'm

[05:00:01 - 05:00:06]
going to go ahead and delete this we'll

[05:00:03 - 05:00:08]
say delete as I don't want to use up my

[05:00:06 - 05:00:11]
gpus

[05:00:08 - 05:00:13]
here I can only imagine at some point

[05:00:11 - 05:00:14]
they might have some convoluted way uh

[05:00:13 - 05:00:16]
in order for you to be able to access

[05:00:14 - 05:00:19]
the gpus as crypto mining is a serious

[05:00:16 - 05:00:20]
issue for these folks for all of them

[05:00:19 - 05:00:21]
but if we go here let's say I just want

[05:00:20 - 05:00:23]
to do code I'm going to go ahead and do

[05:00:21 - 05:00:25]
that we actually have some options of

[05:00:23 - 05:00:26]
CPUs uh and we have the language model

[05:00:25 - 05:00:28]
template I'm going to go ahead and click

[05:00:26 - 05:00:30]
this because I just remember being able

[05:00:28 - 05:00:32]
to choose between different gpus maybe

[05:00:30 - 05:00:33]
that's only in the PID tier but yeah see

[05:00:32 - 05:00:37]
now it looks a little bit different see

[05:00:33 - 05:00:39]
it says 32 C CPUs let's see if we switch

[05:00:37 - 05:00:42]
oh here we go so I choose gpus and now I

[05:00:39 - 05:00:45]
have some options so we have a T4 an a1g

[05:00:42 - 05:00:48]
an L4 these are all Nvidia cards a100

[05:00:45 - 05:00:50]
h100 how many do you need so I really

[05:00:48 - 05:00:53]
like this kind of experience because it

[05:00:50 - 05:00:56]
it really makes you understand what kind

[05:00:53 - 05:00:58]
of uh gpus you're using underneath right

[05:00:56 - 05:00:59]
for CPUs I don't really know if there's

[05:00:58 - 05:01:03]
that many options here we have some so

[05:00:59 - 05:01:05]
we have 32 64 96 it's not

[05:01:03 - 05:01:07]
specifying what CPUs it's using here I'm

[05:01:05 - 05:01:10]
kind of curious what it would be

[05:01:07 - 05:01:12]
using I would like to know

[05:01:10 - 05:01:14]
maybe learn more but anyway here you can

[05:01:12 - 05:01:16]
see it's spitting up that environment so

[05:01:14 - 05:01:19]
definitely definitely we're going to

[05:01:16 - 05:01:21]
spend more time with lit GPT but we'll

[05:01:19 - 05:01:24]
spend time in other ones as

[05:01:21 - 05:01:26]
well um another one that can um that we

[05:01:24 - 05:01:28]
can utilize is

[05:01:26 - 05:01:30]
giod okay but we'll talk about that next

[05:01:28 - 05:01:32]
so we'll just stop this here so we're

[05:01:30 - 05:01:35]
not utilizing that I just delete

[05:01:32 - 05:01:38]
it and uh we'll look at another one here

[05:01:35 - 05:01:41]
[Music]

[05:01:38 - 05:01:43]
okay let's go take a look at uh git pod

[05:01:41 - 05:01:46]
now G pod has just recently changed

[05:01:43 - 05:01:48]
their Model A little bit um and so what

[05:01:46 - 05:01:51]
I would normally do is just launch a a

[05:01:48 - 05:01:53]
workspace but I want to launch it with

[05:01:51 - 05:01:55]
gpus okay so down below here we have

[05:01:53 - 05:01:56]
standard but there's a way to do with

[05:01:55 - 05:02:00]
gpus which is new so I'm going to go

[05:01:56 - 05:02:04]
ahead and say get get pod um

[05:02:00 - 05:02:06]
gpus I was just at uh reinvent and uh

[05:02:04 - 05:02:11]
Lou was showing this to me so I

[05:02:06 - 05:02:13]
absolutely know they have GPU support

[05:02:11 - 05:02:16]
um and it's configured in their Dev

[05:02:13 - 05:02:19]
container maybe we go over to G pod

[05:02:16 - 05:02:21]
here okay just the main site here it's

[05:02:19 - 05:02:25]
going to keep logging me in here and

[05:02:21 - 05:02:27]
somewhere in here there's a way to

[05:02:25 - 05:02:29]
download the new

[05:02:27 - 05:02:33]
environment so I

[05:02:29 - 05:02:36]
want gpus I know we can do gpus here

[05:02:33 - 05:02:40]
we'll go over to maybe the the

[05:02:36 - 05:02:41]
resources um

[05:02:40 - 05:02:45]
view

[05:02:41 - 05:02:47]
all and so now we're into our docs here

[05:02:45 - 05:02:50]
and so somewhere

[05:02:47 - 05:02:55]
here we can configure gpus I know we can

[05:02:50 - 05:02:56]
do it I I've seen it in person um but

[05:02:55 - 05:02:59]
like I didn't know they had gpus and

[05:02:56 - 05:03:01]
then Lou showed me and I was like why

[05:02:59 - 05:03:03]
aren't we using Gip pod but uh I think

[05:03:01 - 05:03:04]
it's that it's like it maybe just not

[05:03:03 - 05:03:07]
well

[05:03:04 - 05:03:10]
known maybe it's cuz it's so new and so

[05:03:07 - 05:03:12]
I saw him configured in a Dev container

[05:03:10 - 05:03:14]
Json

[05:03:12 - 05:03:16]
file

[05:03:14 - 05:03:18]
um so just give me a second I'm going to

[05:03:16 - 05:03:20]
go find it okay I remember there's a

[05:03:18 - 05:03:20]
thing called git pod desktop so maybe

[05:03:20 - 05:03:23]
that's something that I might want to

[05:03:20 - 05:03:24]
downlo git pod desktop no that would run

[05:03:23 - 05:03:27]
it

[05:03:24 - 05:03:29]
locally yeah that's not what I want yeah

[05:03:27 - 05:03:32]
let me just look at the docs a bit more

[05:03:29 - 05:03:33]
okay I just absolutely cannot find it

[05:03:32 - 05:03:35]
there's no way I can find it but that

[05:03:33 - 05:03:37]
doesn't mean that we still can't use G

[05:03:35 - 05:03:39]
pod G pod um it has a notebook

[05:03:37 - 05:03:41]
experience CU it has vs code so maybe

[05:03:39 - 05:03:44]
we'll just take a look at

[05:03:41 - 05:03:46]
anything um anything that we want so I'm

[05:03:44 - 05:03:48]
just trying to think of like I don't

[05:03:46 - 05:03:49]
need anything in particular I just need

[05:03:48 - 05:03:50]
like an example rep I'm just going to

[05:03:49 - 05:03:52]
type an example it really doesn't matter

[05:03:50 - 05:03:55]
what we do I even go to the ad examples

[05:03:52 - 05:03:57]
one here and so I have git pod install

[05:03:55 - 05:04:00]
with the git pod Chrome extension uh you

[05:03:57 - 05:04:02]
could also just put in the front here um

[05:04:00 - 05:04:05]
let me do like G pod. and it will still

[05:04:02 - 05:04:06]
work so I'll do this uh just in case you

[05:04:05 - 05:04:10]
don't have the extension

[05:04:06 - 05:04:12]
installed is it this can I do that

[05:04:10 - 05:04:15]
um maybe I take this part out like that

[05:04:12 - 05:04:18]
I forgot how to do it it's been a while

[05:04:15 - 05:04:18]
um for slash like

[05:04:18 - 05:04:22]
this github.com

[05:04:24 - 05:04:30]
nope this is just to be a GitHub iio in

[05:04:26 - 05:04:30]
front of here but if I go to this URL

[05:04:30 - 05:04:36]
here well anyway I'll just click

[05:04:33 - 05:04:38]
it it looks like the URL is a little bit

[05:04:36 - 05:04:40]
different now um but anyway if you don't

[05:04:38 - 05:04:42]
have that Chrome extension like Chrome

[05:04:40 - 05:04:44]
git pod

[05:04:42 - 05:04:45]
extension but even at the time of this

[05:04:44 - 05:04:47]
video I don't know if they're going away

[05:04:45 - 05:04:49]
from this kind of system and they're

[05:04:47 - 05:04:51]
letting you run it locally now but I

[05:04:49 - 05:04:52]
anyway I just have this open and I just

[05:04:51 - 05:04:55]
wanted to show you in giot it's super

[05:04:52 - 05:04:57]
fast how fast it launches but I can go

[05:04:55 - 05:05:00]
ahead and make a new file and I

[05:04:57 - 05:05:02]
specifically want to make a

[05:05:00 - 05:05:04]
um I'm not going to save this I'm just

[05:05:02 - 05:05:05]
going to make a new file here allow yeah

[05:05:04 - 05:05:08]
yeah

[05:05:05 - 05:05:11]
allow and it's uh it's going to be like

[05:05:08 - 05:05:11]
I'll say example

[05:05:11 - 05:05:18]
ironpython uh nyb I think that's what it

[05:05:15 - 05:05:21]
is and we should be able to maybe I

[05:05:18 - 05:05:23]
named the extension wrong it's I in

[05:05:21 - 05:05:27]
Python

[05:05:23 - 05:05:29]
ynb there we go Y and B and so now we

[05:05:27 - 05:05:32]
can add stuff here so I can say what is

[05:05:29 - 05:05:35]
our python version so

[05:05:32 - 05:05:37]
python H hyen version and so this is

[05:05:35 - 05:05:39]
going to be really good if let's just

[05:05:37 - 05:05:41]
say you are I want some installations

[05:05:39 - 05:05:44]
here maybe it doesn't have python

[05:05:41 - 05:05:44]
extension the Jupiter

[05:05:44 - 05:05:47]
extension so we're installing the

[05:05:46 - 05:05:49]
jupyter extension so it can do jupyter

[05:05:47 - 05:05:50]
like things and so we'll just choose our

[05:05:49 - 05:05:54]
python environment here we'll just use

[05:05:50 - 05:05:55]
the default one let's all run it and it

[05:05:54 - 05:05:57]
says it's a magic cell but the body cell

[05:05:55 - 05:05:59]
is

[05:05:57 - 05:06:01]
empty uh because I just want to run

[05:05:59 - 05:06:03]
python what's uh what's wrong with that

[05:06:01 - 05:06:05]
uh maybe I do pip install I'll just try

[05:06:03 - 05:06:09]
to install some here pip install uh

[05:06:05 - 05:06:11]
Transformers can I do that

[05:06:09 - 05:06:14]
there we go so this is another

[05:06:11 - 05:06:16]
environment that we can utilize and if

[05:06:14 - 05:06:20]
you are not utilizing gpus like you're

[05:06:16 - 05:06:22]
just using serverless um serverless uh

[05:06:20 - 05:06:24]
apis then this is going to be fine for

[05:06:22 - 05:06:26]
you obviously we could also use uh

[05:06:24 - 05:06:28]
GitHub now again there is a way to

[05:06:26 - 05:06:30]
configure gpus we're just going to have

[05:06:28 - 05:06:31]
to wait till we talk to Lou he's in the

[05:06:30 - 05:06:33]
boot camp so he's going to definitely

[05:06:31 - 05:06:36]
show us how to do it but what I've been

[05:06:33 - 05:06:37]
told is that g pod now can run anywhere

[05:06:36 - 05:06:39]
so like you could choose any type of

[05:06:37 - 05:06:41]
compute that you want at ads or other

[05:06:39 - 05:06:42]
platform forms um but it's probably in

[05:06:41 - 05:06:43]
the pay tier and there's probably other

[05:06:42 - 05:06:45]
caveat and I I don't have that

[05:06:43 - 05:06:46]
information but just as a cloud

[05:06:45 - 05:06:48]
developer environment experience I

[05:06:46 - 05:06:51]
really like this when I don't care about

[05:06:48 - 05:06:52]
gpus um and if we do have gpus we'll

[05:06:51 - 05:06:53]
have to learn a little bit more about

[05:06:52 - 05:06:56]
that later on I'm going to go ahead and

[05:06:53 - 05:06:58]
stop that workspace and so that is g pod

[05:06:56 - 05:07:00]
as an example for somewhere where we can

[05:06:58 - 05:07:03]
work with

[05:07:00 - 05:07:05]
[Music]

[05:07:03 - 05:07:07]
notebooks all right so if we took a look

[05:07:05 - 05:07:09]
at G pod well we should probably take a

[05:07:07 - 05:07:11]
look at GitHub code spaces so I'm back

[05:07:09 - 05:07:13]
backing my ad examples repository again

[05:07:11 - 05:07:15]
it doesn't matter where we are but

[05:07:13 - 05:07:16]
there's a Code tab here and we go to

[05:07:15 - 05:07:18]
code spaces and I'm going to go ahead

[05:07:16 - 05:07:21]
and launch one and we get free compute

[05:07:18 - 05:07:24]
here um does codes spaces have gpus I

[05:07:21 - 05:07:25]
don't know um I would imagine that that

[05:07:24 - 05:07:26]
would be something on their road map

[05:07:25 - 05:07:27]
code spaces

[05:07:26 - 05:07:30]
[Music]

[05:07:27 - 05:07:31]
gpus lightning AI comes up right away we

[05:07:30 - 05:07:32]
might take a look at runp pod I've never

[05:07:31 - 05:07:34]
used it it's been on my road map to take

[05:07:32 - 05:07:40]
a look

[05:07:34 - 05:07:40]
at um but do they have gpus I don't know

[05:07:41 - 05:07:46]
and yeah I don't care about

[05:07:43 - 05:07:48]
this uh and so this is launching up here

[05:07:46 - 05:07:50]
I hate how it always defaults to uh it

[05:07:48 - 05:07:51]
never remembers my theme so I have to go

[05:07:50 - 05:07:54]
here and change the

[05:07:51 - 05:07:58]
theme and even that takes time to load

[05:07:54 - 05:07:59]
up um but when we're here we actually

[05:07:58 - 05:08:01]
can click the plus and we could have a

[05:07:59 - 05:08:02]
little bit more options about the type

[05:08:01 - 05:08:04]
of computer we can launch up and I

[05:08:02 - 05:08:06]
didn't want to make two I wanted to

[05:08:04 - 05:08:09]
literally have options there we go

[05:08:06 - 05:08:11]
configure Dev container right and so if

[05:08:09 - 05:08:12]
we go here I hope it's not just Jason it

[05:08:11 - 05:08:16]
is just

[05:08:12 - 05:08:19]
Jason okay we'll go back for a moment I

[05:08:16 - 05:08:21]
want a UI here uh notice I have two here

[05:08:19 - 05:08:23]
by accident I'm going to go ahead and

[05:08:21 - 05:08:26]
delete this one delete it I don't need

[05:08:23 - 05:08:29]
two right but what I was looking for was

[05:08:26 - 05:08:33]
options for me to change

[05:08:29 - 05:08:36]
um uh the compute right so here we are

[05:08:33 - 05:08:38]
and we go down here we have two core to

[05:08:36 - 05:08:40]
16 core um you can see we get quite a

[05:08:38 - 05:08:42]
bit of memory so I didn't really see

[05:08:40 - 05:08:43]
those options over at giod you just

[05:08:42 - 05:08:45]
don't really think about your compute

[05:08:43 - 05:08:46]
levels but there is now a way to change

[05:08:45 - 05:08:49]
the compute underneath but if you're

[05:08:46 - 05:08:52]
working with LMS locally even if it's on

[05:08:49 - 05:08:54]
CPUs and you they're optimized you're

[05:08:52 - 05:08:56]
going to need like a lot of ram but

[05:08:54 - 05:08:58]
these seem to have considerable Ram even

[05:08:56 - 05:09:00]
the two core one has a lot of ram so

[05:08:58 - 05:09:02]
that's totally fine but maybe 32 64 is

[05:09:00 - 05:09:04]
where you want to float you want

[05:09:02 - 05:09:06]
obviously more cor so that might be a

[05:09:04 - 05:09:08]
little bit different again if you're

[05:09:06 - 05:09:09]
working with service apis it doesn't

[05:09:08 - 05:09:11]
matter what you use you can just use

[05:09:09 - 05:09:14]
utilize this but one thing we want to

[05:09:11 - 05:09:15]
see is that notebook experience um so

[05:09:14 - 05:09:17]
I'm going to go ahead down in the bottom

[05:09:15 - 05:09:19]
left corner I'm going to go to our

[05:09:17 - 05:09:21]
settings I'm just going to no that's not

[05:09:19 - 05:09:24]
what I wanted I wanted to go to theme

[05:09:21 - 05:09:26]
sorry and I just want to change this to

[05:09:24 - 05:09:28]
a darker one it's a little bit hard in

[05:09:26 - 05:09:29]
the eyes this one here light themes are

[05:09:28 - 05:09:31]
fine but that light theme in particular

[05:09:29 - 05:09:34]
was uh horrendous I'm going to go ahead

[05:09:31 - 05:09:37]
and just make a new file here I we say

[05:09:34 - 05:09:42]
I'll just allow it new file and it'll be

[05:09:37 - 05:09:43]
example IP for iron python um ynb I

[05:09:42 - 05:09:46]
don't know why it's

[05:09:43 - 05:09:47]
ynb U for Jupiter and so we have a

[05:09:46 - 05:09:49]
similar experience here so I'm going to

[05:09:47 - 05:09:51]
go ahead and just do uh you know pip

[05:09:49 - 05:09:54]
install

[05:09:51 - 05:09:57]
Transformers okay we'll hit enter and it

[05:09:54 - 05:09:59]
will want install python uh and the

[05:09:57 - 05:10:00]
Jupiter extension so that it can work

[05:09:59 - 05:10:03]
with

[05:10:00 - 05:10:06]
it so you get a Jupiter

[05:10:03 - 05:10:08]
xes experience the only thing I don't

[05:10:06 - 05:10:10]
like about uh juper no actually I don't

[05:10:08 - 05:10:11]
mind uh not books but notebooks usually

[05:10:10 - 05:10:14]
will tell you the time whereas duper

[05:10:11 - 05:10:15]
notebooks won't and so you have to do an

[05:10:14 - 05:10:17]
extra command to do that we'll see that

[05:10:15 - 05:10:19]
later on I'm choosing the default python

[05:10:17 - 05:10:23]
environment the kernel that comes with

[05:10:19 - 05:10:25]
it and so here we can do pip install

[05:10:23 - 05:10:28]
Transformers and that should work fine

[05:10:25 - 05:10:32]
here but yeah could you attach gpus with

[05:10:28 - 05:10:35]
GitHub Cod spaces I don't know but G pod

[05:10:32 - 05:10:36]
you can but I don't know how to do that

[05:10:35 - 05:10:38]
okay so that's working fine so I'm going

[05:10:36 - 05:10:39]
to go ahead and I'm done with this

[05:10:38 - 05:10:42]
worksspace so I'm going to go ah and

[05:10:39 - 05:10:44]
click that and I want to make sure that

[05:10:42 - 05:10:46]
it's stopped I don't want it to keep

[05:10:44 - 05:10:51]
running um so we'll go back over to

[05:10:46 - 05:10:53]
github.com and I'll go into my AIS

[05:10:51 - 05:10:56]
examples and let's go ahead and just

[05:10:53 - 05:10:57]
delete this okay actually you know what

[05:10:56 - 05:11:00]
I noticed here is that we have some

[05:10:57 - 05:11:01]
other options so we can open Jupiter lab

[05:11:00 - 05:11:03]
this is definitely new I'll click that

[05:11:01 - 05:11:04]
and see what that experience is like

[05:11:03 - 05:11:07]
says it's preview so I'm not sure how

[05:11:04 - 05:11:09]
long that's sticking around here but I

[05:11:07 - 05:11:11]
can't imagine it's that much different

[05:11:09 - 05:11:15]
um experience right so we'll click that

[05:11:11 - 05:11:18]
see how that looks

[05:11:15 - 05:11:20]
um unable to start code space maybe

[05:11:18 - 05:11:22]
because I deleted it we'll go ahead and

[05:11:20 - 05:11:25]
try this one Jupiter notebook I didn't

[05:11:22 - 05:11:25]
even know this was an

[05:11:25 - 05:11:29]
option

[05:11:27 - 05:11:34]
um Jupiter lab is the latest web based

[05:11:29 - 05:11:34]
interface okay but that's not Jupiter

[05:11:35 - 05:11:41]
lab is it running jupyter lab and then I

[05:11:37 - 05:11:41]
connect to it

[05:11:42 - 05:11:46]
okay so these are

[05:11:43 - 05:11:48]
templates for um you you working with

[05:11:46 - 05:11:49]
notebooks but this isn't actually The

[05:11:48 - 05:11:52]
Notebook experience which I was hoping

[05:11:49 - 05:11:55]
for I'm going to go back over to um the

[05:11:52 - 05:11:55]
repo wherever that

[05:11:57 - 05:12:03]
was it's not what I

[05:11:59 - 05:12:06]
wanted and now I'm also

[05:12:03 - 05:12:08]
running this template here can I go here

[05:12:06 - 05:12:11]
and let's click this open in Jupiter lab

[05:12:08 - 05:12:11]
there we go

[05:12:12 - 05:12:16]
and so maybe this what this will do this

[05:12:14 - 05:12:18]
looks a lot like G pod right now that

[05:12:16 - 05:12:21]
looks like a lot like G pod right now

[05:12:18 - 05:12:23]
but that's not g pod um and so maybe

[05:12:21 - 05:12:25]
this will open up in the Jupiter server

[05:12:23 - 05:12:28]
experiences which which is what I'm

[05:12:25 - 05:12:30]
looking for here we'll give it a moment

[05:12:28 - 05:12:32]
here it is then we have all my stuff

[05:12:30 - 05:12:34]
here we can go ahead and create a new

[05:12:32 - 05:12:35]
notebook right so now we have our

[05:12:34 - 05:12:37]
Jupiter notebook experience so I'll do

[05:12:35 - 05:12:40]
pip install

[05:12:37 - 05:12:42]
Transformers okay okay we'll run

[05:12:40 - 05:12:45]
that there we go so that's nice if we

[05:12:42 - 05:12:46]
don't want to use vs we can use that

[05:12:45 - 05:12:50]
there we'll go ahead and delete that so

[05:12:46 - 05:12:52]
that is now in good shape um okay so

[05:12:50 - 05:12:56]
that is GitHub code

[05:12:52 - 05:12:58]
[Music]

[05:12:56 - 05:13:00]
spaces all right let's take a look at

[05:12:58 - 05:13:02]
deep note which is another place where

[05:13:00 - 05:13:04]
you can have um a notebook so I've

[05:13:02 - 05:13:05]
actually never used this service before

[05:13:04 - 05:13:07]
so it should be very exciting to give

[05:13:05 - 05:13:10]
this a go but uh the reason I'm looking

[05:13:07 - 05:13:12]
at it is that it does have a free tier

[05:13:10 - 05:13:14]
um and so we'll take a look at what it

[05:13:12 - 05:13:16]
can do apparently on the free tier we

[05:13:14 - 05:13:19]
have CPUs I'm not sure if this Handles

[05:13:16 - 05:13:20]
gpus in here but it clearly has a lot

[05:13:19 - 05:13:22]
going on in here yeah there are gpus

[05:13:20 - 05:13:24]
down below so I guess if you wanted to

[05:13:22 - 05:13:27]
attach gpus you could absolutely do so

[05:13:24 - 05:13:28]
let's take a look at deep note and see

[05:13:27 - 05:13:29]
how this goes so I'm going to go ahead

[05:13:28 - 05:13:32]
I'm just going to connect with my Google

[05:13:29 - 05:13:34]
account though probably we'll have to

[05:13:32 - 05:13:36]
connect GitHub if we want to do anything

[05:13:34 - 05:13:40]
productive uh productive but we'll see

[05:13:36 - 05:13:40]
so go ahead and hit continue

[05:13:42 - 05:13:46]
and learn or teach data science yeah I

[05:13:45 - 05:13:50]
mean technically I'm educating so let's

[05:13:46 - 05:13:52]
go ahead and do that oh I'm not that

[05:13:50 - 05:13:54]
kind but we'll go ahead here which best

[05:13:52 - 05:13:56]
describes you I'm a teacher uh but I

[05:13:54 - 05:13:58]
think what they are asking me is like

[05:13:56 - 05:13:59]
you know what I am in that sense we'll

[05:13:58 - 05:14:00]
go ahead and hit continue and get

[05:13:59 - 05:14:02]
through this

[05:14:00 - 05:14:05]
here I don't need to invite a bunch of

[05:14:02 - 05:14:07]
people and so now we have our area here

[05:14:05 - 05:14:10]
and so oh yeah cool we got data I mean

[05:14:07 - 05:14:13]
data is a big thing when it comes to um

[05:14:10 - 05:14:15]
working with uh geni models or or ml in

[05:14:13 - 05:14:18]
general I'm just not very good at data

[05:14:15 - 05:14:19]
despite making data courses um but yeah

[05:14:18 - 05:14:21]
looks like we have some rich

[05:14:19 - 05:14:22]
visualizations things like that but what

[05:14:21 - 05:14:23]
I want to see is just our standard

[05:14:22 - 05:14:27]
notebooks let's go ahead and create a

[05:14:23 - 05:14:28]
new notebook and oh maybe these aren't

[05:14:27 - 05:14:30]
the normal kind of notebooks I thought

[05:14:28 - 05:14:34]
this is going to be like Jupiter

[05:14:30 - 05:14:36]
notebooks oh okay this is really really

[05:14:34 - 05:14:38]
different this is really really really

[05:14:36 - 05:14:40]
different okay let's go back over to our

[05:14:38 - 05:14:41]
demo here

[05:14:40 - 05:14:45]
so we have start with a

[05:14:41 - 05:14:46]
query okay so it's still like notebooks

[05:14:45 - 05:14:48]
but it seems like the experience is a

[05:14:46 - 05:14:51]
little bit

[05:14:48 - 05:14:52]
different okay so um and we have

[05:14:51 - 05:14:55]
generate with deep notes sure let's go

[05:14:52 - 05:14:57]
ahead and do that so uh you know write

[05:14:55 - 05:15:02]
me code that

[05:14:57 - 05:15:04]
will uh uh use Bert

[05:15:02 - 05:15:07]
for

[05:15:04 - 05:15:10]
um uh class or classification I guess

[05:15:07 - 05:15:12]
let's try that

[05:15:10 - 05:15:14]
so we're getting some code here I mean

[05:15:12 - 05:15:16]
looks a little bit different but it just

[05:15:14 - 05:15:19]
seems like they have more richer

[05:15:16 - 05:15:22]
components okay and so I suppose before

[05:15:19 - 05:15:25]
we run this like the code's fine here we

[05:15:22 - 05:15:25]
can add another code

[05:15:27 - 05:15:33]
block okay so might put this here the

[05:15:31 - 05:15:37]
blocks are a bit chunkier that's for

[05:15:33 - 05:15:37]
sure how do I add blocks in between

[05:15:39 - 05:15:43]
uh yeah I mean it's different maybe just

[05:15:41 - 05:15:44]
keep it as a single block but definitely

[05:15:43 - 05:15:47]
a different experience but if it works

[05:15:44 - 05:15:47]
it works

[05:15:49 - 05:15:53]
right okay let's just give it a

[05:15:56 - 05:16:01]
run fair enough there are there are none

[05:15:59 - 05:16:04]
I'm just not sure exactly how

[05:16:01 - 05:16:06]
to add

[05:16:04 - 05:16:08]
cells they don't make this very

[05:16:06 - 05:16:10]
clear okay so we'll go ahead and grab

[05:16:08 - 05:16:11]
this we'll bring it down here I again I

[05:16:10 - 05:16:16]
thought this was just going to be

[05:16:11 - 05:16:16]
Jupiter notebooks we'll do pip install

[05:16:16 - 05:16:19]
Transformers here they're suggesting

[05:16:18 - 05:16:21]
that but that's fine I'm going to go

[05:16:19 - 05:16:21]
ahead and do

[05:16:23 - 05:16:26]
that like is this a good experience I'm

[05:16:25 - 05:16:29]
not

[05:16:26 - 05:16:31]
sure it's just different um never seen a

[05:16:29 - 05:16:34]
never seen a platform like this we'll

[05:16:31 - 05:16:39]
bring in torch as well probably need

[05:16:34 - 05:16:39]
that that's probably all we need

[05:16:40 - 05:16:44]
Y and so let's go ahead and run this

[05:16:46 - 05:16:50]
one okay can I just run this

[05:16:51 - 05:16:55]
one definitely a bit of a learning curve

[05:16:55 - 05:17:00]
here just let me run it let me run it

[05:16:59 - 05:17:02]
let me run it I think right now it

[05:17:00 - 05:17:04]
thinks it's something else maybe I go to

[05:17:02 - 05:17:06]
go to code here there we go that's why

[05:17:04 - 05:17:08]
okay I see so I down here I was here in

[05:17:06 - 05:17:10]
this block okay it's like I can I'm not

[05:17:08 - 05:17:12]
sure if can drag blocks around but

[05:17:10 - 05:17:14]
anyway we'll go ahead and run this see

[05:17:12 - 05:17:16]
if that works we're not trying to think

[05:17:14 - 05:17:18]
too hard about what's going on here but

[05:17:16 - 05:17:21]
it's bringing in the Bert uh Bert base

[05:17:18 - 05:17:24]
uncased one and it creates a custom data

[05:17:21 - 05:17:25]
set um It prepares the data it's going

[05:17:24 - 05:17:28]
to create a training Loop I'm not really

[05:17:25 - 05:17:31]
interested in understanding this I I do

[05:17:28 - 05:17:32]
understand it but um I just want to see

[05:17:31 - 05:17:35]
it work right so it's going to just

[05:17:32 - 05:17:35]
train the

[05:17:36 - 05:17:40]
model so then once the model's trained

[05:17:38 - 05:17:43]
it's not necessarily we're not

[05:17:40 - 05:17:44]
necessarily using it here okay but it

[05:17:43 - 05:17:47]
seems like it's working no problem there

[05:17:44 - 05:17:49]
we go so that worked and uh the only

[05:17:47 - 05:17:51]
thing is like how would I use the model

[05:17:49 - 05:17:51]
now I'm not really worried about it but

[05:17:51 - 05:17:54]
I just wanted to see what that

[05:17:51 - 05:17:55]
experience is like so you create an app

[05:17:54 - 05:17:57]
from

[05:17:55 - 05:18:01]
this

[05:17:57 - 05:18:02]
okay so yeah I guess that's deep note

[05:18:01 - 05:18:06]
really was expecting something more of

[05:18:02 - 05:18:07]
like Jupiter Labs but um you know it's

[05:18:06 - 05:18:09]
something so I guess we're just going to

[05:18:07 - 05:18:10]
add it to our list of things we can

[05:18:09 - 05:18:13]
utilize let just go back here and take a

[05:18:10 - 05:18:16]
look at the main website here

[05:18:13 - 05:18:17]
um I guess they have a lot of data data

[05:18:16 - 05:18:20]
engineering integration so that's kind

[05:18:17 - 05:18:22]
of interesting I was more interested in

[05:18:20 - 05:18:25]
the machine learning parts of it so they

[05:18:22 - 05:18:28]
can apparently serve a model from a

[05:18:25 - 05:18:30]
notebook so not exactly sure but yeah

[05:18:28 - 05:18:31]
there we go yeah we have guess we have

[05:18:30 - 05:18:33]
Integrations here on the side maybe we

[05:18:31 - 05:18:36]
go back and take a look

[05:18:33 - 05:18:40]
here so yeah it really is more data data

[05:18:36 - 05:18:42]
Focus let's go here data brows aable

[05:18:40 - 05:18:44]
Integrations

[05:18:42 - 05:18:47]
okay yeah anyway I'm not sure if we'll

[05:18:44 - 05:18:49]
come back to this or not but uh and then

[05:18:47 - 05:18:51]
we have our compute over

[05:18:49 - 05:18:53]
here so yeah we can switch over to gpus

[05:18:51 - 05:18:55]
but you know maybe this is something

[05:18:53 - 05:18:57]
we'll revisit if need be okay but yeah

[05:18:55 - 05:19:00]
there you go that's deep

[05:18:57 - 05:19:03]
[Music]

[05:19:00 - 05:19:04]
note hey this is Andrew Brown in this

[05:19:03 - 05:19:06]
video we're going to take a look at

[05:19:04 - 05:19:09]
setting up cond and Jupiter Labs locally

[05:19:06 - 05:19:11]
I'm logged into remotely

[05:19:09 - 05:19:13]
um a machine on my network which is uh

[05:19:11 - 05:19:16]
the Intel developer kit um that has a

[05:19:13 - 05:19:18]
lunar Lake chip so that I can do good

[05:19:16 - 05:19:21]
things locally uh this is a very

[05:19:18 - 05:19:24]
important video as I feel that if you

[05:19:21 - 05:19:28]
have a decent uh GPU or CPU um that

[05:19:24 - 05:19:30]
there's a lot that you can do um uh with

[05:19:28 - 05:19:31]
this here if you don't plan to use gpus

[05:19:30 - 05:19:34]
or CPUs but do local development and

[05:19:31 - 05:19:36]
just use serverless apis you still would

[05:19:34 - 05:19:38]
want to do this okay so I've opened up

[05:19:36 - 05:19:39]
vs code and I have a terminal here

[05:19:38 - 05:19:41]
there's some existing project but we're

[05:19:39 - 05:19:42]
going to ignore that for now because

[05:19:41 - 05:19:44]
that doesn't really matter but what I

[05:19:42 - 05:19:48]
want to do is I want to go ahead and

[05:19:44 - 05:19:51]
install um uh Jupiter and so I actually

[05:19:48 - 05:19:53]
already have um some instructions to do

[05:19:51 - 05:19:56]
this and so I might just bring them on

[05:19:53 - 05:19:59]
over uh into this project here so I'm

[05:19:56 - 05:20:01]
going to go and uh get that open here

[05:19:59 - 05:20:03]
just give me a second I'm going to just

[05:20:01 - 05:20:06]
manage two environments at the same time

[05:20:03 - 05:20:11]
here but I'm going to go over to

[05:20:06 - 05:20:13]
GitHub and in here I have a repo called

[05:20:11 - 05:20:15]
exam

[05:20:13 - 05:20:17]
proo

[05:20:15 - 05:20:20]
[Music]

[05:20:17 - 05:20:22]
ji Essentials is what it should be

[05:20:20 - 05:20:25]
called there we go and so in here we can

[05:20:22 - 05:20:26]
set up the instructions for installation

[05:20:25 - 05:20:27]
so I'm going to just hit period on my

[05:20:26 - 05:20:30]
keyboard and as that's going I'm going

[05:20:27 - 05:20:32]
to go over to GitHub as I have a lot of

[05:20:30 - 05:20:34]
projects I have the ji Training Day

[05:20:32 - 05:20:36]
workshops and in this one here we

[05:20:34 - 05:20:38]
actually already have the code for us uh

[05:20:36 - 05:20:40]
over here okay so I just want to bring

[05:20:38 - 05:20:43]
it over and kind of rework it a little

[05:20:40 - 05:20:46]
bit for our use case so I'm going to go

[05:20:43 - 05:20:46]
and wait a moment

[05:20:46 - 05:20:50]
here and I'm going to just make a new

[05:20:48 - 05:20:51]
folder here oops not there we're going

[05:20:50 - 05:20:57]
to make a new folder here I'm going to

[05:20:51 - 05:20:59]
call this one um uh cond local like cond

[05:20:57 - 05:21:02]
Jupiter or we'll say local development

[05:20:59 - 05:21:09]
local Dev and I'll make a new folder in

[05:21:02 - 05:21:09]
here this will be K and Jupiter okay

[05:21:10 - 05:21:13]
so we're going to make a new file here

[05:21:12 - 05:21:15]
and I'm just going to call it uh a

[05:21:13 - 05:21:18]
readme.md as this will be the

[05:21:15 - 05:21:19]
instructions to get set up here and so

[05:21:18 - 05:21:21]
the first thing we'll want to do is

[05:21:19 - 05:21:26]
we'll want to install

[05:21:21 - 05:21:28]
miniconda Okay so install

[05:21:26 - 05:21:30]
miniconda if you've never heard of cond

[05:21:28 - 05:21:30]
before or

[05:21:32 - 05:21:36]
miniconda which is over here

[05:21:39 - 05:21:45]
um so first let's talk about andaconda

[05:21:42 - 05:21:47]
so andaconda um I I think of it as a

[05:21:45 - 05:21:50]
package manager but basically it gives

[05:21:47 - 05:21:53]
you um a package manager and trusted

[05:21:50 - 05:21:55]
libraries that are commonly used uh for

[05:21:53 - 05:21:57]
people that are data scientists or in

[05:21:55 - 05:22:00]
the data field so this is a very common

[05:21:57 - 05:22:01]
way to start working with um libraries

[05:22:00 - 05:22:03]
and to not deal with so many different

[05:22:01 - 05:22:06]
kinds of conflicts but what we're going

[05:22:03 - 05:22:09]
to want to do is install uh minondo this

[05:22:06 - 05:22:11]
is specifically for ubun too here it's

[05:22:09 - 05:22:13]
making a a folder in the home directory

[05:22:11 - 05:22:16]
doesn't necessarily need to do that but

[05:22:13 - 05:22:17]
it's not going to hurt anything um and

[05:22:16 - 05:22:19]
so we're going to go ahead and run it

[05:22:17 - 05:22:20]
here you can run this on a Mac even if

[05:22:19 - 05:22:23]
you don't have a home directory you can

[05:22:20 - 05:22:24]
still do this but um actually I'm just

[05:22:23 - 05:22:27]
trying to decide here should we change

[05:22:24 - 05:22:29]
this at

[05:22:27 - 05:22:31]
all I think what I'd rather do here I'm

[05:22:29 - 05:22:33]
just going to change it slightly so I

[05:22:31 - 05:22:37]
want to put this in the home directory

[05:22:33 - 05:22:40]
and then here we will then do this okay

[05:22:37 - 05:22:42]
and that way um it will go wherever your

[05:22:40 - 05:22:44]
your one is because mine's called Andrew

[05:22:42 - 05:22:46]
right and so I'm just copying each line

[05:22:44 - 05:22:49]
over okay this is something that you'll

[05:22:46 - 05:22:51]
have access to you can get it at jny

[05:22:49 - 05:22:54]
Essentials right so I'm going to bring

[05:22:51 - 05:22:56]
in that first line which um you know

[05:22:54 - 05:22:57]
what I don't really sorry that's not the

[05:22:56 - 05:23:00]
right line there we go that's the line

[05:22:57 - 05:23:02]
we want okay and then we want the next

[05:23:00 - 05:23:05]
line which will actually download um the

[05:23:02 - 05:23:08]
latest version of

[05:23:05 - 05:23:11]
miniconda okay and then the last one

[05:23:08 - 05:23:13]
here actually executes it so here it's

[05:23:11 - 05:23:14]
downloading A bash file and renaming it

[05:23:13 - 05:23:18]
to Temp miniconda and then we're

[05:23:14 - 05:23:18]
executing it here which will install

[05:23:22 - 05:23:27]
miniconda okay so it's installed now so

[05:23:24 - 05:23:29]
that's step one installing miniconda the

[05:23:27 - 05:23:32]
next step is

[05:23:29 - 05:23:35]
to um get it set up so these are the

[05:23:32 - 05:23:36]
first two lines we want to run so we's

[05:23:35 - 05:23:40]
just say

[05:23:36 - 05:23:40]
setup miniconda

[05:23:40 - 05:23:46]
I might just make this uh

[05:23:43 - 05:23:46]
H2 not that it

[05:23:49 - 05:23:53]
matters okay and I'm just going to

[05:23:51 - 05:23:57]
slightly change this so it's actually

[05:23:53 - 05:23:58]
this here okay and we'll go ahead and

[05:23:57 - 05:24:00]
bring those in

[05:23:58 - 05:24:02]
next have to be a little bit careful

[05:24:00 - 05:24:04]
here as it likes to um when you copy

[05:24:02 - 05:24:07]
paste on Windows it likes to not copy

[05:24:04 - 05:24:07]
what you have

[05:24:08 - 05:24:14]
and it's

[05:24:09 - 05:24:16]
still it's still uh refusing to work

[05:24:14 - 05:24:19]
there we

[05:24:16 - 05:24:21]
go so I've done the activate and so now

[05:24:19 - 05:24:23]
notice that we have base so now

[05:24:21 - 05:24:25]
miniconda is working this is really

[05:24:23 - 05:24:27]
important so that um you know that it's

[05:24:25 - 05:24:29]
there if you don't see this then uh cond

[05:24:27 - 05:24:31]
is not there okay and the next line is

[05:24:29 - 05:24:33]
the cond and it all so this is going to

[05:24:31 - 05:24:36]
set up uh some defaults so it's modified

[05:24:33 - 05:24:39]
some files and if we were to open up

[05:24:36 - 05:24:40]
this file like our bash RC or Zs HRC I'm

[05:24:39 - 05:24:42]
not sure which one we are using right

[05:24:40 - 05:24:44]
here I'm just going to cat it out here

[05:24:42 - 05:24:46]
for a second it's added stuff so that

[05:24:44 - 05:24:48]
next time we use terminal the condo will

[05:24:46 - 05:24:50]
get loaded if you don't run that line

[05:24:48 - 05:24:51]
then you'll always have to activate

[05:24:50 - 05:24:55]
condo which is kind of

[05:24:51 - 05:24:57]
annoying so anyway now we have uh cond

[05:24:55 - 05:24:59]
installed and so the next step is to

[05:24:57 - 05:25:00]
like get our environment ready and so

[05:24:59 - 05:25:02]
often what we'll end up doing is we'll

[05:25:00 - 05:25:06]
be creating a

[05:25:02 - 05:25:08]
um uh like an environment and then from

[05:25:06 - 05:25:09]
there doing something with it so let's

[05:25:08 - 05:25:11]
let's actually go ahead and do that now

[05:25:09 - 05:25:13]
we're not going to do open V here today

[05:25:11 - 05:25:14]
uh but we're going to do something else

[05:25:13 - 05:25:17]
and I'm just going to make a very simple

[05:25:14 - 05:25:20]
environment so we'll just say um create

[05:25:17 - 05:25:20]
a new

[05:25:22 - 05:25:28]
environment

[05:25:24 - 05:25:32]
okay and so what that will do here just

[05:25:28 - 05:25:35]
call um call it hello right this will

[05:25:32 - 05:25:41]
create a new um python environment call

[05:25:35 - 05:25:43]
hello with Python 3 10 often um I will

[05:25:41 - 05:25:45]
use an older version of python because

[05:25:43 - 05:25:47]
newer versions of python especially when

[05:25:45 - 05:25:50]
working in data science projects you'll

[05:25:47 - 05:25:52]
have serious conflicts with libraries

[05:25:50 - 05:25:54]
and so you just kind of find which one's

[05:25:52 - 05:25:55]
more reliable for you so latest is not

[05:25:54 - 05:25:56]
always the best there's definitely a

[05:25:55 - 05:25:58]
newer version of python and so I'm

[05:25:56 - 05:26:00]
making the deliberate choice of working

[05:25:58 - 05:26:03]
with 3.10 if it's the future you just

[05:26:00 - 05:26:05]
kind of figure out as you go um what

[05:26:03 - 05:26:07]
versions work for you but right now at

[05:26:05 - 05:26:09]
this time 3.10 is working great for me

[05:26:07 - 05:26:12]
and I'm sticking with it so I'm going to

[05:26:09 - 05:26:13]
go ahead here and we're going to go and

[05:26:12 - 05:26:15]
uh create ourselves a new python

[05:26:13 - 05:26:16]
environment now normally when you create

[05:26:15 - 05:26:18]
a python environment it would just

[05:26:16 - 05:26:20]
create it in place I'm not exactly sure

[05:26:18 - 05:26:21]
where they place these but we'll take a

[05:26:20 - 05:26:24]
look here I'm just going to do an LS

[05:26:21 - 05:26:26]
hyphen La so notice that like the python

[05:26:24 - 05:26:29]
environment is not there so what we can

[05:26:26 - 05:26:31]
do is type in cond EnV and it should

[05:26:29 - 05:26:32]
tell us cond EnV it should tell us about

[05:26:31 - 05:26:34]
the environment maybe it's not that

[05:26:32 - 05:26:39]
maybe cond

[05:26:34 - 05:26:43]
show so type in cond here oh it's cond

[05:26:39 - 05:26:43]
info so we type in cond

[05:26:43 - 05:26:48]
info I'm just seeing if it tells us

[05:26:46 - 05:26:50]
where this environment currently is we

[05:26:48 - 05:26:52]
haven't activated it yet so there is no

[05:26:50 - 05:26:53]
um environment but this would be you

[05:26:52 - 05:26:57]
know

[05:26:53 - 05:27:01]
create create a new python

[05:26:57 - 05:27:05]
environment called hello with python uh

[05:27:01 - 05:27:07]
version 3.10 okay and so if we want to

[05:27:05 - 05:27:10]
use the environment like activate the

[05:27:07 - 05:27:10]
environment

[05:27:10 - 05:27:16]
we would write um

[05:27:12 - 05:27:19]
cond activate

[05:27:16 - 05:27:19]
hello

[05:27:24 - 05:27:29]
okay and it's saying

[05:27:26 - 05:27:30]
here could not find an environment

[05:27:29 - 05:27:33]
called that I could have swore that we

[05:27:30 - 05:27:33]
created it right did we

[05:27:34 - 05:27:38]
not I mean this one's called open V so

[05:27:36 - 05:27:40]
maybe when I copi paste it it created

[05:27:38 - 05:27:42]
one called open voo which is not a big

[05:27:40 - 05:27:44]
deal so I'm going to try this again and

[05:27:42 - 05:27:47]
so now created it it's just that copy

[05:27:44 - 05:27:48]
paste that messes things up okay so I'm

[05:27:47 - 05:27:50]
going to go here and say hello so now

[05:27:48 - 05:27:51]
I'm using hello you can see this here it

[05:27:50 - 05:27:53]
says

[05:27:51 - 05:27:55]
hello and uh it's not easy to like to

[05:27:53 - 05:27:57]
list out environments I've never figured

[05:27:55 - 05:27:58]
that out but if we go conduit info now

[05:27:57 - 05:27:59]
should tell us does it tell us what

[05:27:58 - 05:28:01]
environment we're using so it's telling

[05:27:59 - 05:28:03]
us we're using this environment and it's

[05:28:01 - 05:28:06]
located here so I have a feeling if we

[05:28:03 - 05:28:08]
were to copy this we could then um or

[05:28:06 - 05:28:09]
write this out home Andrew minond

[05:28:08 - 05:28:12]
environments we could find it so let's

[05:28:09 - 05:28:15]
go ahead and we'll type in miniconda

[05:28:12 - 05:28:17]
envs and I'm going to just do lsy and LA

[05:28:15 - 05:28:18]
to list them all so we have hello and

[05:28:17 - 05:28:20]
open voo so I believe that if we want to

[05:28:18 - 05:28:22]
delete it I mean we could manually

[05:28:20 - 05:28:25]
delete it but the proper way would be to

[05:28:22 - 05:28:28]
um remove It Whatever the command is so

[05:28:25 - 05:28:31]
if we go here they call it

[05:28:28 - 05:28:36]
remove okay so we'll go over to

[05:28:31 - 05:28:39]
here and I'm just say get info about

[05:28:36 - 05:28:42]
current environment

[05:28:39 - 05:28:45]
and this is going to be

[05:28:42 - 05:28:49]
cond uh

[05:28:45 - 05:28:51]
info we can see things like where the

[05:28:49 - 05:28:53]
Nar

[05:28:51 - 05:28:57]
exists or the

[05:28:53 - 05:28:59]
environment uh python environment

[05:28:57 - 05:29:01]
exists so let's say we're done with this

[05:28:59 - 05:29:02]
we can remove it so remove an

[05:29:01 - 05:29:04]
environment and this is something you

[05:29:02 - 05:29:05]
actually do quite a bit because often

[05:29:04 - 05:29:07]
you will install things you'll have

[05:29:05 - 05:29:08]
you'll make a mess of things and you

[05:29:07 - 05:29:10]
just basically have to uh delete and

[05:29:08 - 05:29:12]
start over so I'm doing this all the

[05:29:10 - 05:29:14]
time before you can do that you have to

[05:29:12 - 05:29:15]
deactivate you can't just delete it if

[05:29:14 - 05:29:17]
you have it activated so we say

[05:29:15 - 05:29:23]
deactivate hello I think that's maybe

[05:29:17 - 05:29:23]
what it is say cond deactivate

[05:29:24 - 05:29:31]
hello um it's not

[05:29:28 - 05:29:33]
that is it not just deactivate oh it is

[05:29:31 - 05:29:35]
deactivate I probably just spelled it

[05:29:33 - 05:29:40]
wrong so try oh you know what it's just

[05:29:35 - 05:29:40]
cond of deactivate because you can't um

[05:29:40 - 05:29:43]
specify exact one I'm not sure why they

[05:29:42 - 05:29:45]
made that as a choice it's just kind of

[05:29:43 - 05:29:49]
a habit of me always typing

[05:29:45 - 05:29:50]
it and so now we can say cond remove and

[05:29:49 - 05:29:54]
this one's a little bit funny because

[05:29:50 - 05:29:58]
you have to specify a flag for it and

[05:29:54 - 05:30:01]
here it's cond to remove hyphen name my

[05:29:58 - 05:30:04]
EnV and then hyphen all so that's what

[05:30:01 - 05:30:05]
you're supposed to do oh I mean we have

[05:30:04 - 05:30:08]
to actually name it what it is so we

[05:30:05 - 05:30:10]
have hello here

[05:30:08 - 05:30:13]
and we'll say

[05:30:10 - 05:30:15]
yes yes and I think open Vos here as

[05:30:13 - 05:30:17]
well so go ahead and do that I'll just

[05:30:15 - 05:30:20]
switch that out um I don't want have to

[05:30:17 - 05:30:21]
put the the Y flag every time so just do

[05:30:20 - 05:30:23]
that like that obviously you should read

[05:30:21 - 05:30:24]
what you're deleting and so that's

[05:30:23 - 05:30:28]
example there so I'm going to go back

[05:30:24 - 05:30:30]
over to here so this will be cond

[05:30:28 - 05:30:32]
remove every time time I say cond it

[05:30:30 - 05:30:35]
sounds like in my head what cond and I

[05:30:32 - 05:30:38]
just think of that movie um but they say

[05:30:35 - 05:30:39]
hello here and then it's hyphen hyen all

[05:30:38 - 05:30:41]
and then it's hyphen yes and so that's

[05:30:39 - 05:30:45]
how we're going to

[05:30:41 - 05:30:46]
remove uh remove uh an environment so

[05:30:45 - 05:30:49]
something you're going to be commonly

[05:30:46 - 05:30:52]
doing now there's more to this um this

[05:30:49 - 05:30:55]
is basically step one which will just be

[05:30:52 - 05:30:59]
uh setup cond we'll just call this cond

[05:30:55 - 05:31:00]
instead okay and the next part will

[05:30:59 - 05:31:03]
actually be installing stuff and

[05:31:00 - 05:31:08]
specifically what we want to install is

[05:31:03 - 05:31:10]
um uh Jupiter lab but um yeah we'll

[05:31:08 - 05:31:12]
cover libraries installed in the next

[05:31:10 - 05:31:14]
one here but uh one thing I wonder is

[05:31:12 - 05:31:15]
like do we have Pip now so I didn't have

[05:31:14 - 05:31:17]
this before which was kind of

[05:31:15 - 05:31:20]
frustrating if we type in PIP yeah we

[05:31:17 - 05:31:24]
have Pip okay great okay so what I'll

[05:31:20 - 05:31:25]
do is I'm going to uh stop the video

[05:31:24 - 05:31:26]
here and then we're going to continue on

[05:31:25 - 05:31:28]
as a separate one but I'm going to save

[05:31:26 - 05:31:29]
this here for now because this one's

[05:31:28 - 05:31:31]
pretty

[05:31:29 - 05:31:33]
good and we'll say

[05:31:31 - 05:31:35]
update I I almost feel like I should

[05:31:33 - 05:31:37]
have made this a separate one maybe I'll

[05:31:35 - 05:31:39]
just rename this a cond I'm so sorry for

[05:31:37 - 05:31:43]
those that are

[05:31:39 - 05:31:45]
watching and I'll rename this to read me

[05:31:43 - 05:31:46]
but that way the next one can be Jupiter

[05:31:45 - 05:31:49]
server

[05:31:46 - 05:31:52]
okay okay and I will see you in the next

[05:31:49 - 05:31:52]
one Chia

[05:31:53 - 05:32:00]
[Music]

[05:31:56 - 05:32:02]
Chow all right so my last video um we

[05:32:00 - 05:32:05]
installed cond we have it here as the

[05:32:02 - 05:32:06]
base um normally the next thing I want

[05:32:05 - 05:32:08]
to show you is Jupiter lab but what I

[05:32:06 - 05:32:11]
actually want to show you is how could

[05:32:08 - 05:32:12]
you use cond specifically in vs code

[05:32:11 - 05:32:15]
because that's where you're really going

[05:32:12 - 05:32:17]
to want to use it um also in jupyter lab

[05:32:15 - 05:32:19]
of course um and so you know we just

[05:32:17 - 05:32:21]
need some kind of random project to work

[05:32:19 - 05:32:25]
on and so I'm just going to go here and

[05:32:21 - 05:32:27]
make a new um uh file so I'm going to go

[05:32:25 - 05:32:29]
back here for a second and it really

[05:32:27 - 05:32:32]
doesn't matter what it is so I'm just

[05:32:29 - 05:32:34]
going to say mkd hello and I'm going to

[05:32:32 - 05:32:35]
CD into hello and I'm just going to open

[05:32:34 - 05:32:37]
this up in vs code so I'm doing code

[05:32:35 - 05:32:39]
period if you don't have that installed

[05:32:37 - 05:32:40]
it will install it and then it will let

[05:32:39 - 05:32:42]
you open it up like this close out the

[05:32:40 - 05:32:43]
old on so you just don't get mixed up

[05:32:42 - 05:32:45]
that can get kind of confusing if you

[05:32:43 - 05:32:47]
don't do that I'm going to go ahead here

[05:32:45 - 05:32:49]
on the right hand side I'm going to make

[05:32:47 - 05:32:51]
a new file called

[05:32:49 - 05:32:54]
app.py okay and so if I open up

[05:32:51 - 05:32:56]
terminal notice that cond is loaded as

[05:32:54 - 05:32:58]
we see the word base if you don't see

[05:32:56 - 05:33:00]
that then there's something wrong with

[05:32:58 - 05:33:01]
your installation you have to fix it the

[05:33:00 - 05:33:03]
other reason you might not see it is if

[05:33:01 - 05:33:05]
you install some kind of fancy thing

[05:33:03 - 05:33:08]
that uh colors or or makes this more

[05:33:05 - 05:33:09]
convenient it could overwrite that so

[05:33:08 - 05:33:11]
you could still have it there but just

[05:33:09 - 05:33:14]
consider those could be issues that

[05:33:11 - 05:33:16]
you're having so you know every time you

[05:33:14 - 05:33:17]
work on a project you should create a

[05:33:16 - 05:33:19]
separate environment for each one

[05:33:17 - 05:33:21]
absolutely you should do that um and

[05:33:19 - 05:33:23]
don't work in bass I try not to install

[05:33:21 - 05:33:25]
anything in bass if you do there is a

[05:33:23 - 05:33:27]
way to clear out bass I don't do it very

[05:33:25 - 05:33:29]
often so I'm I'm not sure in this video

[05:33:27 - 05:33:31]
but you can do that but try to keep bass

[05:33:29 - 05:33:32]
as clean as you can but it's going to

[05:33:31 - 05:33:33]
happen where you're going to install

[05:33:32 - 05:33:35]
things in there by accident which you

[05:33:33 - 05:33:36]
don't mean to do but the thing is that

[05:33:35 - 05:33:38]
different environments can inherit from

[05:33:36 - 05:33:40]
base and so that's why you don't want to

[05:33:38 - 05:33:42]
muddy your base um but what I want to do

[05:33:40 - 05:33:43]
is I want to create a new environment

[05:33:42 - 05:33:46]
and I honestly do not have this

[05:33:43 - 05:33:49]
memorized so I often have to look it up

[05:33:46 - 05:33:53]
um so just a moment here as I'm looking

[05:33:49 - 05:33:57]
for um the GitHub repo we just had open

[05:33:53 - 05:33:59]
here just a moment ago which is here I

[05:33:57 - 05:34:00]
believe and so I'm going to have this

[05:33:59 - 05:34:02]
off screen and and I'm going to look

[05:34:00 - 05:34:05]
smart by pretending that remember this

[05:34:02 - 05:34:06]
but it's cond to create hyphen hyen name

[05:34:05 - 05:34:07]
I wonder if you can just do hyphen name

[05:34:06 - 05:34:09]
like that that'd be nicer we're going to

[05:34:07 - 05:34:12]
do hello and I'm going to specify python

[05:34:09 - 05:34:12]
equals

[05:34:13 - 05:34:17]
3.10.1 and we'll hit enter and so it's

[05:34:15 - 05:34:18]
going to go ahead and create ourselves

[05:34:17 - 05:34:21]
that environment we need to activate it

[05:34:18 - 05:34:22]
so we type cond to activate hello again

[05:34:21 - 05:34:25]
this something going to do again and

[05:34:22 - 05:34:26]
again and again so just get used to it

[05:34:25 - 05:34:29]
um so the idea is we want to run

[05:34:26 - 05:34:33]
something here and we need some kind of

[05:34:29 - 05:34:35]
Library installed and so we can install

[05:34:33 - 05:34:38]
it a few ways one way is using cond

[05:34:35 - 05:34:42]
Forge so cond Forge um

[05:34:38 - 05:34:42]
we go here are basically trusted

[05:34:43 - 05:34:47]
libraries um that are

[05:34:45 - 05:34:48]
configured for use we go over here cond

[05:34:47 - 05:34:52]
to

[05:34:48 - 05:34:53]
forge and so we can explore it and no I

[05:34:52 - 05:34:55]
want the packages here we go so these

[05:34:53 - 05:34:57]
are all the possible packages that we

[05:34:55 - 05:35:01]
can install now we can install things

[05:34:57 - 05:35:01]
outside of the cond of Forge

[05:35:01 - 05:35:04]
but I'm not really seeing the ones I

[05:35:03 - 05:35:06]
want there's too many packages right so

[05:35:04 - 05:35:09]
if we wanted P torch we type in P torch

[05:35:06 - 05:35:11]
here right whatever we wanted we wanted

[05:35:09 - 05:35:16]
um

[05:35:11 - 05:35:16]
uh SK kit s

[05:35:16 - 05:35:20]
kit I'm not sure why I'm having to hard

[05:35:18 - 05:35:22]
type typing it in today but the point is

[05:35:20 - 05:35:24]
or like pandas if we want pandas it's

[05:35:22 - 05:35:25]
there and so let's say we wanted to work

[05:35:24 - 05:35:28]
with

[05:35:25 - 05:35:30]
pandas right um we could we could do a

[05:35:28 - 05:35:32]
pip install and sometimes you do that

[05:35:30 - 05:35:34]
but you really want to try to always do

[05:35:32 - 05:35:38]
cond cond Forge install so I'm going to

[05:35:34 - 05:35:42]
go over to here and maybe we'll continue

[05:35:38 - 05:35:45]
on here um with this so we had cond I'll

[05:35:42 - 05:35:47]
just call this one setup I'm so bad I

[05:35:45 - 05:35:51]
just keep raming these on you folks uh

[05:35:47 - 05:35:53]
we'll say hello example and so what did

[05:35:51 - 05:35:58]
we do so far um

[05:35:53 - 05:36:00]
whoops I want a hello. MD here what did

[05:35:58 - 05:36:02]
we do we we said

[05:36:00 - 05:36:06]
cond

[05:36:02 - 05:36:08]
um oronda create hyphen and hello python

[05:36:06 - 05:36:11]
3.10

[05:36:08 - 05:36:13]
zero um hyphen y that was our first

[05:36:11 - 05:36:15]
command and then our next one was cond

[05:36:13 - 05:36:16]
activate so the next thing we want to do

[05:36:15 - 05:36:19]
is we want to install so I think it's

[05:36:16 - 05:36:21]
cond install C cond Forge so what we're

[05:36:19 - 05:36:22]
saying is like we want to install

[05:36:21 - 05:36:24]
something but specifically use cond

[05:36:22 - 05:36:26]
Forge and you could specify other things

[05:36:24 - 05:36:28]
here I just don't know anything besides

[05:36:26 - 05:36:29]
cond of Forge so I often just type that

[05:36:28 - 05:36:31]
in and so we would do this we'll go

[05:36:29 - 05:36:33]
ahead and give this a

[05:36:31 - 05:36:35]
try

[05:36:33 - 05:36:37]
right and that is not what I wanted so

[05:36:35 - 05:36:38]
I'll just type it again cuz copying

[05:36:37 - 05:36:40]
between

[05:36:38 - 05:36:41]
um remote like remote desktop doesn't

[05:36:40 - 05:36:44]
always work properly so I'm just going

[05:36:41 - 05:36:46]
to type it fully in here and we'll type

[05:36:44 - 05:36:47]
in pandz right so this is now going to

[05:36:46 - 05:36:49]
install it

[05:36:47 - 05:36:51]
here now we could also create a

[05:36:49 - 05:36:53]
requirements.txt install and that's

[05:36:51 - 05:36:55]
totally fine as well but sometimes you

[05:36:53 - 05:36:56]
want to install libraries this way so

[05:36:55 - 05:37:01]
you absolutely know they're coming from

[05:36:56 - 05:37:01]
cond Forge okay so we give it a hypen y

[05:37:02 - 05:37:08]
here and so that's installing so that's

[05:37:05 - 05:37:12]
going good and so now we have cond Forge

[05:37:08 - 05:37:13]
installed or sorry pandas installed um

[05:37:12 - 05:37:16]
I'm not sure if it would show up under

[05:37:13 - 05:37:17]
cond info we can take a look here so I

[05:37:16 - 05:37:18]
don't think it would show those

[05:37:17 - 05:37:20]
libraries but if we wanted to see what

[05:37:18 - 05:37:23]
packages we

[05:37:20 - 05:37:26]
had right we do um was it PIP show I

[05:37:23 - 05:37:29]
believe PIP show or sorry pip list pip

[05:37:26 - 05:37:31]
list and so here we can see we have cond

[05:37:29 - 05:37:33]
or sorry pandis is installed here so

[05:37:31 - 05:37:35]
what I want to do is I want to do cond

[05:37:33 - 05:37:39]
deactivate let's take a look here and

[05:37:35 - 05:37:39]
we'll do pip list

[05:37:39 - 05:37:42]
and notice this comes with a lot of

[05:37:41 - 05:37:44]
stuff installed but does it have pandas

[05:37:42 - 05:37:46]
installed it does not right because this

[05:37:44 - 05:37:49]
is the base one that's installed here

[05:37:46 - 05:37:52]
I'm going to go back over to hello and

[05:37:49 - 05:37:55]
we'll do cond or sorry pip list I think

[05:37:52 - 05:37:56]
I said earlier that I I believe that um

[05:37:55 - 05:37:58]
things inherit from base but it doesn't

[05:37:56 - 05:38:00]
appear that way so I guess that's just a

[05:37:58 - 05:38:01]
false statement each environment is

[05:38:00 - 05:38:04]
completely isolated and that's actually

[05:38:01 - 05:38:06]
a lot better so here we have pandas and

[05:38:04 - 05:38:10]
so if we want to use it uh let's make

[05:38:06 - 05:38:11]
some pandas code here here um I don't

[05:38:10 - 05:38:13]
want to figure it out I'm not great at

[05:38:11 - 05:38:15]
Panda so I'm going to over to chat GPT

[05:38:13 - 05:38:18]
or whatever you want to go to whatever

[05:38:15 - 05:38:20]
free uh model you want want to use I'm

[05:38:18 - 05:38:25]
just over here I'm just give give me

[05:38:20 - 05:38:28]
like give me a basic uh example of

[05:38:25 - 05:38:29]
pandis okay we'll go ahead and do that

[05:38:28 - 05:38:32]
should be using mini because I get

[05:38:29 - 05:38:32]
limited uses of

[05:38:33 - 05:38:36]
gpt1 and we'll give it a moment here

[05:38:35 - 05:38:38]
we've already installed it so I'm going

[05:38:36 - 05:38:40]
to grab this is a example you do

[05:38:38 - 05:38:43]
whatever you want as a basic

[05:38:40 - 05:38:44]
example okay we have a basic data frame

[05:38:43 - 05:38:47]
we just want to make sure that it works

[05:38:44 - 05:38:49]
that's all that matters to us here okay

[05:38:47 - 05:38:53]
so we have this here I'm going to go

[05:38:49 - 05:38:56]
ahead and I'm going to um run this so if

[05:38:53 - 05:38:58]
I do LS we have the

[05:38:56 - 05:39:02]
app.py so do

[05:38:58 - 05:39:04]
Python app.py and notice that we can use

[05:39:02 - 05:39:06]
the word python as opposed to Python 3

[05:39:04 - 05:39:08]
because it should be routed to that

[05:39:06 - 05:39:09]
location one thing you might want to

[05:39:08 - 05:39:12]
check when you're using python is where

[05:39:09 - 05:39:14]
it is so say where is Python and so it's

[05:39:12 - 05:39:16]
showing that it's loading for miniconda

[05:39:14 - 05:39:17]
there have been cases where I've had to

[05:39:16 - 05:39:18]
use Python 3 which is kind of annoying

[05:39:17 - 05:39:21]
but we can type that in as well say

[05:39:18 - 05:39:23]
where is Python 3 sometimes both are

[05:39:21 - 05:39:25]
installed sometimes only one's installed

[05:39:23 - 05:39:27]
but you can see that um it looks like

[05:39:25 - 05:39:29]
Python 3 there's probably a local one

[05:39:27 - 05:39:31]
here so the local installed version

[05:39:29 - 05:39:33]
outside of cond is that one but clearly

[05:39:31 - 05:39:35]
want to use Python uh I know it's

[05:39:33 - 05:39:37]
confusing but it's just how it is but

[05:39:35 - 05:39:40]
anyway I think that worked right did our

[05:39:37 - 05:39:42]
file work it did okay so if you want to

[05:39:40 - 05:39:45]
run this as well I I'll go copy it over

[05:39:42 - 05:39:47]
here to our uh

[05:39:45 - 05:39:50]
repo over

[05:39:47 - 05:39:50]
here

[05:39:52 - 05:39:55]
app.py and so we'll go back over to this

[05:39:54 - 05:39:59]
and we'll just do a bit of documentation

[05:39:55 - 05:40:03]
so we had cond install we had cond uh or

[05:39:59 - 05:40:05]
so we had PIP show or sorry pip list

[05:40:03 - 05:40:05]
then we had cond

[05:40:05 - 05:40:11]
deactivate and then we we had pip list

[05:40:09 - 05:40:15]
we have uh cond activate

[05:40:11 - 05:40:18]
hello and then we do python

[05:40:15 - 05:40:18]
app.py okay so this

[05:40:19 - 05:40:24]
is um hello

[05:40:21 - 05:40:24]
example

[05:40:25 - 05:40:34]
and so here we are creating our uh hello

[05:40:31 - 05:40:39]
environment we uh install

[05:40:34 - 05:40:41]
pandas in our uh hello en

[05:40:39 - 05:40:45]
environment we

[05:40:41 - 05:40:47]
observe which packages are

[05:40:45 - 05:40:50]
installed we

[05:40:47 - 05:40:53]
observe which

[05:40:50 - 05:40:55]
packages are installed in

[05:40:53 - 05:40:57]
base it's good to make notes like even

[05:40:55 - 05:40:58]
if like this is really simple just going

[05:40:57 - 05:41:00]
through the habit of doing this really

[05:40:58 - 05:41:03]
helps commit it to long-term memory for

[05:41:00 - 05:41:05]
yourself uh and so I just that's why I

[05:41:03 - 05:41:06]
always do this is it's kind of like your

[05:41:05 - 05:41:10]
opportunity to do it like two three

[05:41:06 - 05:41:13]
times over uh we can use Python uh

[05:41:10 - 05:41:18]
python uh binary to

[05:41:13 - 05:41:23]
execute U the python in the context of

[05:41:18 - 05:41:23]
cond and we can type in where is

[05:41:23 - 05:41:31]
python check the check which uh uh what

[05:41:29 - 05:41:33]
binary is being

[05:41:31 - 05:41:35]
loaded

[05:41:33 - 05:41:38]
okay we do where

[05:41:35 - 05:41:40]
is Python 3 one thing we might also want

[05:41:38 - 05:41:41]
to check out is like what if we did a uh

[05:41:40 - 05:41:44]
requirements.txt here and we're not

[05:41:41 - 05:41:46]
using the for it should still

[05:41:44 - 05:41:48]
work

[05:41:46 - 05:41:49]
okay and so I need some kind of Library

[05:41:48 - 05:41:52]
here we'll just say

[05:41:49 - 05:41:54]
torch and so I'm going to go here and do

[05:41:52 - 05:41:57]
pip install hyphen R

[05:41:54 - 05:41:57]
requirements.txt

[05:42:00 - 05:42:05]
okay so it's installing no problem here

[05:42:03 - 05:42:07]
I maybe I shouldn't have installed torch

[05:42:05 - 05:42:08]
because that takes a bit of time

[05:42:07 - 05:42:10]
yeah it's a little bit large so I'm just

[05:42:08 - 05:42:12]
going to stop that and you'll notice

[05:42:10 - 05:42:14]
like torch is almost like um a gigabyte

[05:42:12 - 05:42:17]
so you might want to clean up your

[05:42:14 - 05:42:18]
environments from time to time maybe I

[05:42:17 - 05:42:22]
should have chose something

[05:42:18 - 05:42:25]
smaller uh you know like python. EMV

[05:42:22 - 05:42:27]
we'll end up using that quite a bit so

[05:42:25 - 05:42:31]
python

[05:42:27 - 05:42:34]
Dov so do um pip install hyphen R

[05:42:31 - 05:42:36]
requirements.txt so it'll install from

[05:42:34 - 05:42:41]
that file here okay so that's really

[05:42:36 - 05:42:44]
good um I'll go back over to here and

[05:42:41 - 05:42:44]
I'll just make a new requirements

[05:42:47 - 05:42:53]
here uh this will be just python just

[05:42:50 - 05:42:55]
again writing it again python.

[05:42:53 - 05:42:56]
EnV that's so we can load environment

[05:42:55 - 05:42:58]
variables and actually we'll use that

[05:42:56 - 05:43:00]
quite a bit so that one's a good example

[05:42:58 - 05:43:03]
to have here we'll go back over to our

[05:43:00 - 05:43:07]
read what else did we do we did um uh

[05:43:03 - 05:43:10]
python or sorry pip install

[05:43:07 - 05:43:12]
requirements.txt has have a hyphen R in

[05:43:10 - 05:43:14]
front of it if you forget it don't worry

[05:43:12 - 05:43:15]
like after a week of me not working with

[05:43:14 - 05:43:17]
python I always forget that command

[05:43:15 - 05:43:20]
we'll do pip pip list again here because

[05:43:17 - 05:43:23]
I want to see if it installed it so we

[05:43:20 - 05:43:25]
have python python. EMV here another

[05:43:23 - 05:43:28]
thing that I should show you is um

[05:43:25 - 05:43:31]
working with not Jupiter Labs but it's

[05:43:28 - 05:43:33]
the environment specifically for um vs

[05:43:31 - 05:43:35]
code so we'll do that in the next video

[05:43:33 - 05:43:36]
here and so I'm just going to stop it

[05:43:35 - 05:43:37]
I'm going to keep this environment

[05:43:36 - 05:43:39]
around because this one's useful for us

[05:43:37 - 05:43:44]
I'm going to go ahead and just quickly

[05:43:39 - 05:43:44]
Commit This code here so we have it for

[05:43:47 - 05:43:51]
later not sure if that's really the

[05:43:49 - 05:43:53]
right commit messages but no one judged

[05:43:51 - 05:43:54]
me on my commit messages okay see you in

[05:43:53 - 05:43:58]
the next

[05:43:54 - 05:44:00]
[Music]

[05:43:58 - 05:44:02]
one all right so in this video what I

[05:44:00 - 05:44:05]
want to show you is how to use the

[05:44:02 - 05:44:07]
notebook like experience within um vs

[05:44:05 - 05:44:11]
code with cond so we already figured out

[05:44:07 - 05:44:12]
how to do that um obviously with um uh

[05:44:11 - 05:44:14]
Cloud environments but if we want to get

[05:44:12 - 05:44:17]
this set up locally we're going to need

[05:44:14 - 05:44:18]
a couple of extensions or maybe well at

[05:44:17 - 05:44:20]
least we're going to need Jupiter but

[05:44:18 - 05:44:21]
what we can do is if we go ahead and

[05:44:20 - 05:44:25]
make a new file here I'm going to call

[05:44:21 - 05:44:27]
it app. ipynb I'm not sure how I've

[05:44:25 - 05:44:30]
memorized that at this point but that is

[05:44:27 - 05:44:32]
stands for iron Python and this ynb I

[05:44:30 - 05:44:34]
guess kind of for jupyter Notebook oh

[05:44:32 - 05:44:36]
yeah I guess it is yeah so the J is

[05:44:34 - 05:44:38]
represented as or sorry Jupiter is

[05:44:36 - 05:44:39]
represented as a y so iron python

[05:44:38 - 05:44:41]
notebook okay that's the way I'm going

[05:44:39 - 05:44:43]
to remember it from now on I'm going to

[05:44:41 - 05:44:45]
make a new code block here and I'm going

[05:44:43 - 05:44:49]
to do I want to uh require something so

[05:44:45 - 05:44:51]
we'll say python or what is it um

[05:44:49 - 05:44:52]
import. EnV because that's how we're

[05:44:51 - 05:44:54]
going to bring in that there I'll hit

[05:44:52 - 05:44:56]
run and notice right away it pops up

[05:44:54 - 05:44:58]
because right now there's no kernel it

[05:44:56 - 05:45:00]
doesn't know about cond it doesn't even

[05:44:58 - 05:45:02]
know about WSL as if you've installed

[05:45:00 - 05:45:04]
WSL and you don't have um particular

[05:45:02 - 05:45:07]
plugin here it might not work but I'll

[05:45:04 - 05:45:10]
click it here and here I can see python

[05:45:07 - 05:45:12]
312 .3 and I don't want to use that what

[05:45:10 - 05:45:13]
I actually want to use is the minond

[05:45:12 - 05:45:15]
environment this is the same environment

[05:45:13 - 05:45:17]
down here so this one's that's installed

[05:45:15 - 05:45:19]
I know it's recommending it and this is

[05:45:17 - 05:45:21]
the base one but we really want to go to

[05:45:19 - 05:45:23]
Hello and this might just work

[05:45:21 - 05:45:25]
surprisingly I'm surprised that just

[05:45:23 - 05:45:26]
works so sometimes what you need to do

[05:45:25 - 05:45:28]
is install a couple things and maybe

[05:45:26 - 05:45:31]
they're already installed here so I

[05:45:28 - 05:45:32]
already have WL installed okay another

[05:45:31 - 05:45:33]
thing that you might need installed here

[05:45:32 - 05:45:37]
if this is not working for you is remote

[05:45:33 - 05:45:40]
desktop remote developer

[05:45:37 - 05:45:42]
uh remote Explorer remote like I would I

[05:45:40 - 05:45:43]
would install this one like I have WSL

[05:45:42 - 05:45:46]
installed so it's working fine but this

[05:45:43 - 05:45:49]
one is super super useful in fact um I'm

[05:45:46 - 05:45:52]
right now remote I remoted into this

[05:45:49 - 05:45:55]
machine using remote desktop but I could

[05:45:52 - 05:45:58]
uh connect to this machine through this

[05:45:55 - 05:46:00]
plugin and then not have to work through

[05:45:58 - 05:46:01]
this here but I don't have that set up

[05:46:00 - 05:46:04]
here today I'm not I'm not planning to

[05:46:01 - 05:46:06]
show show that here so um that's that

[05:46:04 - 05:46:08]
but anyway there's that and then there's

[05:46:06 - 05:46:11]
also Jupiter so I think here if I go

[05:46:08 - 05:46:13]
here I want to see what extensions I

[05:46:11 - 05:46:15]
have installed show running

[05:46:13 - 05:46:17]
extensions and so there's one called

[05:46:15 - 05:46:18]
Jupiter as well that you'll need but

[05:46:17 - 05:46:20]
anyway when you click this it normally

[05:46:18 - 05:46:22]
will ask you to install them and you

[05:46:20 - 05:46:24]
just say yes but if you don't you know

[05:46:22 - 05:46:27]
we'll just type them

[05:46:24 - 05:46:30]
in

[05:46:27 - 05:46:31]
Jupiter

[05:46:30 - 05:46:34]
here

[05:46:31 - 05:46:35]
jiter you got to type it right and so

[05:46:34 - 05:46:37]
you can see I already have this

[05:46:35 - 05:46:39]
installed and it might have installed a

[05:46:37 - 05:46:41]
few other ones as well so just let it

[05:46:39 - 05:46:43]
install whatever it wants to install but

[05:46:41 - 05:46:46]
the idea is over here is we have our

[05:46:43 - 05:46:47]
kernel and it picked it out from here

[05:46:46 - 05:46:50]
but normally you're supposed to create

[05:46:47 - 05:46:51]
an IP kernel um within it which we'll

[05:46:50 - 05:46:53]
show in the next video but all I want to

[05:46:51 - 05:46:56]
show you is that this is connected to

[05:46:53 - 05:46:57]
cond and so we have EnV and so what I

[05:46:56 - 05:46:59]
want to do is I want to make a new file

[05:46:57 - 05:47:01]
called

[05:46:59 - 05:47:03]
EnV and in here I'm just going to make

[05:47:01 - 05:47:04]
uh something called it doesn't really

[05:47:03 - 05:47:07]
matter what it is it's going to be like

[05:47:04 - 05:47:09]
hello world this is a we basically

[05:47:07 - 05:47:11]
environment variable here okay and we'll

[05:47:09 - 05:47:13]
go back over to

[05:47:11 - 05:47:16]
here and so I have

[05:47:13 - 05:47:18]
EnV um and I think it's

[05:47:16 - 05:47:21]
EnV

[05:47:18 - 05:47:24]
load EnV and so what that will do is it

[05:47:21 - 05:47:25]
will load it I usually always have my

[05:47:24 - 05:47:28]
Imports on a separate line

[05:47:25 - 05:47:32]
here okay so we run this

[05:47:28 - 05:47:33]
one running cells requires IP kernel

[05:47:32 - 05:47:35]
package okay so that's something that we

[05:47:33 - 05:47:38]
don't have installed and so I was

[05:47:35 - 05:47:41]
thinking that yeah I was thinking that

[05:47:38 - 05:47:42]
uh we wouldn't need this till we um we

[05:47:41 - 05:47:44]
did the next one but IP kernel won't

[05:47:42 - 05:47:46]
work unless you have this installed so

[05:47:44 - 05:47:47]
it looks like we do need to have it it's

[05:47:46 - 05:47:49]
doing like update dependencies Force

[05:47:47 - 05:47:51]
reinstall I don't know if we have to do

[05:47:49 - 05:47:53]
all of that and I would probably write

[05:47:51 - 05:47:55]
this a little bit differently so I'm

[05:47:53 - 05:47:56]
going to go back over to here and so I

[05:47:55 - 05:47:58]
thought this would be for the next video

[05:47:56 - 05:48:02]
but it's for this one and so if we want

[05:47:58 - 05:48:05]
to um go over to here as this is a

[05:48:02 - 05:48:07]
separate video we'll go here and say new

[05:48:05 - 05:48:08]
folder this is um

[05:48:07 - 05:48:10]
vs

[05:48:08 - 05:48:16]
code

[05:48:10 - 05:48:22]
um notebook. MD so what we need to

[05:48:16 - 05:48:24]
do oh I always make it a a folder I

[05:48:22 - 05:48:28]
promise you I'm a really good coder if

[05:48:24 - 05:48:31]
you saw me in uh um uh macvim you'd be

[05:48:28 - 05:48:34]
like wow Andrew you're really

[05:48:31 - 05:48:37]
good but I'm working in this editor here

[05:48:34 - 05:48:41]
so I would probably do cond

[05:48:37 - 05:48:43]
um install hyphy cond Forge like the

[05:48:41 - 05:48:45]
other one will will work but this is

[05:48:43 - 05:48:46]
probably better IP kernel okay so this

[05:48:45 - 05:48:49]
is the way that we can actually create

[05:48:46 - 05:48:51]
our own kernels ipy

[05:48:49 - 05:48:54]
kernel and so I'm going to go ahead and

[05:48:51 - 05:48:54]
copy this

[05:48:55 - 05:49:01]
here I'm probably G just have to write

[05:48:57 - 05:49:04]
it again yep and so say cond make sure

[05:49:01 - 05:49:08]
again you are in the correct environment

[05:49:04 - 05:49:09]
cond install hyphen C cond Forge

[05:49:08 - 05:49:12]
ipy

[05:49:09 - 05:49:15]
kernel we'll hit enter and so that is

[05:49:12 - 05:49:16]
now installing ipy kernel I kind of feel

[05:49:15 - 05:49:18]
like after you do that you usually have

[05:49:16 - 05:49:19]
to do something else but maybe not so

[05:49:18 - 05:49:21]
let's go ahead and give this a go let's

[05:49:19 - 05:49:23]
try this

[05:49:21 - 05:49:25]
again and it's complaining so I'm going

[05:49:23 - 05:49:27]
to go ahead here

[05:49:25 - 05:49:29]
and I'm going close this out here for a

[05:49:27 - 05:49:33]
second don't save we'll go back into

[05:49:29 - 05:49:34]
this let's run it again no it's still

[05:49:33 - 05:49:36]
complaining so let's go take a look up

[05:49:34 - 05:49:40]
at ipy kernel I always feel like there's

[05:49:36 - 05:49:40]
some after it that I forget ipy

[05:49:41 - 05:49:45]
kernel okay I'm just doing this on my

[05:49:42 - 05:49:45]
other machine

[05:49:47 - 05:49:50]
[Music]

[05:49:53 - 05:49:59]
here so we have Pip

[05:49:56 - 05:50:02]
install python hyphen M ipy

[05:49:59 - 05:50:02]
[Music]

[05:50:02 - 05:50:09]
kernel conduit create new environment

[05:50:07 - 05:50:10]
see probably would have been easier if

[05:50:09 - 05:50:12]
we created this environment that way so

[05:50:10 - 05:50:14]
what I'm going to

[05:50:12 - 05:50:16]
do because probably we could have like

[05:50:14 - 05:50:17]
restarted and did what it asked us to do

[05:50:16 - 05:50:19]
but it might be just easier to just

[05:50:17 - 05:50:21]
delete this environment start over so

[05:50:19 - 05:50:24]
what we're going to do is we're going to

[05:50:21 - 05:50:26]
say um cond

[05:50:24 - 05:50:29]
deactivate then we're going to do

[05:50:26 - 05:50:29]
cond

[05:50:30 - 05:50:37]
um remove hyphen n

[05:50:34 - 05:50:39]
hello uh hyphen hyphen all

[05:50:37 - 05:50:40]
y then after that we're going to

[05:50:39 - 05:50:45]
recreate the environment so conduit

[05:50:40 - 05:50:48]
create hyphen n hello python

[05:50:45 - 05:50:51]
310 zero but we want to bring

[05:50:48 - 05:50:52]
in uh ipy kernel in that stage and

[05:50:51 - 05:50:54]
that'll just make our lives a lot easier

[05:50:52 - 05:50:57]
if we always remember to do that so let

[05:50:54 - 05:50:59]
me just go

[05:50:57 - 05:51:03]
find that folder

[05:50:59 - 05:51:03]
here and so here it just says ipy

[05:51:04 - 05:51:09]
kernel but then over here it's saying

[05:51:07 - 05:51:11]
hyphen M install user so I wonder if we

[05:51:09 - 05:51:13]
still have to do

[05:51:11 - 05:51:16]
that

[05:51:13 - 05:51:17]
okay so maybe we just had to run this

[05:51:16 - 05:51:20]
line here and we don't have to actually

[05:51:17 - 05:51:21]
uninstall we didn't uninstall yet have

[05:51:20 - 05:51:24]
we no okay so let me just try to run

[05:51:21 - 05:51:24]
this single line

[05:51:27 - 05:51:32]
here what it does I do not remember so

[05:51:30 - 05:51:35]
say no kernel exists so okay that's fine

[05:51:32 - 05:51:39]
so what we'll do is we'll take this line

[05:51:35 - 05:51:39]
here we'll breing get into our

[05:51:41 - 05:51:44]
instructions and the other thing I want

[05:51:43 - 05:51:46]
here

[05:51:44 - 05:51:49]
is sorry I got a little thing moving on

[05:51:46 - 05:51:51]
my desk here um

[05:51:49 - 05:51:53]
IP y

[05:51:51 - 05:51:56]
kernel

[05:51:53 - 05:51:57]
right so now we'll go through and uh run

[05:51:56 - 05:51:59]
through all this so the first thing is I

[05:51:57 - 05:51:59]
want to do cond

[05:52:02 - 05:52:09]
deactivate cond to remove hyphen and

[05:52:05 - 05:52:11]
hello hyph uh hyphen hyphen all hyphen y

[05:52:09 - 05:52:12]
so that's going to remove that

[05:52:11 - 05:52:15]
environment we're going to recreate from

[05:52:12 - 05:52:19]
scratch hyphen n

[05:52:15 - 05:52:19]
hello we said python equals

[05:52:20 - 05:52:24]
3.10.1 kernel and I think like when you

[05:52:23 - 05:52:25]
just put anything after that it's just

[05:52:24 - 05:52:27]
going to install that so we could

[05:52:25 - 05:52:28]
actually put more packages here if we

[05:52:27 - 05:52:30]
wanted to like if I want a torch I could

[05:52:28 - 05:52:33]
probably put it there but I'm just going

[05:52:30 - 05:52:35]
to do ipy kernel here today and then I'm

[05:52:33 - 05:52:37]
just going to do a pip list to see

[05:52:35 - 05:52:40]
what's installed oh well sorry we got to

[05:52:37 - 05:52:46]
activate so we could do cond

[05:52:40 - 05:52:46]
activate um cond activate uh

[05:52:49 - 05:52:53]
hello we created that environment

[05:52:54 - 05:52:58]
right okay so it's saying that package

[05:52:56 - 05:52:59]
doesn't exist did we type it wrong maybe

[05:52:58 - 05:53:02]
we typed it

[05:52:59 - 05:53:04]
wrong iy

[05:53:02 - 05:53:09]
kernel I mean it looks right to me let

[05:53:04 - 05:53:09]
me double check I py

[05:53:13 - 05:53:20]
kernel yeah so like this one here

[05:53:16 - 05:53:20]
says ipy kernel

[05:53:20 - 05:53:24]
here Source activate my environment and

[05:53:23 - 05:53:27]
then do ipy

[05:53:24 - 05:53:29]
kernel for example using con environment

[05:53:27 - 05:53:33]
install my python kernel in a first

[05:53:29 - 05:53:33]
environment so python hyphen

[05:53:33 - 05:53:38]
M yeah so I mean like that's what we did

[05:53:36 - 05:53:41]
more or

[05:53:38 - 05:53:42]
less well sometimes I'm just making

[05:53:41 - 05:53:45]
these things from scratch we'll we have

[05:53:42 - 05:53:46]
less of an issue so I'm just going to do

[05:53:45 - 05:53:48]
three Z I could have swore we could have

[05:53:46 - 05:53:49]
done it on a single line there but maybe

[05:53:48 - 05:53:52]
we had to do like hyeny condo Forge I've

[05:53:49 - 05:53:53]
definitely done that before on a single

[05:53:52 - 05:53:55]
line but that's totally fine if that

[05:53:53 - 05:53:57]
doesn't want to work here today and

[05:53:55 - 05:53:57]
we'll do hyphen

[05:53:59 - 05:54:07]
Y and I'm going to try this again so

[05:54:01 - 05:54:07]
it's cond install uh ipy kernel

[05:54:08 - 05:54:12]
I think that if you don't um specify

[05:54:11 - 05:54:16]
cond cond of Forge it will still pull

[05:54:12 - 05:54:17]
from there oh we didn't activate the the

[05:54:16 - 05:54:21]
the one that's that's something it's

[05:54:17 - 05:54:26]
very easy to forget to do that to do

[05:54:21 - 05:54:26]
um cond install ipy

[05:54:29 - 05:54:37]
kernel okay so didn't find it see that's

[05:54:33 - 05:54:37]
why I think you need cond Forge

[05:54:40 - 05:54:45]
okay so it's still not finding

[05:54:42 - 05:54:49]
it so maybe we never installed it this

[05:54:45 - 05:54:51]
entire time ipy kernel am I crazy do I

[05:54:49 - 05:54:55]
not know how to install

[05:54:51 - 05:54:57]
that ipy kernel am I spelling it wrong

[05:54:55 - 05:54:59]
am I putting an A in

[05:54:57 - 05:55:01]
there yeah I am that's probably why it

[05:54:59 - 05:55:02]
hasn't been working this entire time so

[05:55:01 - 05:55:04]
maybe maybe that was my big problem I

[05:55:02 - 05:55:05]
just was typing it wrong and you're like

[05:55:04 - 05:55:07]
Andrew you're

[05:55:05 - 05:55:09]
crazy and I bet it would have worked as

[05:55:07 - 05:55:12]
a single line as well so we could

[05:55:09 - 05:55:14]
probably go back to this uh so we'd have

[05:55:12 - 05:55:14]
um cond to

[05:55:14 - 05:55:20]
activate so now it makes me think that

[05:55:16 - 05:55:23]
this could have always been um ipy

[05:55:20 - 05:55:26]
kernel like

[05:55:23 - 05:55:29]
that uh so I'm going to type in PIP show

[05:55:26 - 05:55:29]
or sorry pip

[05:55:30 - 05:55:34]
list okay so I'm going to go and I know

[05:55:33 - 05:55:36]
this is tedious but I'm going to go

[05:55:34 - 05:55:39]
ahead I'm going to deactivate it

[05:55:36 - 05:55:40]
because I want to know um okay that's

[05:55:39 - 05:55:43]
great defender thank you I want to know

[05:55:40 - 05:55:46]
definitively that it can do it so goonda

[05:55:43 - 05:55:48]
remove hyphen n hello hyphen hyphen all

[05:55:46 - 05:55:50]
hyphen y it's going to remove everything

[05:55:48 - 05:55:53]
we'll try this again cond create hyphen

[05:55:50 - 05:55:56]
n hello python

[05:55:53 - 05:56:00]
310 python equals

[05:55:56 - 05:56:00]
310 Z ipy

[05:56:00 - 05:56:06]
kernel hyphen Y and let's see if that

[05:56:03 - 05:56:06]
works

[05:56:08 - 05:56:13]
okay and so now what I want to do is do

[05:56:10 - 05:56:16]
cona activate

[05:56:13 - 05:56:21]
hello and we'll do cond or sorry pip

[05:56:16 - 05:56:23]
list do we have ipy kernel we do okay so

[05:56:21 - 05:56:25]
the question is do we have to run this

[05:56:23 - 05:56:28]
weird line which I don't know what it

[05:56:25 - 05:56:29]
does I don't know what hyphen m is um it

[05:56:28 - 05:56:32]
looks like it's installing it for the

[05:56:29 - 05:56:34]
user but let's go ahead and see what

[05:56:32 - 05:56:37]
happens so I'm going to go ahead and

[05:56:34 - 05:56:39]
save this file up here

[05:56:37 - 05:56:40]
and I'm try to bring this down here I

[05:56:39 - 05:56:43]
want to select a

[05:56:40 - 05:56:45]
kernel so now it should be kernel

[05:56:43 - 05:56:47]
compatible like we have the kernel

[05:56:45 - 05:56:49]
created so it doesn't even show it here

[05:56:47 - 05:56:49]
I'm going to give this a

[05:56:56 - 05:56:59]
refresh yeah so it's not showing it one

[05:56:58 - 05:57:01]
second here this could be a little bit

[05:56:59 - 05:57:02]
finicky I don't trust it so I'm going to

[05:57:01 - 05:57:06]
close it out I'm going to reopen it in

[05:57:02 - 05:57:06]
vs code

[05:57:10 - 05:57:14]
and I'm going to first switch

[05:57:13 - 05:57:16]
over well we don't really need to switch

[05:57:14 - 05:57:20]
over right now but we'll switch over

[05:57:16 - 05:57:25]
we'll say um cond to activate

[05:57:20 - 05:57:28]
hello and I'm going to go back up to

[05:57:25 - 05:57:31]
here hit run it's just going to complain

[05:57:28 - 05:57:31]
because we don't have an environment

[05:57:32 - 05:57:36]
selected I want to select a different

[05:57:34 - 05:57:38]
one

[05:57:36 - 05:57:39]
python environment there we go so isn't

[05:57:38 - 05:57:41]
it interesting that I just like

[05:57:39 - 05:57:42]
restarted now it's okay I like how this

[05:57:41 - 05:57:44]
indicates that it's a cond environment

[05:57:42 - 05:57:46]
this one's not but it is okay so now

[05:57:44 - 05:57:49]
we're using

[05:57:46 - 05:57:52]
310 and I mean we don't have that module

[05:57:49 - 05:57:54]
installed right so that kind of makes

[05:57:52 - 05:57:55]
sense so it's not necessarily that it's

[05:57:54 - 05:57:57]
not working it's just that we don't have

[05:57:55 - 05:57:59]
it installed so you know again we can

[05:57:57 - 05:58:01]
install this way using this one uh

[05:57:59 - 05:58:03]
another way that we could install it is

[05:58:01 - 05:58:04]
we could also just add it as a line of

[05:58:03 - 05:58:06]
code so you could do the you could do

[05:58:04 - 05:58:07]
the PIP requirements.txt if you want

[05:58:06 - 05:58:09]
that there but I wanted to show this

[05:58:07 - 05:58:11]
anyway so we have Pip

[05:58:09 - 05:58:14]
install

[05:58:11 - 05:58:18]
umv or python.

[05:58:14 - 05:58:19]
EnV okay so we can do that here so that

[05:58:18 - 05:58:21]
will install it here sometimes I like to

[05:58:19 - 05:58:22]
silence it so I'll do a hyphen Q on that

[05:58:21 - 05:58:25]
and I'll make it a little bit cleaner

[05:58:22 - 05:58:28]
you can also do like uh interjection but

[05:58:25 - 05:58:29]
um I do percentage and maybe I do it

[05:58:28 - 05:58:31]
wrong sometimes it tells you to restart

[05:58:29 - 05:58:33]
the environment when you do that but

[05:58:31 - 05:58:35]
it's probably fine in this case so now

[05:58:33 - 05:58:37]
there's no problem then we run this one

[05:58:35 - 05:58:39]
which is good and then uh we'll need to

[05:58:37 - 05:58:42]
import OS so I'll do it over here import

[05:58:39 - 05:58:44]
OS and I'll save it here and so what I

[05:58:42 - 05:58:46]
want to do is print out uh the

[05:58:44 - 05:58:48]
environment so say OS

[05:58:46 - 05:58:50]
Environ and which is for environment and

[05:58:48 - 05:58:54]
this will be for hello and then we'll go

[05:58:50 - 05:58:56]
ahead and print that and it says Environ

[05:58:54 - 05:58:59]
object is not callable maybe it's Square

[05:58:56 - 05:59:03]
braces I don't know thought it was

[05:58:59 - 05:59:06]
that unless there's like a DOT after it

[05:59:03 - 05:59:06]
Environ

[05:59:07 - 05:59:12]
dot get

[05:59:09 - 05:59:13]
maybe this is not my uh primary language

[05:59:12 - 05:59:16]
so I'm always kind of guessing there we

[05:59:13 - 05:59:18]
go and so we have it so yeah it looks

[05:59:16 - 05:59:21]
like we don't need this third line here

[05:59:18 - 05:59:21]
but I have seen it

[05:59:21 - 05:59:26]
before right and that makes it so that

[05:59:25 - 05:59:27]
it shows up as an ipy kernel if you

[05:59:26 - 05:59:29]
don't install this I thought we're going

[05:59:27 - 05:59:31]
to do this in the next video but um

[05:59:29 - 05:59:33]
sometimes it work sometimes it doesn't

[05:59:31 - 05:59:34]
um but this is the proper way to do it

[05:59:33 - 05:59:36]
now that I have it here this totally

[05:59:34 - 05:59:38]
makes sense uh so hopefully that wasn't

[05:59:36 - 05:59:40]
too confusing but often you are you are

[05:59:38 - 05:59:42]
fiddling with this and I could be on

[05:59:40 - 05:59:44]
like 10 different machines and have 10

[05:59:42 - 05:59:45]
different problems even though we're

[05:59:44 - 05:59:46]
following the same in instructions so

[05:59:45 - 05:59:49]
don't get discouraged if this doesn't

[05:59:46 - 05:59:50]
work perfectly for you um but if you're

[05:59:49 - 05:59:52]
going to want to do local development is

[05:59:50 - 05:59:53]
a little bit of a challenge okay so in

[05:59:52 - 05:59:56]
the next video what I want to show you

[05:59:53 - 05:59:58]
is installing Jupiter lab server as this

[05:59:56 - 06:00:00]
is fine but you might also want a

[05:59:58 - 06:00:02]
jupyter lab server as it's just a

[06:00:00 - 06:00:04]
different experience okay so I'm going

[06:00:02 - 06:00:06]
to stop the video here I'm leaving

[06:00:04 - 06:00:07]
everything as it is and I'll see you you

[06:00:06 - 06:00:11]
in the next one okay

[06:00:07 - 06:00:13]
[Music]

[06:00:11 - 06:00:16]
ciao all right so we're going to pick up

[06:00:13 - 06:00:17]
uh where we last left off um so we got

[06:00:16 - 06:00:19]
this working here but another way we

[06:00:17 - 06:00:22]
might want to work with this is with

[06:00:19 - 06:00:24]
Jupiter Jupiter lab so what I want to do

[06:00:22 - 06:00:26]
is I want to get Jupiter uh lab

[06:00:24 - 06:00:27]
installed and so I'm going to go ahead

[06:00:26 - 06:00:28]
and we're just going to make a new

[06:00:27 - 06:00:30]
document over here so we can kind of

[06:00:28 - 06:00:34]
follow along and so this one's going to

[06:00:30 - 06:00:36]
be Jupiter uh Jupiter server I mean I

[06:00:34 - 06:00:40]
suppose this one could be separate

[06:00:36 - 06:00:43]
uh we'll make a new folder here called

[06:00:40 - 06:00:45]
Jupiter

[06:00:43 - 06:00:49]
Jupiter

[06:00:45 - 06:00:49]
server and I'll make a new read me

[06:00:51 - 06:00:56]
here and I'm going to probably want to

[06:00:53 - 06:00:59]
create a new environment so I'm going to

[06:00:56 - 06:01:00]
go uh yeah it's always good practice for

[06:00:59 - 06:01:02]
us to do this so I'm going to go ahead

[06:01:00 - 06:01:07]
and just delete this one so I'm can say

[06:01:02 - 06:01:10]
deactivate and this will be cond remove

[06:01:07 - 06:01:13]
hyphen n hello hyphen hyphen all hyphen

[06:01:10 - 06:01:15]
yes and so we'll want to make a new one

[06:01:13 - 06:01:18]
here um and let's see if I can do this

[06:01:15 - 06:01:19]
for memory so what we're going to do we

[06:01:18 - 06:01:22]
can still work in the hello folder it's

[06:01:19 - 06:01:24]
totally fine um as this is a very small

[06:01:22 - 06:01:29]
application but

[06:01:24 - 06:01:29]
um what I'm going to want to do here

[06:01:29 - 06:01:33]
is first create an environment so we'll

[06:01:31 - 06:01:37]
say cond to create hyphen n and this one

[06:01:33 - 06:01:41]
will be called uh ser for server and

[06:01:37 - 06:01:41]
we're going to stick with python uh

[06:01:42 - 06:01:49]
3.10.1 ipy kernel so ipy

[06:01:46 - 06:01:50]
kernel and I'm going to do hyphen y so

[06:01:49 - 06:01:52]
that's going to give us a base install

[06:01:50 - 06:01:54]
that's great I think that there's a

[06:01:52 - 06:01:58]
spelling mistake because it did complain

[06:01:54 - 06:01:59]
I have this habit of making a nstead n l

[06:01:58 - 06:02:01]
so that's my fault so that's going to

[06:01:59 - 06:02:05]
install there now to install Jupiter

[06:02:01 - 06:02:08]
server is really really really simple um

[06:02:05 - 06:02:12]
all we need to do is we need to just say

[06:02:08 - 06:02:12]
cond install hyphen C cond

[06:02:13 - 06:02:22]
Forge cond Forge uh cond Forge

[06:02:20 - 06:02:24]
Jupiter lab and again you probably don't

[06:02:22 - 06:02:26]
have to put hyeny cond of Forge I just

[06:02:24 - 06:02:27]
do that out of habit it's it's just

[06:02:26 - 06:02:29]
telling where to explicitly pull it and

[06:02:27 - 06:02:31]
so that's going to install it for us so

[06:02:29 - 06:02:35]
let's go over here and I'm just going to

[06:02:31 - 06:02:39]
say yes so what were what what steps did

[06:02:35 - 06:02:42]
we just do we did cond create hyphen n

[06:02:39 - 06:02:42]
serve

[06:02:43 - 06:02:52]
um Python 3 310

[06:02:47 - 06:02:54]
0 uh ipy kernel hyphen Y and then we're

[06:02:52 - 06:02:58]
doing cond to create or cond to

[06:02:54 - 06:03:01]
install hyphen C cond to forge

[06:02:58 - 06:03:06]
uh

[06:03:01 - 06:03:06]
Jupiter lab was that it

[06:03:06 - 06:03:13]
Jupiter lab that's right okay so that's

[06:03:10 - 06:03:15]
going to install Jupiter lab but now we

[06:03:13 - 06:03:18]
need to start it so the way we started

[06:03:15 - 06:03:19]
was just type in Jupiter lab hyphen

[06:03:18 - 06:03:22]
hyphen no

[06:03:19 - 06:03:23]
browser um I mean yeah we don't have to

[06:03:22 - 06:03:24]
you could you could say browser if you

[06:03:23 - 06:03:26]
wanted to but this is just the way we

[06:03:24 - 06:03:29]
have it allow root and we're doing we're

[06:03:26 - 06:03:32]
binding on 0000000000 that way that we

[06:03:29 - 06:03:35]
can access it from anywhere so 0000

[06:03:32 - 06:03:37]
we're hit enter and um I spelled allow

[06:03:35 - 06:03:39]
root wrong if you spell things wrong it

[06:03:37 - 06:03:40]
won't work so go ahead and hit enter

[06:03:39 - 06:03:42]
here and so now it's starting on Port

[06:03:40 - 06:03:45]
888 I'm going to open the browser and so

[06:03:42 - 06:03:48]
here is our initial server it wants us

[06:03:45 - 06:03:51]
to um authenticate and so what we'll

[06:03:48 - 06:03:53]
need to do is set up a password or token

[06:03:51 - 06:03:55]
um so it's up to you I mean if you're

[06:03:53 - 06:03:57]
using this often I bring the token in

[06:03:55 - 06:03:59]
here and set your own password so I'm

[06:03:57 - 06:04:03]
going to go over to here and so we have

[06:03:59 - 06:04:03]
here this token

[06:04:04 - 06:04:10]
here okay so I'm copying that

[06:04:07 - 06:04:12]
and I'm going to go back over to here

[06:04:10 - 06:04:14]
and so I'm pasting the token in

[06:04:12 - 06:04:15]
here a lot of folks had a lot of trouble

[06:04:14 - 06:04:17]
pasting this token here so you could do

[06:04:15 - 06:04:19]
one over here and never have to do it

[06:04:17 - 06:04:21]
again or you can set a password I don't

[06:04:19 - 06:04:23]
know I'm going to put it up here it's up

[06:04:21 - 06:04:24]
to you what you want to do I mean worst

[06:04:23 - 06:04:26]
case you can tear it down and reset it

[06:04:24 - 06:04:27]
up so now we have our python environment

[06:04:26 - 06:04:30]
so we'll work in here and we have our

[06:04:27 - 06:04:31]
existing notebook so if we go here you

[06:04:30 - 06:04:33]
can see we can run it and so now we have

[06:04:31 - 06:04:34]
it set up there are some things that we

[06:04:33 - 06:04:36]
don't have here and so there are

[06:04:34 - 06:04:38]
extensions that you might want to

[06:04:36 - 06:04:40]
install for Jupiter lab um that we might

[06:04:38 - 06:04:42]
want to install so let's go ahead and

[06:04:40 - 06:04:45]
just see if there's fun ones we can find

[06:04:42 - 06:04:48]
so Jupiter lab

[06:04:45 - 06:04:51]
Jupiter lab popular extensions install

[06:04:48 - 06:04:53]
condo let's see what we

[06:04:51 - 06:04:56]
have I know like one that I always want

[06:04:53 - 06:04:59]
to install is

[06:04:56 - 06:05:01]
um is the the GitHub one or the git

[06:04:59 - 06:05:03]
Source

[06:05:01 - 06:05:05]
One so that'd be interesting if we go

[06:05:03 - 06:05:07]
here on the left hand side

[06:05:05 - 06:05:08]
is excited to have a robust system we'll

[06:05:07 - 06:05:13]
say

[06:05:08 - 06:05:13]
yes and so these can be installed via

[06:05:13 - 06:05:18]
cond but here we might want to have one

[06:05:15 - 06:05:20]
like the

[06:05:18 - 06:05:22]
git so I'm not sure what that one's

[06:05:20 - 06:05:23]
called git lab Jupiter lab gets so this

[06:05:22 - 06:05:25]
is something we can do we can go back

[06:05:23 - 06:05:28]
over to here I'm going to leave this

[06:05:25 - 06:05:31]
running I don't want to kill it so I'm

[06:05:28 - 06:05:33]
going to open up another

[06:05:31 - 06:05:36]
terminal

[06:05:33 - 06:05:38]
here and we are we're in base right now

[06:05:36 - 06:05:41]
so I'm going to do cond activate hello

[06:05:38 - 06:05:45]
did I install all this in

[06:05:41 - 06:05:47]
base what am I running here is this

[06:05:45 - 06:05:48]
base yeah I want to stop the server for

[06:05:47 - 06:05:50]
a second oh we installed everything in

[06:05:48 - 06:05:52]
the base remember I said you want to

[06:05:50 - 06:05:55]
activate it it happens sometimes so I

[06:05:52 - 06:05:56]
guess I forgot to um activate it that's

[06:05:55 - 06:05:58]
totally fine we'll take a look at how to

[06:05:56 - 06:06:00]
set a reset base here in a moment but we

[06:05:58 - 06:06:02]
are working in base and we really

[06:06:00 - 06:06:03]
shouldn't be and so that's starting back

[06:06:02 - 06:06:04]
up on Port 888 but let's say we want to

[06:06:03 - 06:06:07]
install it and we'll just install in the

[06:06:04 - 06:06:12]
wrong place so we can do um what is it J

[06:06:07 - 06:06:14]
or cond hyphen C cond Forge install oh

[06:06:12 - 06:06:19]
sorry it's installs on this side here

[06:06:14 - 06:06:22]
install and this will be uh Jupiter

[06:06:19 - 06:06:24]
lab git okay so I think they're the same

[06:06:22 - 06:06:28]
name as the extensions to install them

[06:06:24 - 06:06:29]
hyphen y or just y there and if we go

[06:06:28 - 06:06:30]
back over to here I'm not sure if we

[06:06:29 - 06:06:32]
have to restart the server for this to

[06:06:30 - 06:06:36]
take effect so I give this a hard

[06:06:32 - 06:06:38]
refresh here so we still don't it cuz we

[06:06:36 - 06:06:39]
don't have any way of it did pop up and

[06:06:38 - 06:06:41]
complained there a second ago if go that

[06:06:39 - 06:06:44]
refresh what what was

[06:06:41 - 06:06:45]
wrong get extension unavailable please

[06:06:44 - 06:06:49]
ensure you have installed the jupyter

[06:06:45 - 06:06:52]
lab git server extension installing pip

[06:06:49 - 06:06:53]
install upgrade jupyter lab git to

[06:06:52 - 06:06:55]
confirm the server extension is

[06:06:53 - 06:06:56]
installed run Jupiter's server extension

[06:06:55 - 06:06:57]
list so I'm not sure what it's

[06:06:56 - 06:06:58]
complaining about there but what I'm

[06:06:57 - 06:07:01]
going to

[06:06:58 - 06:07:03]
do so I don't trust I don't trust its

[06:07:01 - 06:07:06]
complaints I'm going to go back over to

[06:07:03 - 06:07:08]
here

[06:07:06 - 06:07:10]
whoops and I'm going to do the uh the

[06:07:08 - 06:07:11]
old trick of stopping and starting it

[06:07:10 - 06:07:13]
again so we're going to stop it and

[06:07:11 - 06:07:15]
start it

[06:07:13 - 06:07:16]
again because it didn't know about that

[06:07:15 - 06:07:19]
extension prior to here and we'll give

[06:07:16 - 06:07:21]
this a refresh so now it shows up okay

[06:07:19 - 06:07:23]
so that's one way we can install

[06:07:21 - 06:07:25]
extensions I think that we can install

[06:07:23 - 06:07:26]
them here on the left hand side but

[06:07:25 - 06:07:28]
sometimes your environment does not

[06:07:26 - 06:07:30]
allow you to do that so sometimes you

[06:07:28 - 06:07:31]
have to do it through cond but maybe

[06:07:30 - 06:07:35]
there's something else that we would

[06:07:31 - 06:07:35]
like to install

[06:07:36 - 06:07:40]
[Music]

[06:07:37 - 06:07:43]
uh pastel colors that sounds like

[06:07:40 - 06:07:44]
fun so if I want to install this I we

[06:07:43 - 06:07:46]
click the little install button here and

[06:07:44 - 06:07:49]
will it install for

[06:07:46 - 06:07:52]
us so you need to refresh the

[06:07:49 - 06:07:55]
page nice hard refresh

[06:07:52 - 06:07:57]
here

[06:07:55 - 06:08:00]
and I don't know I mean it's installed

[06:07:57 - 06:08:01]
but it doesn't feel like it's here so I

[06:08:00 - 06:08:04]
don't trust it so I'm going to go ahead

[06:08:01 - 06:08:07]
and close it out and I'm going to reopen

[06:08:04 - 06:08:09]
it again so we'll say local host

[06:08:07 - 06:08:12]
8888 see what we get

[06:08:09 - 06:08:14]
here I still don't see our pastel colors

[06:08:12 - 06:08:16]
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

[06:08:14 - 06:08:19]
again do the the usual trick Stop the

[06:08:16 - 06:08:22]
server restart it up go back over to

[06:08:19 - 06:08:22]
here I mean it says it's

[06:08:23 - 06:08:28]
installed why why don't I see

[06:08:25 - 06:08:31]
it so go down here yeah like wow that

[06:08:28 - 06:08:35]
looks so much nicer so it says install

[06:08:31 - 06:08:35]
the juper lab extension pipond

[06:08:36 - 06:08:41]
okay so I mean it didn't work that way

[06:08:38 - 06:08:43]
and so I again I don't really trust the

[06:08:41 - 06:08:44]
extensions installed this way I feel

[06:08:43 - 06:08:47]
like if you want something installed you

[06:08:44 - 06:08:50]
have to really do it this

[06:08:47 - 06:08:50]
way so do

[06:08:50 - 06:08:53]
that say

[06:08:55 - 06:09:03]
yes I'll restart the server

[06:08:58 - 06:09:03]
here and we'll give this a nice refresh

[06:09:03 - 06:09:08]
here okay I mean it's definitely

[06:09:06 - 06:09:10]
installed okay so we say install the

[06:09:08 - 06:09:12]
jupyter lab extension we did that it's

[06:09:10 - 06:09:14]
definitely installed start and restart

[06:09:12 - 06:09:17]
Jupiter if it's already open reset the

[06:09:14 - 06:09:19]
application go to settings oh okay so

[06:09:17 - 06:09:20]
it's not that it's not installed we just

[06:09:19 - 06:09:22]
had to go over here to do it oh cool we

[06:09:20 - 06:09:25]
have all these

[06:09:22 - 06:09:27]
themes well look at

[06:09:25 - 06:09:29]
that

[06:09:27 - 06:09:31]
okay I think these are all the ones we

[06:09:29 - 06:09:34]
installed was the uh these ones here

[06:09:31 - 06:09:36]
that one's pretty nice um so yeah maybe

[06:09:34 - 06:09:38]
maybe the Z work here on left hand side

[06:09:36 - 06:09:40]
and I just was kind of

[06:09:38 - 06:09:41]
ignorant uh what other kind of

[06:09:40 - 06:09:43]
extensions could we go here let's just

[06:09:41 - 06:09:45]
see if there's another

[06:09:43 - 06:09:48]
one there's another like cat one I'm not

[06:09:45 - 06:09:51]
a huge fan of cats but uh sorry cat

[06:09:48 - 06:09:53]
folks but maybe there's another one here

[06:09:51 - 06:09:53]
that was like cat

[06:09:54 - 06:10:00]
[Music]

[06:09:57 - 06:10:02]
related I'm trying to find one

[06:10:00 - 06:10:05]
that like we'll be able to notice right

[06:10:02 - 06:10:07]
away if we were to use it let's go up to

[06:10:05 - 06:10:09]
here and just say like Ruby can we get

[06:10:07 - 06:10:09]
ruby in

[06:10:10 - 06:10:16]
here no just type in

[06:10:14 - 06:10:18]
cat I guess that's only for ones that

[06:10:16 - 06:10:20]
are oh yeah it is it is searching down

[06:10:18 - 06:10:22]
below it's just updating the list so

[06:10:20 - 06:10:23]
what I typed it here there we go now I'm

[06:10:22 - 06:10:25]
starting to see

[06:10:23 - 06:10:27]
one what's

[06:10:25 - 06:10:29]
this has no page well I don't think I

[06:10:27 - 06:10:32]
trust ones if I can't find

[06:10:29 - 06:10:35]
them can we type game in here like do we

[06:10:32 - 06:10:38]
get a is there like a game nope can we

[06:10:35 - 06:10:42]
get Ruby like another

[06:10:38 - 06:10:44]
runtime nope but anyway um again I I

[06:10:42 - 06:10:45]
feel more confident installing it via uh

[06:10:44 - 06:10:48]
via the terminal here and just

[06:10:45 - 06:10:50]
restarting and so um anyway that's

[06:10:48 - 06:10:52]
stuper lab server if you want to do more

[06:10:50 - 06:10:55]
with it there's obviously um more

[06:10:52 - 06:10:57]
configuration that occurs but um this is

[06:10:55 - 06:10:59]
how I have it set up on my machine in

[06:10:57 - 06:11:02]
another user account here and so when I

[06:10:59 - 06:11:05]
want to work um on the Intel AI

[06:11:02 - 06:11:07]
developer kit from my main computer I

[06:11:05 - 06:11:09]
can just connect to the server and it

[06:11:07 - 06:11:11]
runs on a particular port and so if I

[06:11:09 - 06:11:13]
run if I start it up I just go to Local

[06:11:11 - 06:11:15]
Host whatever or the or sorry not Local

[06:11:13 - 06:11:19]
Host but the name of the of the actual

[06:11:15 - 06:11:20]
server and that is good enough for me um

[06:11:19 - 06:11:22]
so yeah we went over here we installed a

[06:11:20 - 06:11:24]
couple things so maybe we'll just go

[06:11:22 - 06:11:26]
ahead and uh show those instructions

[06:11:24 - 06:11:28]
here just want to bring those back over

[06:11:26 - 06:11:29]
so we have uh this one here which is how

[06:11:28 - 06:11:33]
to start

[06:11:29 - 06:11:35]
it it's very very hard to copy and paste

[06:11:33 - 06:11:38]
out of here it's very frustrating

[06:11:35 - 06:11:40]
there we go so that's one and we

[06:11:38 - 06:11:43]
installed

[06:11:40 - 06:11:45]
oops the git one here there we go that

[06:11:43 - 06:11:48]
was one that we

[06:11:45 - 06:11:50]
installed and then there was another one

[06:11:48 - 06:11:53]
that we installed

[06:11:50 - 06:11:56]
um which was the themes nothing nothing

[06:11:53 - 06:11:56]
crazy

[06:12:01 - 06:12:06]
though there we go so we'll go ahead and

[06:12:03 - 06:12:06]
Commit This

[06:12:09 - 06:12:14]
all right and so you're pretty much set

[06:12:10 - 06:12:15]
up for local development now so yeah um

[06:12:14 - 06:12:16]
there you go I'll see you in the next

[06:12:15 - 06:12:20]
one

[06:12:16 - 06:12:23]
[Music]

[06:12:20 - 06:12:24]
ciao let's take a look here at zero shot

[06:12:23 - 06:12:26]
prompting this is when the model can

[06:12:24 - 06:12:29]
perform the expected task with no prior

[06:12:26 - 06:12:32]
knowledge or examples provided during

[06:12:29 - 06:12:33]
prompting uh so an example might be that

[06:12:32 - 06:12:36]
you want to classify some text so the

[06:12:33 - 06:12:38]
text here is Andrew is great at teaching

[06:12:36 - 06:12:41]
gen do we classified as neutral negative

[06:12:38 - 06:12:44]
or positive and so the output the next

[06:12:41 - 06:12:46]
thing that the um uh large language

[06:12:44 - 06:12:48]
model would write would be neutral here

[06:12:46 - 06:12:49]
but the idea is that we didn't have to

[06:12:48 - 06:12:52]
provideed examples of what neutral

[06:12:49 - 06:12:54]
negative positive looked like it already

[06:12:52 - 06:12:55]
had that built-in knowledge uh from when

[06:12:54 - 06:12:58]
it was trained to be able to perform

[06:12:55 - 06:13:02]
that task and that's what we call zero

[06:12:58 - 06:13:05]
[Music]

[06:13:02 - 06:13:06]
shot so fuse shot prompting is when the

[06:13:05 - 06:13:08]
model can perform the expected tasks

[06:13:06 - 06:13:10]
with examples provided during prompting

[06:13:08 - 06:13:12]
so imagine you have a series of tweets

[06:13:10 - 06:13:14]
and your model is not capable of doing

[06:13:12 - 06:13:17]
sentiment analysis so you're providing

[06:13:14 - 06:13:18]
examples of what negative and positive

[06:13:17 - 06:13:20]
uh tweets would look like and the idea

[06:13:18 - 06:13:22]
is that it would predict the next one

[06:13:20 - 06:13:24]
based on the prior examples uh we could

[06:13:22 - 06:13:26]
also call this in context learning

[06:13:24 - 06:13:30]
because you're providing in context in

[06:13:26 - 06:13:31]
the prompt message uh the way in context

[06:13:30 - 06:13:36]
learning because you're providing at

[06:13:31 - 06:13:36]
that point in time so there you go

[06:13:37 - 06:13:40]
[Music]

[06:13:38 - 06:13:41]
let's take a look at prompt chaining so

[06:13:40 - 06:13:43]
prompt chaining is where the output of

[06:13:41 - 06:13:46]
one LM prompt is used as the input for

[06:13:43 - 06:13:47]
the next prompt in a sequence uh the

[06:13:46 - 06:13:49]
reason is when the context window of the

[06:13:47 - 06:13:52]
prompt is too small to complete a single

[06:13:49 - 06:13:54]
large or complex Tex task so we break

[06:13:52 - 06:13:56]
the task up into smaller tasks so an

[06:13:54 - 06:13:58]
example would be imagine we have a movie

[06:13:56 - 06:14:00]
that we want to watch or sorry there's a

[06:13:58 - 06:14:03]
movie that we want to watch to learn

[06:14:00 - 06:14:04]
Japanese and so we want to take the

[06:14:03 - 06:14:06]
subtitles file and convert it into

[06:14:04 - 06:14:08]
English Engish uh and then also get

[06:14:06 - 06:14:10]
grammar rules around it and then provide

[06:14:08 - 06:14:12]
it in adjacent Li lines file this is

[06:14:10 - 06:14:14]
actually something that we do in the

[06:14:12 - 06:14:16]
boot camp and I didn't even realize I

[06:14:14 - 06:14:18]
was doing prompt chaining when I did it

[06:14:16 - 06:14:21]
but I tried to give it a very complex uh

[06:14:18 - 06:14:22]
prompt and it just would not do it it

[06:14:21 - 06:14:24]
would just make a lot of mistakes or

[06:14:22 - 06:14:26]
give me bad information and so I had to

[06:14:24 - 06:14:28]
break it up into smaller tasks and so

[06:14:26 - 06:14:32]
the thing I had to do is iterate each

[06:14:28 - 06:14:35]
over each line in the actual um uh

[06:14:32 - 06:14:37]
subtitles file and say Translate each

[06:14:35 - 06:14:40]
line from Japanese English and then I

[06:14:37 - 06:14:42]
would then um ask it to produce a list

[06:14:40 - 06:14:44]
of grammar rules that it found in the

[06:14:42 - 06:14:45]
sentence then I would then ask it to

[06:14:44 - 06:14:47]
explain the grammar Rule and then

[06:14:45 - 06:14:50]
provide five examples then I would

[06:14:47 - 06:14:52]
format the original line uh translator

[06:14:50 - 06:14:54]
line the grammar rule examples into Json

[06:14:52 - 06:14:57]
uh file so again this is just where

[06:14:54 - 06:14:59]
you're breaking up a task because the

[06:14:57 - 06:15:01]
the um LM cannot handle such a large

[06:14:59 - 06:15:05]
task okay

[06:15:01 - 06:15:07]
[Music]

[06:15:05 - 06:15:08]
let's take a look at Chain of Thought So

[06:15:07 - 06:15:10]
Chain of Thought prompting is when you

[06:15:08 - 06:15:11]
tell the model to do step-by-step

[06:15:10 - 06:15:13]
reasoning so it produces a more accurate

[06:15:11 - 06:15:15]
result without chain of thought you'd

[06:15:13 - 06:15:17]
say something like which two prime

[06:15:15 - 06:15:19]
numbers sum to 10 with chain of thought

[06:15:17 - 06:15:21]
you'd say please solve the problem step

[06:15:19 - 06:15:23]
by step first outline your your

[06:15:21 - 06:15:25]
reasoning is clear a logical Chain of

[06:15:23 - 06:15:28]
Thought then provide the final concise

[06:15:25 - 06:15:31]
answer this is not a huge issue for a

[06:15:28 - 06:15:33]
larger modern models but the smaller

[06:15:31 - 06:15:35]
models um sometimes they just don't know

[06:15:33 - 06:15:38]
things unless they talk out loud and

[06:15:35 - 06:15:39]
work through it so uh sometimes you get

[06:15:38 - 06:15:42]
extremely better results by just telling

[06:15:39 - 06:15:45]
it to think out loud and think step by

[06:15:42 - 06:15:46]
step um and so that's all that is really

[06:15:45 - 06:15:49]
happening here

[06:15:46 - 06:15:51]
[Music]

[06:15:49 - 06:15:53]
okay let's take a look at tree of

[06:15:51 - 06:15:55]
thought so tree of thought prompting is

[06:15:53 - 06:15:56]
where the prompt instructs the model to

[06:15:55 - 06:15:58]
explore possible States and transitions

[06:15:56 - 06:16:01]
rather than trying to produce an answer

[06:15:58 - 06:16:03]
immediately in a single Chain of Thought

[06:16:01 - 06:16:05]
basically creating a decision tree and

[06:16:03 - 06:16:06]
we kind of do this in the boot camp with

[06:16:05 - 06:16:09]
um uh another one where it's the

[06:16:06 - 06:16:11]
Japanese language uh uh Japanese

[06:16:09 - 06:16:13]
language construction helper where we

[06:16:11 - 06:16:15]
actually Define States and tell it how

[06:16:13 - 06:16:17]
to transition between uh one and the

[06:16:15 - 06:16:18]
other but here is a diagram that you'll

[06:16:17 - 06:16:20]
see a lot every time you look up a tree

[06:16:18 - 06:16:22]
of thought everyone's using the same

[06:16:20 - 06:16:24]
diagram so I pulled it as well and so

[06:16:22 - 06:16:25]
here you see on a you have input output

[06:16:24 - 06:16:27]
prompting so that's just where you give

[06:16:25 - 06:16:29]
it an input and you get an output like

[06:16:27 - 06:16:33]
zero or F shot Chain of Thought

[06:16:29 - 06:16:35]
prompting where we will tell it to um uh

[06:16:33 - 06:16:37]
think about things through it then we

[06:16:35 - 06:16:40]
have self-consistency with uh Chain of

[06:16:37 - 06:16:42]
Thought and and uh and self-consistency

[06:16:40 - 06:16:44]
so this is where it produces multiple

[06:16:42 - 06:16:45]
things and uses voting to come to a

[06:16:44 - 06:16:47]
final result I don't think we made a

[06:16:45 - 06:16:49]
slide on this but it is another thing

[06:16:47 - 06:16:52]
that we can do and then you have tree of

[06:16:49 - 06:16:55]
thought where um it has multiple ways

[06:16:52 - 06:16:59]
that it can go through uh uh logic it

[06:16:55 - 06:17:02]
can add branches remove branches the

[06:16:59 - 06:17:05]
idea is that it's not taking a um a

[06:17:02 - 06:17:07]
linear line it's going to evaluate

[06:17:05 - 06:17:08]
multiple options to get to the end so

[06:17:07 - 06:17:10]
this one's a lot more complex but I

[06:17:08 - 06:17:12]
thought it was just really cool to uh

[06:17:10 - 06:17:15]
demonstrate here

[06:17:12 - 06:17:18]
[Music]

[06:17:15 - 06:17:19]
okay hey this is Andrew Brown and I want

[06:17:18 - 06:17:22]
to see if we can figure out how to do

[06:17:19 - 06:17:24]
tree of thought prompting it's not uh

[06:17:22 - 06:17:26]
super easy to do so I'm hoping that we

[06:17:24 - 06:17:27]
can leverage something like prompt Hub

[06:17:26 - 06:17:29]
where they say they already have an

[06:17:27 - 06:17:31]
existing template that they that we can

[06:17:29 - 06:17:33]
work with I'm finding all the examples

[06:17:31 - 06:17:35]
online are showing um uh one with the

[06:17:33 - 06:17:38]
game of 24 and then the other one is

[06:17:35 - 06:17:40]
creative writing so maybe if we can get

[06:17:38 - 06:17:43]
one of these templates from wherever we

[06:17:40 - 06:17:45]
can get started here but I do believe

[06:17:43 - 06:17:48]
they have a button here tree of thought

[06:17:45 - 06:17:49]
prompting and so now we can go take out

[06:17:48 - 06:17:51]
take a look at promp tuub which is a

[06:17:49 - 06:17:52]
place where you can manage prompts which

[06:17:51 - 06:17:54]
is not a total bad idea I'm going to go

[06:17:52 - 06:17:55]
ahead and sign up here and make a new

[06:17:54 - 06:17:57]
account and we'll take a look and see if

[06:17:55 - 06:17:59]
we can see that prompt in here so I've

[06:17:57 - 06:18:01]
just verified my email I'm going to

[06:17:59 - 06:18:03]
continue on here and I'm just going to

[06:18:01 - 06:18:05]
skip here set up your teams key so we

[06:18:03 - 06:18:08]
could put an open AI I key in here and

[06:18:05 - 06:18:10]
luckily I do have open AI so maybe

[06:18:08 - 06:18:14]
that's not a bad idea to go give that a

[06:18:10 - 06:18:16]
try um of course you'll need an open AI

[06:18:14 - 06:18:18]
count to do this we do this many times

[06:18:16 - 06:18:19]
throughout this course so if you're not

[06:18:18 - 06:18:21]
familiar with this you'll have to watch

[06:18:19 - 06:18:23]
just watch for now and you can always

[06:18:21 - 06:18:24]
come back to this video later on I

[06:18:23 - 06:18:26]
already have a basic project set up here

[06:18:24 - 06:18:27]
you create new projects I'm go to manage

[06:18:26 - 06:18:29]
projects I'm going to make my way over

[06:18:27 - 06:18:32]
to API keys I clearly already have an

[06:18:29 - 06:18:33]
API key I'm going to go ahead and revoke

[06:18:32 - 06:18:35]
this key I'm going to go ahead and make

[06:18:33 - 06:18:38]
a new k key and it's going be called

[06:18:35 - 06:18:39]
prompt Hub we're just trying to get into

[06:18:38 - 06:18:41]
promp Hub so that we already have an

[06:18:39 - 06:18:43]
existing template because they're

[06:18:41 - 06:18:45]
promising that there's some template

[06:18:43 - 06:18:47]
here right um we'll go ahead and dump

[06:18:45 - 06:18:50]
that key in there we'll hit save and

[06:18:47 - 06:18:52]
continue uh I don't have anyone else to

[06:18:50 - 06:18:55]
invite let's go and make our way into

[06:18:52 - 06:18:57]
promp TB so we are now in promp tab I

[06:18:55 - 06:18:59]
want to see some of these templates

[06:18:57 - 06:19:00]
let's go over to here and see what else

[06:18:59 - 06:19:04]
we

[06:19:00 - 06:19:08]
have so what I'm looking for in here

[06:19:04 - 06:19:11]
is chain of Destiny that's funny um I'm

[06:19:08 - 06:19:12]
looking for uh tree of thought so that's

[06:19:11 - 06:19:14]
what we we want to find here so I'm

[06:19:12 - 06:19:16]
going to go ahead and type in tree of

[06:19:14 - 06:19:18]
thought maybe we can get it if we go

[06:19:16 - 06:19:20]
back over to here and click this

[06:19:18 - 06:19:22]
again okay and then it will bring us

[06:19:20 - 06:19:24]
exactly to the template that we want and

[06:19:22 - 06:19:26]
so here's an example of the tree of

[06:19:24 - 06:19:27]
thoughts uh one we'll read through and

[06:19:26 - 06:19:29]
try to figure out what we have here so a

[06:19:27 - 06:19:30]
prompting method that instructs the elm

[06:19:29 - 06:19:32]
to Traverse many different paths when

[06:19:30 - 06:19:35]
completing a task movie recommender is

[06:19:32 - 06:19:37]
used for example task update the

[06:19:35 - 06:19:39]
variable and steps for your use case so

[06:19:37 - 06:19:41]
you are a super intelligent movie

[06:19:39 - 06:19:43]
recommender AI here's your task your

[06:19:41 - 06:19:46]
goal is to leverage this information and

[06:19:43 - 06:19:49]
use tree of thoughts method to come uh

[06:19:46 - 06:19:50]
to come to an optimal conclusion so

[06:19:49 - 06:19:52]
understanding friends preferences review

[06:19:50 - 06:19:56]
the hardcoded movie preferences provided

[06:19:52 - 06:19:59]
for each friend oh okay

[06:19:56 - 06:20:00]
um uh create a list of unique movie

[06:19:59 - 06:20:03]
characteristics including favorite

[06:20:00 - 06:20:06]
genres preferred actors and any specific

[06:20:03 - 06:20:09]
movie elements uh they enjoy using the

[06:20:06 - 06:20:11]
gathered preferences generate a list of

[06:20:09 - 06:20:13]
potential movie options that will align

[06:20:11 - 06:20:15]
um evaluate the potential movie options

[06:20:13 - 06:20:17]
based on each friend's preference you

[06:20:15 - 06:20:21]
can assign a value of 1 to 10 to each

[06:20:17 - 06:20:23]
movie representing how well it's it it

[06:20:21 - 06:20:24]
matches its interest now that you have a

[06:20:23 - 06:20:26]
list of movies with the corresponding

[06:20:24 - 06:20:28]
scores review the evaluations and select

[06:20:26 - 06:20:31]
the movies that receive the highest

[06:20:28 - 06:20:34]
overall score consider uh considering

[06:20:31 - 06:20:36]
the combined preferen of all all friends

[06:20:34 - 06:20:37]
finally finally reveal the perfect movie

[06:20:36 - 06:20:39]
Choice output the selected movie that's

[06:20:37 - 06:20:41]
a lot of stuff going on there how can

[06:20:39 - 06:20:43]
that do in all one go I cannot imagine

[06:20:41 - 06:20:45]
it would do that so use the tree of

[06:20:43 - 06:20:46]
thought method to navigate through steps

[06:20:45 - 06:20:48]
and generate the best movie

[06:20:46 - 06:20:50]
recommendation for friends so this

[06:20:48 - 06:20:52]
sounds cool um how can we go ahead and

[06:20:50 - 06:20:55]
utilize so we can hit add to

[06:20:52 - 06:20:58]
library so now we have it here and since

[06:20:55 - 06:21:01]
this is hook up to gen I'm assuming that

[06:20:58 - 06:21:07]
we can input the stuff here is the

[06:21:01 - 06:21:10]
task Okay so I'm here we have a preset

[06:21:07 - 06:21:11]
here this is on turbo I like how it

[06:21:10 - 06:21:14]
shows the price here that's actually

[06:21:11 - 06:21:16]
really smart but I'm utilizing um GPT 4

[06:21:14 - 06:21:18]
usually I think it's also more cost

[06:21:16 - 06:21:20]
effective and by the way if you don't

[06:21:18 - 06:21:22]
have paid you can just watch me do this

[06:21:20 - 06:21:23]
and we'll find out here but I think the

[06:21:22 - 06:21:26]
the version went down here but I like

[06:21:23 - 06:21:29]
how they have that

[06:21:26 - 06:21:29]
um

[06:21:30 - 06:21:36]
okay so I guess my question is how am I

[06:21:33 - 06:21:36]
inserting

[06:21:38 - 06:21:42]
this here is your

[06:21:42 - 06:21:45]
task

[06:21:47 - 06:21:51]
okay so I'm not 100% certain on how to

[06:21:50 - 06:21:53]
utilize this let's go look at another

[06:21:51 - 06:21:55]
one

[06:21:53 - 06:21:59]
here article content code so let's go

[06:21:55 - 06:22:04]
take a look here and say prompted Hub uh

[06:21:59 - 06:22:04]
variables like they don't really explain

[06:22:06 - 06:22:11]
prompt Hub they're not really explaining

[06:22:09 - 06:22:13]
how to set those

[06:22:11 - 06:22:14]
there just give me a second here let's

[06:22:13 - 06:22:15]
find out all right so there're

[06:22:14 - 06:22:18]
suggesting there's a thing called

[06:22:15 - 06:22:19]
variable let's this one so let's go take

[06:22:18 - 06:22:21]
a look and see if that's true so we'll

[06:22:19 - 06:22:24]
go over to here back to promp

[06:22:21 - 06:22:24]
tuub

[06:22:25 - 06:22:29]
um all right well what we can just hit

[06:22:27 - 06:22:34]
run test and find out what

[06:22:29 - 06:22:35]
happens run test I think it's doing it

[06:22:34 - 06:22:40]
how many

[06:22:35 - 06:22:42]
times I'm not sure uh oh how many times

[06:22:40 - 06:22:43]
is it running once twice three times so

[06:22:42 - 06:22:47]
I guess it's

[06:22:43 - 06:22:49]
running great so now where's the Run can

[06:22:47 - 06:22:49]
I see

[06:22:53 - 06:22:57]
[Music]

[06:22:58 - 06:23:03]
it well this is gpg 40 that look kind of

[06:23:01 - 06:23:07]
looks like this is the output of the

[06:23:03 - 06:23:07]
last uh test run one second

[06:23:07 - 06:23:12]
ago introduction prompt engineering Okay

[06:23:10 - 06:23:13]
cool so right away it's already um

[06:23:12 - 06:23:15]
giving us recommendations so I guess it

[06:23:13 - 06:23:17]
actually did all this stuff so it

[06:23:15 - 06:23:20]
basically did all of it oh variables

[06:23:17 - 06:23:23]
here we go ah there we go generate 10

[06:23:20 - 06:23:25]
article ideas for blog posts about

[06:23:23 - 06:23:27]
prompt engineering but this is not

[06:23:25 - 06:23:28]
exactly what we want to happen because

[06:23:27 - 06:23:30]
we need to read this prompt a little bit

[06:23:28 - 06:23:32]
more carefully one more time goals to

[06:23:30 - 06:23:34]
leverage information for tree tree of

[06:23:32 - 06:23:36]
thoughts methods to uh come T an opal

[06:23:34 - 06:23:39]
conclusion review the hardcoded uh movie

[06:23:36 - 06:23:40]
preferences provided for each friend

[06:23:39 - 06:23:43]
create a list of unique movie

[06:23:40 - 06:23:45]
characteristics including favorite

[06:23:43 - 06:23:47]
genres review the hardcode and movie

[06:23:45 - 06:23:50]
preference provided of each friend so

[06:23:47 - 06:23:54]
what we need for this to work so we need

[06:23:50 - 06:23:55]
uh three friends so I need a um I need

[06:23:54 - 06:23:58]
three

[06:23:55 - 06:24:01]
friends and I need to

[06:23:58 - 06:24:06]
know five movies they

[06:24:01 - 06:24:06]
like oh I spelled it wrong

[06:24:07 - 06:24:15]
give me three friends friend

[06:24:10 - 06:24:20]
names and five

[06:24:15 - 06:24:21]
movies movie titles they like okay so

[06:24:20 - 06:24:24]
the idea is I'm just doing this to feed

[06:24:21 - 06:24:24]
it some kind of

[06:24:25 - 06:24:29]
data okay and so we can see we have

[06:24:27 - 06:24:31]
these three folks here we'll go ahead

[06:24:29 - 06:24:34]
and copy this text I'm going to make my

[06:24:31 - 06:24:36]
way back over to here

[06:24:34 - 06:24:38]
and we'll paste this in

[06:24:36 - 06:24:41]
here so now we have that information

[06:24:38 - 06:24:42]
it's not pasted the the nicest way but

[06:24:41 - 06:24:43]
this should be sufficient for this to

[06:24:42 - 06:24:45]
work I going click this again to make

[06:24:43 - 06:24:48]
sure that is set that is set let's go

[06:24:45 - 06:24:51]
ahead and run this again okay so

[06:24:48 - 06:24:54]
now it should do what it's supposed to

[06:24:51 - 06:24:54]
be doing here

[06:25:10 - 06:25:15]
we're give it a moment here all right so

[06:25:12 - 06:25:16]
we have a result back here so step one

[06:25:15 - 06:25:18]
understand friends preference I'm going

[06:25:16 - 06:25:19]
to copy this text over here so we can go

[06:25:18 - 06:25:22]
somewhere else and just have an easier

[06:25:19 - 06:25:23]
time read it just give me one moment all

[06:25:22 - 06:25:27]
right so I've just broaden this uh

[06:25:23 - 06:25:29]
brought this into um vs code and I'm

[06:25:27 - 06:25:30]
just uh previewing it because it did it

[06:25:29 - 06:25:32]
did look like it produced markdown so

[06:25:30 - 06:25:34]
step one understand friends preference

[06:25:32 - 06:25:36]
Rachel seems to enjoy fantasy Adventure

[06:25:34 - 06:25:38]
uh films with a a mix of animation and

[06:25:36 - 06:25:41]
live action her movie list also includes

[06:25:38 - 06:25:44]
a mystery film suggesting she enjoys a

[06:25:41 - 06:25:46]
good plot twist his movie preference is

[06:25:44 - 06:25:48]
towards drama and thrillers and complex

[06:25:46 - 06:25:50]
narratives his list includes films with

[06:25:48 - 06:25:52]
strong performances and thought perform

[06:25:50 - 06:25:55]
thought Pro provoking

[06:25:52 - 06:25:56]
themes um Priya seems to appreciate a

[06:25:55 - 06:25:59]
variety of genres including stuff so we

[06:25:56 - 06:26:01]
go to step two consider the preferences

[06:25:59 - 06:26:04]
of all three some potential movies that

[06:26:01 - 06:26:06]
could suit their task include

[06:26:04 - 06:26:09]
The Dark Knight Lord of the Rings the

[06:26:06 - 06:26:12]
prege ETC EV valuing the movie options

[06:26:09 - 06:26:14]
so here it looks like they are going

[06:26:12 - 06:26:16]
through here so we are getting scored

[06:26:14 - 06:26:18]
values for them select the best movies

[06:26:16 - 06:26:20]
so Lord of the Rings is the highest

[06:26:18 - 06:26:22]
overall score closely fall with the Dark

[06:26:20 - 06:26:24]
Knight Toy Story the perfect movie

[06:26:22 - 06:26:26]
choice for uh movie night would be the

[06:26:24 - 06:26:27]
Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the

[06:26:26 - 06:26:30]
Rings this Epic Fantasy Adventure is

[06:26:27 - 06:26:32]
renowned for ETC so that's really cool

[06:26:30 - 06:26:33]
that it goes through that and what I was

[06:26:32 - 06:26:35]
surprised in the prompt was the fact

[06:26:33 - 06:26:38]
that they just said use tree of thought

[06:26:35 - 06:26:40]
so clearly the model the model must have

[06:26:38 - 06:26:41]
knowledge of how tree of thought works I

[06:26:40 - 06:26:42]
figure like if you're using a dumber

[06:26:41 - 06:26:45]
model and it doesn't know that you might

[06:26:42 - 06:26:47]
have to explain in more description of

[06:26:45 - 06:26:50]
what tree of thought is probably what we

[06:26:47 - 06:26:51]
could do it's like if we go over to here

[06:26:50 - 06:26:55]
and something didn't know tree of

[06:26:51 - 06:26:57]
thought so um I am I am using a smaller

[06:26:55 - 06:27:05]
model that doesn't

[06:26:57 - 06:27:08]
know what tree of thought is what can we

[06:27:05 - 06:27:11]
do to prompt

[06:27:08 - 06:27:11]
it so it

[06:27:11 - 06:27:17]
understands how to perform tree of

[06:27:23 - 06:27:28]
thought outline the steps of true of

[06:27:25 - 06:27:30]
thought okay so explain what it

[06:27:28 - 06:27:32]
is outline the steps combine

[06:27:30 - 06:27:35]
explanations instructions so I guess the

[06:27:32 - 06:27:37]
question is like

[06:27:35 - 06:27:42]
is tree you know is tree of

[06:27:37 - 06:27:44]
thought one shot like one like one

[06:27:42 - 06:27:45]
prompt because you know I was expecting

[06:27:44 - 06:27:47]
for tree of thought to be multiple

[06:27:45 - 06:27:50]
prompts like Chain of Thought or not

[06:27:47 - 06:27:52]
Chain of Thought but uh uh prompt prompt

[06:27:50 - 06:27:54]
chaining right is a reasoning framework

[06:27:52 - 06:27:57]
with a single prompt okay there you go

[06:27:54 - 06:27:59]
so I guess that kind of makes sense um

[06:27:57 - 06:28:01]
about how that could be utilized there

[06:27:59 - 06:28:03]
we go so let's go take a look here at a

[06:28:01 - 06:28:06]
de demonstrative example let's and take

[06:28:03 - 06:28:06]
a look here

[06:28:06 - 06:28:10]
so we will use a step-by-step reasoning

[06:28:08 - 06:28:11]
called tree of thought in this approach

[06:28:10 - 06:28:14]
we will break down the question or

[06:28:11 - 06:28:16]
Problem by exploring multiple branches

[06:28:14 - 06:28:19]
ideas so outline the steps of thoughts

[06:28:16 - 06:28:21]
so restate the problem generaliz uh

[06:28:19 - 06:28:24]
generate possible paths evaluate

[06:28:21 - 06:28:27]
improving branches expand on best branch

[06:28:24 - 06:28:28]
provide the final answer okay so example

[06:28:27 - 06:28:31]
prompt you're an AI sance we're going to

[06:28:28 - 06:28:32]
solve problems using a step-by-step

[06:28:31 - 06:28:34]
reasoning process called train of

[06:28:32 - 06:28:36]
thought restate the problem clearly

[06:28:34 - 06:28:38]
restate the question your own words

[06:28:36 - 06:28:39]
generate possible paths okay so it's

[06:28:38 - 06:28:41]
just saying the same thing so we'll go

[06:28:39 - 06:28:44]
down below here so example question what

[06:28:41 - 06:28:48]
is 15 * 14 restate the problem I want to

[06:28:44 - 06:28:51]
multiply 15 * 14 possible paths Branch a

[06:28:48 - 06:28:52]
branch B Branch C evaluate the branches

[06:28:51 - 06:28:54]
quick approach if we recall it more

[06:28:52 - 06:28:55]
tedious but guaranteed and then this is

[06:28:54 - 06:28:58]
the best branch and expand on that

[06:28:55 - 06:29:01]
Branch okay so that's really cool that's

[06:28:58 - 06:29:02]
starting to make sense to me um so yeah

[06:29:01 - 06:29:05]
I guess that's true of thought there are

[06:29:02 - 06:29:06]
so many techniques to prompt

[06:29:05 - 06:29:07]
engineering like I'm not sure if I

[06:29:06 - 06:29:11]
showed this in a previous video but if

[06:29:07 - 06:29:14]
we go over to um prompt engineering

[06:29:11 - 06:29:16]
prompt engineering website is it this

[06:29:14 - 06:29:19]
one there's so many prompt engineering

[06:29:16 - 06:29:23]
websites now um some are good some are

[06:29:19 - 06:29:25]
bad uh prompt engineering

[06:29:23 - 06:29:28]
guide here it is like this one I like

[06:29:25 - 06:29:29]
quite a bit and so you know there's just

[06:29:28 - 06:29:32]
so many techniques and ways of doing

[06:29:29 - 06:29:34]
prompt engineering um a lot of times

[06:29:32 - 06:29:38]
when you are using

[06:29:34 - 06:29:40]
uh using LMS you end up

[06:29:38 - 06:29:42]
inherently uh using a prompt technique

[06:29:40 - 06:29:44]
without realizing that you're doing it

[06:29:42 - 06:29:46]
so um I think I mentioned this before

[06:29:44 - 06:29:50]
but like when we were doing the Japanese

[06:29:46 - 06:29:52]
subtitle thing I was using some form of

[06:29:50 - 06:29:54]
state and transition management which

[06:29:52 - 06:29:56]
looks very similar to tree of thought um

[06:29:54 - 06:29:59]
and like prompt flowing uh I ended up

[06:29:56 - 06:30:01]
using that intentionally as well so or

[06:29:59 - 06:30:04]
prompt promp chaining so I just would

[06:30:01 - 06:30:06]
say don't worry so much about memorizing

[06:30:04 - 06:30:08]
all these prompt engineering techniques

[06:30:06 - 06:30:10]
um but you'll just find that you will

[06:30:08 - 06:30:12]
indirectly use them but it does help to

[06:30:10 - 06:30:15]
generally know some of them and come

[06:30:12 - 06:30:16]
back and review to see you go oh yeah

[06:30:15 - 06:30:18]
okay I am using prompt engineering I

[06:30:16 - 06:30:19]
just didn't realize I'm I'm doing that

[06:30:18 - 06:30:20]
there's also a big argument about the

[06:30:19 - 06:30:22]
difference between prompt engineering

[06:30:20 - 06:30:24]
prompt designing so some folks would

[06:30:22 - 06:30:26]
call using this just called prompt

[06:30:24 - 06:30:29]
designing and prompt engineering

[06:30:26 - 06:30:31]
requires a lot more uh technical um

[06:30:29 - 06:30:33]
coding behaviors uh to orchestrate

[06:30:31 - 06:30:34]
something a lot larger than simply

[06:30:33 - 06:30:36]
writing a prompt

[06:30:34 - 06:30:37]
I'm not going to fuss about prompt

[06:30:36 - 06:30:39]
design versus prompt engineering I'm

[06:30:37 - 06:30:41]
just considering it all prompt

[06:30:39 - 06:30:44]
engineering uh but yeah there you

[06:30:41 - 06:30:47]
[Music]

[06:30:44 - 06:30:48]
go let's take a look at co-star so

[06:30:47 - 06:30:51]
co-star is a prompting framework created

[06:30:48 - 06:30:54]
by Sheila uh to um and it basically

[06:30:51 - 06:30:56]
follows um this I think it was what it

[06:30:54 - 06:30:59]
called a pneumonic uh context objective

[06:30:56 - 06:31:01]
style tone audience and response so this

[06:30:59 - 06:31:03]
is nothing super fancy it's just a

[06:31:01 - 06:31:06]
prompt uh prompt template you can

[06:31:03 - 06:31:07]
utilize I use something similar but the

[06:31:06 - 06:31:09]
idea is that you provided a context so

[06:31:07 - 06:31:11]
you say what are you doing so here it

[06:31:09 - 06:31:13]
says a free online introductory Japanese

[06:31:11 - 06:31:15]
language workshop for beginners the

[06:31:13 - 06:31:16]
objective encourage people to register

[06:31:15 - 06:31:18]
by highlighting the quick fun

[06:31:16 - 06:31:20]
interactive nature of the session style

[06:31:18 - 06:31:23]
engaging inviting uh clear educational

[06:31:20 - 06:31:25]
tone uh tone persuasive yet friendly

[06:31:23 - 06:31:27]
it's weird that the style says tone but

[06:31:25 - 06:31:29]
then we have tone down below well that's

[06:31:27 - 06:31:31]
okay we have audience busy uh busy

[06:31:29 - 06:31:32]
adults curious about language learning

[06:31:31 - 06:31:36]
with no prior experience response to

[06:31:32 - 06:31:38]
concise impact impact Facebook post so

[06:31:36 - 06:31:40]
this is just one of many ways that you

[06:31:38 - 06:31:41]
can format a document but because it's

[06:31:40 - 06:31:43]
called co-star I thought maybe it might

[06:31:41 - 06:31:46]
be easy for people to remember and adopt

[06:31:43 - 06:31:48]
as a way of making prompt documents to

[06:31:46 - 06:31:49]
get a result that you want uh but there

[06:31:48 - 06:31:52]
you

[06:31:49 - 06:31:54]
[Music]

[06:31:52 - 06:31:55]
go hey this is angrew brown in this

[06:31:54 - 06:31:57]
video I want to see if there's a way

[06:31:55 - 06:32:01]
that we can Implement react prompting

[06:31:57 - 06:32:03]
now there are um Solutions out there uh

[06:32:01 - 06:32:05]
that are managed but um I want to see if

[06:32:03 - 06:32:07]
we can write this from scratch as I

[06:32:05 - 06:32:09]
don't believe that it would be very very

[06:32:07 - 06:32:11]
difficult to figure out uh but maybe

[06:32:09 - 06:32:13]
what we can do looks like there's a

[06:32:11 - 06:32:16]
video down here what we can do is see if

[06:32:13 - 06:32:22]
we can use chbt to write it ourselves so

[06:32:16 - 06:32:27]
I want to implement a um llm

[06:32:22 - 06:32:31]
solution that uses react prompt

[06:32:27 - 06:32:34]
prompting how can I implement

[06:32:31 - 06:32:37]
this okay and so we'll we'll take a look

[06:32:34 - 06:32:40]
here and see what we can do here we'll

[06:32:37 - 06:32:42]
give it just a moment here I'll get my

[06:32:40 - 06:32:44]
head out of the way all right so I've

[06:32:42 - 06:32:46]
asked chbt let's implement it but I

[06:32:44 - 06:32:48]
don't want to implement it utilizing

[06:32:46 - 06:32:50]
Lang chain or llama index those

[06:32:48 - 06:32:52]
Frameworks would allow us to uh easily

[06:32:50 - 06:32:54]
do that but I really don't want to do

[06:32:52 - 06:32:56]
that as um I do feel that they add an

[06:32:54 - 06:32:59]
extra layer that doesn't help us out

[06:32:56 - 06:33:01]
that much I'm going to go over to GitHub

[06:32:59 - 06:33:03]
and I'm going to go over to our exam Pro

[06:33:01 - 06:33:05]
gen Essentials um just so you know that

[06:33:03 - 06:33:07]
prompt engineering does appear a little

[06:33:05 - 06:33:08]
bit earlier in this course and so if

[06:33:07 - 06:33:10]
this stuff is out of your realm right

[06:33:08 - 06:33:12]
now you can always come back to it when

[06:33:10 - 06:33:14]
you learn a bit more coding and things

[06:33:12 - 06:33:17]
like that um I'm going to open this up

[06:33:14 - 06:33:19]
in GitHub do GitHub codes spaces here

[06:33:17 - 06:33:20]
today if that's okay Sometimes using git

[06:33:19 - 06:33:21]
pod sometimes I'm using GitHub codes

[06:33:20 - 06:33:24]
spaces sometimes I'm using local

[06:33:21 - 06:33:26]
development we like to shake it up here

[06:33:24 - 06:33:27]
um but we'll open that up and as that's

[06:33:26 - 06:33:28]
opening up let's give this a read so

[06:33:27 - 06:33:30]
we'll create a prompt that instructs the

[06:33:28 - 06:33:32]
model on how to respond to the react

[06:33:30 - 06:33:34]
format typically you do something like

[06:33:32 - 06:33:35]
this so we'll have a system prompt so

[06:33:34 - 06:33:37]
you are an AI assistant that can perform

[06:33:35 - 06:33:39]
the following steps reason through

[06:33:37 - 06:33:41]
Problem by describing your thoughts in a

[06:33:39 - 06:33:44]
thought section when you need to use a

[06:33:41 - 06:33:46]
tool output an action section with the

[06:33:44 - 06:33:49]
tool name and its inputs after the tool

[06:33:46 - 06:33:51]
call you'll see an observation and uh

[06:33:49 - 06:33:53]
section with the tool output continue

[06:33:51 - 06:33:55]
the cycle of thought and action

[06:33:53 - 06:33:58]
observation as needed and with a concise

[06:33:55 - 06:33:59]
final answer that answers the user query

[06:33:58 - 06:34:02]
The Chain of Thought in thought sections

[06:33:59 - 06:34:03]
is only visible to you and not part of

[06:34:02 - 06:34:06]
your final answer the user should only

[06:34:03 - 06:34:07]
see the final answer so that sounds

[06:34:06 - 06:34:10]
interesting so

[06:34:07 - 06:34:11]
far uh so the user prompt what is the

[06:34:10 - 06:34:14]
capital France plus uh the capital

[06:34:11 - 06:34:16]
Germany right so perform a single manual

[06:34:14 - 06:34:17]
react step with an llm and so that kind

[06:34:16 - 06:34:19]
of sounds like something that we would

[06:34:17 - 06:34:21]
like to do is to do this manually so I'm

[06:34:19 - 06:34:22]
going to go ahead and copy this and we

[06:34:21 - 06:34:24]
have lots of code laying around this is

[06:34:22 - 06:34:27]
actually old code I can tell right away

[06:34:24 - 06:34:29]
because it has Capital C Capital uh the

[06:34:27 - 06:34:31]
two capitals on there so here it says we

[06:34:29 - 06:34:33]
pass in a list of system Messages Plus

[06:34:31 - 06:34:36]
user and ongoing conversation parsing

[06:34:33 - 06:34:38]
the action observation so let's go back

[06:34:36 - 06:34:40]
over to here and I'm going to switch

[06:34:38 - 06:34:42]
this over

[06:34:40 - 06:34:46]
to uh color themes we're going to turn

[06:34:42 - 06:34:49]
this into dark and I'm going to make a

[06:34:46 - 06:34:51]
oops I'm going to make a new folder here

[06:34:49 - 06:34:53]
yes allow me to paste uh prompt

[06:34:51 - 06:34:54]
engineering

[06:34:53 - 06:34:57]
prompting and we're going to go ahead

[06:34:54 - 06:34:59]
and see if we can implement this react

[06:34:57 - 06:35:01]
ourselves and it's not react the

[06:34:59 - 06:35:03]
JavaScript framework it's react the

[06:35:01 - 06:35:06]
prompting framework so I'm going to go

[06:35:03 - 06:35:09]
here make a basic. pi so this is or so

[06:35:06 - 06:35:11]
not Pi but iron Python

[06:35:09 - 06:35:15]
ynb and we'll also create ourselves a

[06:35:11 - 06:35:18]
newv file we'll also create ourselves a

[06:35:15 - 06:35:24]
new env. example file we'll also create

[06:35:18 - 06:35:27]
ourselves a new um get ignore file um

[06:35:24 - 06:35:30]
I've been using open AI quite a bit and

[06:35:27 - 06:35:32]
uh no we'll keep using it it's fine um I

[06:35:30 - 06:35:34]
do have like a cla a Claud subscription

[06:35:32 - 06:35:35]
with or anthropic subscription with

[06:35:34 - 06:35:36]
credits on it but the only way you'd be

[06:35:35 - 06:35:39]
able to do that is if you'd have to pay

[06:35:36 - 06:35:40]
for it if you don't have the credits or

[06:35:39 - 06:35:42]
a comparable one that's totally okay

[06:35:40 - 06:35:44]
just do your best to follow along with

[06:35:42 - 06:35:45]
whatever solution you have we do have a

[06:35:44 - 06:35:46]
whole section where we show you how to

[06:35:45 - 06:35:48]
programmatically work with stuff in the

[06:35:46 - 06:35:50]
workbenches playground section so if you

[06:35:48 - 06:35:52]
have yet to do so go check out that

[06:35:50 - 06:35:55]
stuff but I'm going to make my way over

[06:35:52 - 06:35:57]
to the um AI open AI implementation here

[06:35:55 - 06:35:59]
which is over here um and I'm going to

[06:35:57 - 06:36:01]
grab some of this code to get started

[06:35:59 - 06:36:02]
with so here this one is actually a

[06:36:01 - 06:36:04]
really good example I'm just actually

[06:36:02 - 06:36:06]
just going to copy this this and save

[06:36:04 - 06:36:09]
myself some trouble um and then I'm just

[06:36:06 - 06:36:10]
going to paste it into here and let it

[06:36:09 - 06:36:13]
replace

[06:36:10 - 06:36:17]
it I'm going to delete this

[06:36:13 - 06:36:17]
one and I'll rename

[06:36:18 - 06:36:21]
this

[06:36:22 - 06:36:30]
ipynb and I'm going to need a key from

[06:36:25 - 06:36:30]
open AI so we'll go over to

[06:36:30 - 06:36:35]
here we'll give it a moment here

[06:36:36 - 06:36:40]
I'm going to go over to API uh API login

[06:36:38 - 06:36:41]
and I'm going to make my way over to my

[06:36:40 - 06:36:42]
basic project if you don't have a

[06:36:41 - 06:36:44]
project go ahead and create one I'm

[06:36:42 - 06:36:46]
going to go over to API keys I have one

[06:36:44 - 06:36:48]
here from earlier I'm going to delete

[06:36:46 - 06:36:51]
this key we're going to create a new key

[06:36:48 - 06:36:52]
this one's going to be called react and

[06:36:51 - 06:36:54]
I'm going to place this into the basic

[06:36:52 - 06:36:57]
project it will generate out a new key

[06:36:54 - 06:37:01]
for me I'm going to go back over to here

[06:36:57 - 06:37:02]
and go into the EnV um I'm going to go

[06:37:01 - 06:37:05]
into the open AI one because this is

[06:37:02 - 06:37:07]
what we need is these three things I'll

[06:37:05 - 06:37:09]
paste this into the example here also

[06:37:07 - 06:37:11]
while I don't forget I'm going to Dov

[06:37:09 - 06:37:14]
here and then we'll go back we'll copy

[06:37:11 - 06:37:17]
this we'll go up to here and I'm going

[06:37:14 - 06:37:19]
to bring this down and this is the key

[06:37:17 - 06:37:20]
that goes into the first part so we'll

[06:37:19 - 06:37:23]
cut that out we'll place it in here and

[06:37:20 - 06:37:25]
so I need a project ID and an org ID so

[06:37:23 - 06:37:28]
I'm going to go back over to here and

[06:37:25 - 06:37:30]
we'll go into API login and on the left

[06:37:28 - 06:37:34]
hand side we'll go over

[06:37:30 - 06:37:36]
to basic into manage projects um here I

[06:37:34 - 06:37:40]
can grab

[06:37:36 - 06:37:42]
the actual uh thing I want which is the

[06:37:40 - 06:37:45]
basic so grab

[06:37:42 - 06:37:47]
that and I believe that was the project

[06:37:45 - 06:37:49]
ID and then we'll go back over to here

[06:37:47 - 06:37:51]
put done and I'm going to make my way

[06:37:49 - 06:37:54]
over to getting a little bit confused

[06:37:51 - 06:37:56]
where I am uh yeah organization General

[06:37:54 - 06:37:58]
and so here we can grab an organization

[06:37:56 - 06:37:59]
ID we'll go back over to here we'll

[06:37:58 - 06:38:02]
paste this in and so now we have those

[06:37:59 - 06:38:04]
three set okay so those are all set

[06:38:02 - 06:38:07]
let's go back over to what's going on

[06:38:04 - 06:38:08]
here I think I named the file wrong it's

[06:38:07 - 06:38:10]
not supposed to be a

[06:38:08 - 06:38:13]
folder oh darn I'm going to delete this

[06:38:10 - 06:38:16]
one second and I'm going to go ahead and

[06:38:13 - 06:38:16]
copy this

[06:38:17 - 06:38:22]
again and then I'm going to paste it in

[06:38:19 - 06:38:25]
here there we go and so this should now

[06:38:22 - 06:38:27]
all be configured to work um this is not

[06:38:25 - 06:38:28]
really the example that we want but

[06:38:27 - 06:38:30]
let's go ahead just make sure that it

[06:38:28 - 06:38:32]
works I'm going to go ahead and let it

[06:38:30 - 06:38:35]
install python Jupiter whatever it needs

[06:38:32 - 06:38:38]
install python down here as as

[06:38:35 - 06:38:40]
well okay we'll give it a

[06:38:38 - 06:38:43]
moment okay so we'll go to python

[06:38:40 - 06:38:47]
environments here we'll choose 3

[06:38:43 - 06:38:50]
12 so we'll run this code here give it a

[06:38:47 - 06:38:51]
moment and then we'll import our

[06:38:50 - 06:38:53]
environment variables and we'll just

[06:38:51 - 06:38:56]
make sure that this still

[06:38:53 - 06:38:59]
works okay so it does so now the next

[06:38:56 - 06:39:01]
thing is to incorporate from chat TBT

[06:38:59 - 06:39:04]
some of the outputs we have here so the

[06:39:01 - 06:39:06]
first thing is that we need to have this

[06:39:04 - 06:39:08]
um system prompt documents we'll go

[06:39:06 - 06:39:13]
ahead and copy

[06:39:08 - 06:39:17]
this and I'm going to make a new line

[06:39:13 - 06:39:17]
here I'll put this

[06:39:17 - 06:39:21]
above I call this one system

[06:39:22 - 06:39:26]
prompt I think if uh was I think it's

[06:39:24 - 06:39:29]
like triples if we do

[06:39:26 - 06:39:32]
triples we can do

[06:39:29 - 06:39:34]
this right there we go and so

[06:39:32 - 06:39:38]
now instead of having this we can be

[06:39:34 - 06:39:42]
have this as our system prompt

[06:39:38 - 06:39:42]
right I'll bring this on to a new

[06:39:44 - 06:39:52]
line okay so we have that that's

[06:39:47 - 06:39:54]
good and we'll go back over to J chat PT

[06:39:52 - 06:39:58]
here and this is our current user

[06:39:54 - 06:40:01]
prompt so we go down here this will be

[06:39:58 - 06:40:01]
user prompt

[06:40:04 - 06:40:09]
and so we have that what is the capital

[06:40:06 - 06:40:09]
plus

[06:40:10 - 06:40:17]
that okay so I'll run this I'll run this

[06:40:15 - 06:40:18]
and I'm not sure what we expect to see

[06:40:17 - 06:40:20]
as a result here but I'm going to go and

[06:40:18 - 06:40:22]
bring this on to a new

[06:40:20 - 06:40:23]
line sometimes I'm iterating on this I

[06:40:22 - 06:40:26]
don't want to call it like a 100 times

[06:40:23 - 06:40:29]
we'll go ahead and run

[06:40:26 - 06:40:32]
this no problem we'll go run

[06:40:29 - 06:40:35]
this and I want the content in here so

[06:40:32 - 06:40:35]
I'll just do this one second

[06:40:35 - 06:40:39]
so here I have the thought thought the

[06:40:36 - 06:40:41]
capital of France is Paris and the

[06:40:39 - 06:40:43]
capital of Germany is Berlin the

[06:40:41 - 06:40:45]
question seems to not ask for a

[06:40:43 - 06:40:48]
mathematical sum but rather to combine

[06:40:45 - 06:40:50]
the two capital names in some way action

[06:40:48 - 06:40:53]
no tools needed for this task I will

[06:40:50 - 06:40:56]
simply formulate the answer observation

[06:40:53 - 06:40:57]
the capitals of France and Germany are

[06:40:56 - 06:41:00]
Paris and Berlin Final Answer Paris and

[06:40:57 - 06:41:03]
Berlin so that's the first example of it

[06:41:00 - 06:41:05]
but let's change it to say what is

[06:41:03 - 06:41:09]
what is the

[06:41:05 - 06:41:13]
weather in uh thunderbay Ontario that's

[06:41:09 - 06:41:13]
my hometown thunderbay Ontario Canada

[06:41:14 - 06:41:18]
today

[06:41:16 - 06:41:21]
today okay so I'm going to go ahead and

[06:41:18 - 06:41:23]
update that I'm going to run this again

[06:41:21 - 06:41:25]
and let's see what we get this time so

[06:41:23 - 06:41:27]
we run that so it says I need to find

[06:41:25 - 06:41:29]
the current weather information for

[06:41:27 - 06:41:31]
Thunder Bay Ontario I will I will look

[06:41:29 - 06:41:34]
for a reliable weather source to get the

[06:41:31 - 06:41:36]
most recent data action get weather

[06:41:34 - 06:41:37]
Thunder Bay whatever so here is saying

[06:41:36 - 06:41:40]
the above action simulates calling a

[06:41:37 - 06:41:42]
weather in the scenario I'm using it to

[06:41:40 - 06:41:44]
gather current data on the weather

[06:41:42 - 06:41:46]
observation assume I received the

[06:41:44 - 06:41:47]
weather data for the Thunder Bay which

[06:41:46 - 06:41:49]
shows the conditions such as temperature

[06:41:47 - 06:41:52]
precipitation General description the

[06:41:49 - 06:41:55]
WEA and Thunder Bay is ETC so the thing

[06:41:52 - 06:41:57]
is is that when you're doing this it's

[06:41:55 - 06:42:00]
producing a thought and then we have an

[06:41:57 - 06:42:02]
action and so here it needs to call this

[06:42:00 - 06:42:05]
function it's telling us right here what

[06:42:02 - 06:42:07]
the action it wants to have and so the

[06:42:05 - 06:42:09]
idea is that we can parse that out and

[06:42:07 - 06:42:11]
then call that function and so that is

[06:42:09 - 06:42:13]
what is happening here so D belot says

[06:42:11 - 06:42:16]
perform a single manual react task is

[06:42:13 - 06:42:18]
fine so we have action observation and

[06:42:16 - 06:42:21]
so the idea is that so check if the

[06:42:18 - 06:42:23]
models produce an action it did if so

[06:42:21 - 06:42:26]
parse out which tool it wants to use and

[06:42:23 - 06:42:28]
the input run the tool in Python to get

[06:42:26 - 06:42:31]
a result aend an observation message to

[06:42:28 - 06:42:34]
the conversation call the llm so append

[06:42:31 - 06:42:36]
an observation message to the

[06:42:34 - 06:42:38]
call the elm again with the new uh

[06:42:36 - 06:42:40]
conversation context repeat until we get

[06:42:38 - 06:42:42]
the final answer okay so here they have

[06:42:40 - 06:42:43]
this big iterative process but it's a

[06:42:42 - 06:42:47]
lot simpler than we think here so here

[06:42:43 - 06:42:49]
we have that function but what we'll do

[06:42:47 - 06:42:51]
here like we need some way of parsing

[06:42:49 - 06:42:53]
out the action so I'm going to go here

[06:42:51 - 06:42:56]
and just say

[06:42:53 - 06:42:56]
um this is

[06:42:58 - 06:43:08]
what looks like in the text

[06:43:03 - 06:43:08]
how can I parse it out using

[06:43:11 - 06:43:15]
python all right and you could even tell

[06:43:13 - 06:43:17]
the LM like how it should display

[06:43:15 - 06:43:19]
actions we're not doing that right now

[06:43:17 - 06:43:22]
but we're just going to try to figure

[06:43:19 - 06:43:22]
out how to extract the text that we

[06:43:22 - 06:43:28]
have so we'll give that a moment here to

[06:43:25 - 06:43:29]
just give us some code back oh weird it

[06:43:28 - 06:43:30]
didn't actually do the thing we asked it

[06:43:29 - 06:43:34]
to do so I'm going to ask it to run it

[06:43:30 - 06:43:34]
again it didn't actually do it

[06:43:37 - 06:43:42]
so we we'll ask it again so hey you

[06:43:40 - 06:43:42]
didn't give me any

[06:43:43 - 06:43:47]
code so we'll just ask her to do that

[06:43:53 - 06:43:57]
again so here we have a regular

[06:43:55 - 06:43:59]
expression where we're grabbing the text

[06:43:57 - 06:44:01]
I'm going to see if this will work so

[06:43:59 - 06:44:03]
we'll bring this

[06:44:01 - 06:44:05]
over I'll make a new line here so we're

[06:44:03 - 06:44:07]
importing regular

[06:44:05 - 06:44:09]
Expressions we're doing a pattern

[06:44:07 - 06:44:12]
matching here for our our our

[06:44:09 - 06:44:14]
thing um and then here we are trying to

[06:44:12 - 06:44:16]
do our

[06:44:14 - 06:44:19]
match okay so we are bringing our text

[06:44:16 - 06:44:21]
our text here is this so I'm going to go

[06:44:19 - 06:44:24]
and change this a little bit I'm just

[06:44:21 - 06:44:26]
going to cut this out I say text here

[06:44:24 - 06:44:26]
we'll still print it out so now we have

[06:44:26 - 06:44:30]
our

[06:44:26 - 06:44:32]
text and so then we'll go down here and

[06:44:30 - 06:44:33]
print this next and we got tool get

[06:44:32 - 06:44:35]
weather

[06:44:33 - 06:44:37]
Thunder Bay whatever like Thunder Bay

[06:44:35 - 06:44:39]
onor Canada so now what we're doing is

[06:44:37 - 06:44:42]
we would Define a

[06:44:39 - 06:44:45]
function um called get

[06:44:42 - 06:44:48]
weather right and then we' have an

[06:44:45 - 06:44:49]
input and we're hardcoding this so we're

[06:44:48 - 06:44:51]
not doing for real but let's just say

[06:44:49 - 06:44:54]
input

[06:44:51 - 06:44:54]
equals

[06:44:58 - 06:45:04]
this or you know what let's go out chat

[06:45:00 - 06:45:08]
jbt um How can I I get the current

[06:45:04 - 06:45:11]
weather using an API for

[06:45:08 - 06:45:13]
python okay let's see if we can get an

[06:45:11 - 06:45:15]
example here maybe we can implement it

[06:45:13 - 06:45:15]
for

[06:45:20 - 06:45:24]
real okay create a free account on open

[06:45:22 - 06:45:25]
weather map sure let's go ahead and try

[06:45:24 - 06:45:29]
that

[06:45:25 - 06:45:33]
then so go here

[06:45:29 - 06:45:35]
and okay that's fine that's fine

[06:45:33 - 06:45:37]
sign in well let's go first take a look

[06:45:35 - 06:45:37]
at pricing

[06:45:38 - 06:45:41]
pricing

[06:45:43 - 06:45:47]
um yeah there's there's a free one 60

[06:45:46 - 06:45:49]
calls per minute so we'll go ahead and

[06:45:47 - 06:45:52]
do that I'm going to just make a new

[06:45:49 - 06:45:52]
account

[06:45:55 - 06:46:00]
here and I'm going to generate a new

[06:45:57 - 06:46:04]
password here I'm going to save that I

[06:46:00 - 06:46:06]
am older than 16 I agree

[06:46:04 - 06:46:08]
uh I don't want a bunch of alerts so I'm

[06:46:06 - 06:46:12]
just going to go ahead and do that and

[06:46:08 - 06:46:12]
we will do that I am doing this for

[06:46:12 - 06:46:15]
educational

[06:46:12 - 06:46:18]
[Music]

[06:46:15 - 06:46:20]
purposes exam Pro Training

[06:46:18 - 06:46:23]
Inc

[06:46:20 - 06:46:26]
save okay and so now I need an API key

[06:46:23 - 06:46:27]
we'll go over to here I have a key right

[06:46:26 - 06:46:29]
there so I'm going to go ahead and copy

[06:46:27 - 06:46:32]
it I'm going to go back

[06:46:29 - 06:46:35]
over here let's take a look and so does

[06:46:32 - 06:46:35]
this key have a very particular

[06:46:35 - 06:46:39]
name they're not specifying a particular

[06:46:38 - 06:46:42]
name that's okay so I'm going to go back

[06:46:39 - 06:46:45]
over to here into our code I'm going to

[06:46:42 - 06:46:47]
make a or sorry go to here I'm going to

[06:46:45 - 06:46:52]
add a weather API key what's that thing

[06:46:47 - 06:46:52]
called open Weather open

[06:46:52 - 06:46:55]
Weather open weather

[06:47:00 - 06:47:05]
map and I'll just go back to original

[06:47:03 - 06:47:05]
example

[06:47:06 - 06:47:10]
here open weather

[06:47:18 - 06:47:22]
map like

[06:47:19 - 06:47:26]
that okay so we have our key in here

[06:47:22 - 06:47:26]
right so we'll go back over to

[06:47:26 - 06:47:32]
here and let's go back to our

[06:47:29 - 06:47:34]
code which is here there's a lot going

[06:47:32 - 06:47:36]
on here so hopefully this just works so

[06:47:34 - 06:47:38]
I'm going to copy

[06:47:36 - 06:47:41]
that and we'll go back over to here and

[06:47:38 - 06:47:43]
I'm just going to paste this in here um

[06:47:41 - 06:47:46]
and so we do have that API key somewhere

[06:47:43 - 06:47:49]
in here here it is and so in here I'm

[06:47:46 - 06:47:50]
going to go ahead and say os.

[06:47:49 - 06:47:53]
Environ

[06:47:50 - 06:47:55]
doget and this will be whatever the name

[06:47:53 - 06:47:55]
of this

[06:47:59 - 06:48:05]
is okay so we have this

[06:48:03 - 06:48:07]
it's like it's not knowing what that is

[06:48:05 - 06:48:08]
let's see import OS I I'm pretty sure we

[06:48:07 - 06:48:11]
imported that already but I'll import it

[06:48:08 - 06:48:13]
twice um we have the main part here I

[06:48:11 - 06:48:15]
don't need a main part as this is a

[06:48:13 - 06:48:15]
single

[06:48:16 - 06:48:19]
[Music]

[06:48:23 - 06:48:27]
function so what I'm G to

[06:48:28 - 06:48:31]
do instead of having the API key here

[06:48:30 - 06:48:33]
like this I'm just going to take that

[06:48:31 - 06:48:36]
out like that

[06:48:33 - 06:48:38]
and then I'm just going to grab the API

[06:48:36 - 06:48:41]
key this way right

[06:48:38 - 06:48:43]
here okay and then we'll take this part

[06:48:41 - 06:48:44]
out I mean this is pretty

[06:48:43 - 06:48:47]
straightforward so I'm just going to go

[06:48:44 - 06:48:51]
ahead and delete this part

[06:48:47 - 06:48:53]
out so we have the city name the API key

[06:48:51 - 06:48:55]
use Imperial for Fahrenheit um oh no we

[06:48:53 - 06:48:57]
want magic we're Canadian or at least

[06:48:55 - 06:48:59]
I'm Canadian I'm not sure what you are

[06:48:57 - 06:49:03]
on the other end there so we have a big

[06:48:59 - 06:49:04]
example here of data um that's fine I'm

[06:49:03 - 06:49:08]
going to go ahead and just take this out

[06:49:04 - 06:49:09]
like this and so this is our simplified

[06:49:08 - 06:49:12]
function and we can pass in our city

[06:49:09 - 06:49:15]
name here so the idea is that if we got

[06:49:12 - 06:49:16]
get weather right which we do then we

[06:49:15 - 06:49:17]
want to call this I'm going to Define

[06:49:16 - 06:49:19]
this

[06:49:17 - 06:49:21]
function

[06:49:19 - 06:49:26]
and we have these two things here so I'm

[06:49:21 - 06:49:26]
going to go to our next line and we'll

[06:49:28 - 06:49:33]
say if tool

[06:49:30 - 06:49:37]
name equals

[06:49:33 - 06:49:37]
get weather then we just call this

[06:49:41 - 06:49:45]
function okay and then from here this

[06:49:43 - 06:49:45]
will be the tool

[06:49:50 - 06:49:56]
input all right and so I'm going to go

[06:49:51 - 06:49:58]
up here and just uh say weather

[06:49:56 - 06:49:59]
info and then we'll go down here and

[06:49:58 - 06:50:02]
just say

[06:49:59 - 06:50:03]
print weather info we do have it I'll

[06:50:02 - 06:50:06]
just Dent this that way we'll have less

[06:50:03 - 06:50:07]
of an issue we need a CO in there okay

[06:50:06 - 06:50:10]
so this should in

[06:50:07 - 06:50:12]
theory work the only thing that we need

[06:50:10 - 06:50:14]
to do I'm just going to fix indentation

[06:50:12 - 06:50:17]
here it's acting a bit funny um is we

[06:50:14 - 06:50:19]
need to reload ourv file here because

[06:50:17 - 06:50:21]
this will have those credentials so I've

[06:50:19 - 06:50:22]
reloaded it I'm going to go all the way

[06:50:21 - 06:50:24]
down here I'm going to run this again so

[06:50:22 - 06:50:28]
it loads in that environment variable

[06:50:24 - 06:50:29]
and let's see if our tool works so it is

[06:50:28 - 06:50:33]
trying to call

[06:50:29 - 06:50:37]
it 401 unauthorized for the

[06:50:33 - 06:50:39]
URL okay so it's saying that um our URL

[06:50:37 - 06:50:39]
is

[06:50:40 - 06:50:45]
unauthorized is it

[06:50:42 - 06:50:47]
though I mean it's active right there's

[06:50:45 - 06:50:47]
the API

[06:50:49 - 06:50:53]
key

[06:50:51 - 06:50:55]
okay may I have to confirm my email just

[06:50:53 - 06:50:57]
give me one moment all right so I

[06:50:55 - 06:50:58]
confirmed my email so now I'm curious if

[06:50:57 - 06:51:01]
this is going to work now so we'll go

[06:50:58 - 06:51:04]
back and run this again and try this one

[06:51:01 - 06:51:04]
more time

[06:51:04 - 06:51:10]
unauthorized for URL so maybe it doesn't

[06:51:07 - 06:51:11]
like the URL that's here um so let's go

[06:51:10 - 06:51:13]
back over here I mean this is generated

[06:51:11 - 06:51:15]
by by chat gbt so it might not be

[06:51:13 - 06:51:17]
utilizing the latest thing here so we'll

[06:51:15 - 06:51:19]
go over to the

[06:51:17 - 06:51:21]
API and so this says 3.0 so you can

[06:51:19 - 06:51:24]
already see that there is a

[06:51:21 - 06:51:27]
difference how to make an API

[06:51:24 - 06:51:32]
call and so we see

[06:51:27 - 06:51:32]
this right so I'm going to go back over

[06:51:33 - 06:51:38]
to

[06:51:35 - 06:51:40]
here and so this is data weather so I

[06:51:38 - 06:51:42]
wonder if there's like a weather API end

[06:51:40 - 06:51:42]
point like this

[06:51:43 - 06:51:50]
one to get the access to current weather

[06:51:46 - 06:51:53]
minute forecast for one hour

[06:51:50 - 06:51:53]
um

[06:51:58 - 06:52:05]
okay okay how do I do it by town or city

[06:52:04 - 06:52:09]
click on this

[06:52:05 - 06:52:09]
again API

[06:52:10 - 06:52:13]
docs type in

[06:52:14 - 06:52:17]
City contains four end points and

[06:52:16 - 06:52:19]
provides access to various data so we

[06:52:17 - 06:52:21]
have current weather and

[06:52:19 - 06:52:24]
forast I mean that sounds like what we

[06:52:21 - 06:52:27]
want yes and so the API actually looks

[06:52:24 - 06:52:30]
like this latitude longitude excluding

[06:52:27 - 06:52:32]
part um so maybe you can't just say City

[06:52:30 - 06:52:33]
anymore or maybe the thing was out of

[06:52:32 - 06:52:36]
date

[06:52:33 - 06:52:38]
so here then we'd have to get an

[06:52:36 - 06:52:40]
additional step to get the longitude and

[06:52:38 - 06:52:42]
latitude which is kind of annoying um

[06:52:40 - 06:52:43]
but you know if this works then we'll

[06:52:42 - 06:52:45]
just use utilize this but you can see

[06:52:43 - 06:52:47]
how it wasn't as straightforward as we

[06:52:45 - 06:52:49]
thought it would be so we're going to go

[06:52:47 - 06:52:51]
ahead and we'll paste this in here as

[06:52:49 - 06:52:53]
such

[06:52:51 - 06:52:56]
and I mean it has like the the query

[06:52:53 - 06:52:57]
name this

[06:52:56 - 06:53:03]
way

[06:52:57 - 06:53:03]
um so really we want is lat

[06:53:04 - 06:53:08]
lawn I don't know if we need part we

[06:53:06 - 06:53:11]
probably don't need

[06:53:08 - 06:53:13]
part okay we don't need the API key here

[06:53:11 - 06:53:15]
it's already in here so what we really

[06:53:13 - 06:53:17]
need is the lat and the

[06:53:15 - 06:53:20]
longitude um so this is not going to be

[06:53:17 - 06:53:21]
like a perfect example but like let's

[06:53:20 - 06:53:24]
just assume that we knew what the

[06:53:21 - 06:53:25]
latitude longitude of Thunder Bay was so

[06:53:24 - 06:53:28]
latitude

[06:53:25 - 06:53:30]
longitude Thunder

[06:53:28 - 06:53:33]
Bay which one's the latitude and

[06:53:30 - 06:53:33]
longitude

[06:53:37 - 06:53:42]
um I'm gonna go over here can I get can

[06:53:47 - 06:53:51]
I all right we over to

[06:53:51 - 06:53:56]
here uh decimal 90ga

[06:53:59 - 06:54:04]
90 can you represent

[06:54:04 - 06:54:07]
as

[06:54:05 - 06:54:12]
decimals uh it's probably fine so

[06:54:07 - 06:54:13]
latitude is 48. 3809 that's the latitude

[06:54:12 - 06:54:14]
and I know it's not really how we want

[06:54:13 - 06:54:17]
to do it but I'm just going to hard code

[06:54:14 - 06:54:19]
it in and this is our

[06:54:17 - 06:54:22]
longitude and so then we'll go back over

[06:54:19 - 06:54:24]
to here so even though it's passing the

[06:54:22 - 06:54:25]
city name we're not actually utilizing

[06:54:24 - 06:54:27]
that anywhere um just because we found

[06:54:25 - 06:54:30]
out the parameters do not match what

[06:54:27 - 06:54:33]
we're doing

[06:54:30 - 06:54:34]
here uh oh yeah we need a CO in here

[06:54:33 - 06:54:37]
all right so we'll give this another try

[06:54:34 - 06:54:39]
here we'll run this we'll try to get

[06:54:37 - 06:54:42]
that tool

[06:54:39 - 06:54:46]
again it says unauthorized for 401 so

[06:54:42 - 06:54:48]
here it's attaching the API key is the

[06:54:46 - 06:54:52]
API specified a little bit different

[06:54:48 - 06:54:55]
here this is app ID was that other one

[06:54:52 - 06:54:55]
called API maybe that's

[06:54:55 - 06:55:02]
why no that's right so I don't know we

[06:54:59 - 06:55:04]
we generated a key so in theory it

[06:55:02 - 06:55:04]
should should

[06:55:07 - 06:55:11]
work but it's

[06:55:08 - 06:55:11]
[Music]

[06:55:12 - 06:55:16]
not anyway it's not working and so I'm

[06:55:15 - 06:55:17]
not going to fiddle around with this

[06:55:16 - 06:55:19]
forever and so I'm just going to go

[06:55:17 - 06:55:22]
ahead here and just say I just give me

[06:55:19 - 06:55:25]
mock data so go here uh back over here

[06:55:22 - 06:55:28]
give me mock data for the following

[06:55:25 - 06:55:28]
structure

[06:55:32 - 06:55:37]
okay and we'll just mock it and then

[06:55:34 - 06:55:39]
we'll continue on from here there we go

[06:55:37 - 06:55:41]
so we'll go ahead and grab it like

[06:55:39 - 06:55:44]
this and I'll go back and we'll just go

[06:55:41 - 06:55:44]
here like

[06:55:44 - 06:55:48]
this I would love it to work but you

[06:55:46 - 06:55:51]
know what we're not going to we're not

[06:55:48 - 06:55:53]
going to lose a lot of sleep over it

[06:55:51 - 06:55:56]
here we we know like what we expect to

[06:55:53 - 06:55:59]
receive back here and uh so I'll just

[06:55:56 - 06:56:01]
comment this out for now there we go and

[06:55:59 - 06:56:02]
so I'll go down below here and so that

[06:56:01 - 06:56:05]
will now return this and we go here and

[06:56:02 - 06:56:08]
we'll get back our weather input and so

[06:56:05 - 06:56:10]
now the idea is that if we go back up to

[06:56:08 - 06:56:13]
um our original one

[06:56:10 - 06:56:15]
here so note the uh the above action

[06:56:13 - 06:56:17]
simulates calling a weather uh in this

[06:56:15 - 06:56:19]
scenario I'm using the thing so we'll go

[06:56:17 - 06:56:22]
back over to chat GPT and let's read

[06:56:19 - 06:56:22]
what we're supposed to do next

[06:56:34 - 06:56:41]
yeah so I think we need to specify its

[06:56:37 - 06:56:43]
observation let's go back up to

[06:56:41 - 06:56:46]
here check if the model is produced an

[06:56:43 - 06:56:49]
act if so pars out which tool did run

[06:56:46 - 06:56:52]
the tool in Python to get the results y

[06:56:49 - 06:56:55]
append an observation message to the

[06:56:52 - 06:56:59]
conversation call the elm again with the

[06:56:55 - 06:57:03]
the new context okay great so we have

[06:56:59 - 06:57:05]
that there right and so we have um

[06:57:03 - 06:57:08]
that text prompt from

[06:57:05 - 06:57:10]
earlier and so I think it's if we go

[06:57:08 - 06:57:14]
here print say

[06:57:10 - 06:57:15]
text okay so we have this right and so

[06:57:14 - 06:57:18]
it's saying

[06:57:15 - 06:57:20]
text uh equals

[06:57:18 - 06:57:23]
plus

[06:57:20 - 06:57:25]
observation plus equals I'll just do

[06:57:23 - 06:57:30]
this text text

[06:57:25 - 06:57:30]
plus new line observation

[06:57:36 - 06:57:40]
colon and then here we have weather

[06:57:42 - 06:57:46]
info we'll do this

[06:57:50 - 06:57:57]
here and then I'm going to print

[06:57:53 - 06:57:57]
out updated

[06:57:59 - 06:58:05]
text uh it's kind of okay

[06:58:02 - 06:58:07]
um I'm not sure why it's acting a little

[06:58:05 - 06:58:09]
bit funny but we'll just go ahead here

[06:58:07 - 06:58:11]
make make a new line here like

[06:58:09 - 06:58:12]
this it has a one little extra space

[06:58:11 - 06:58:15]
there but I don't think it's going to

[06:58:12 - 06:58:20]
hurt it so now what we'll do is we'll go

[06:58:15 - 06:58:24]
ahead back up to this part here and then

[06:58:20 - 06:58:27]
copy this here go all the way

[06:58:24 - 06:58:30]
down and we'll go to a new line and so

[06:58:27 - 06:58:32]
now we're going to go to the next line

[06:58:30 - 06:58:36]
here

[06:58:32 - 06:58:39]
so this is our text right that we got

[06:58:36 - 06:58:42]
back uh from that so I think it's

[06:58:39 - 06:58:46]
assistant we write back here right and

[06:58:42 - 06:58:46]
then here we have our updated

[06:58:46 - 06:58:51]
text we hold on a second hold on a

[06:58:49 - 06:58:54]
second this is still user prompt right

[06:58:51 - 06:58:59]
and then we got back our assistant text

[06:58:54 - 06:59:00]
assistant which is the text and then we

[06:58:59 - 06:59:03]
have our updated text here so we're we

[06:59:00 - 06:59:05]
have kind of a bit of a history

[06:59:03 - 06:59:06]
here I assume that's what it wants us to

[06:59:05 - 06:59:10]
do

[06:59:06 - 06:59:13]
right and so we'll run

[06:59:10 - 06:59:15]
this and then we'll

[06:59:13 - 06:59:18]
say got to go back all the way up to

[06:59:15 - 06:59:18]
that other one

[06:59:19 - 06:59:26]
here I'll call this text

[06:59:22 - 06:59:29]
two and we'll run this Final Answer uh

[06:59:26 - 06:59:31]
in Thunder Bay Ontario Canada Day is52

[06:59:29 - 06:59:33]
Celsius so one thing I'm thinking is

[06:59:31 - 06:59:37]
like while we're doing this we could

[06:59:33 - 06:59:39]
have um we could have uh

[06:59:37 - 06:59:41]
probably instead of having like four

[06:59:39 - 06:59:42]
four conversations here we could have

[06:59:41 - 06:59:43]
probably just appended it but I believe

[06:59:42 - 06:59:44]
it feeds it all in here so it doesn't

[06:59:43 - 06:59:46]
really matter but I'm just saying like

[06:59:44 - 06:59:50]
maybe we could have just taken that uh

[06:59:46 - 06:59:52]
assistant prompt and I don't know but

[06:59:50 - 06:59:53]
the point is is that hopefully you

[06:59:52 - 06:59:55]
understand how react works the idea is

[06:59:53 - 06:59:57]
that you're making a thought you get an

[06:59:55 - 06:59:59]
action you have an observation and then

[06:59:57 - 07:00:01]
you have your final answer um and so

[06:59:59 - 07:00:03]
there we were able to do that um there

[07:00:01 - 07:00:04]
are Frameworks that will automate this

[07:00:03 - 07:00:06]
stuff but it's better to know how the

[07:00:04 - 07:00:08]
manual moving pieces work so it's a bit

[07:00:06 - 07:00:10]
easier you can tell the system prompt

[07:00:08 - 07:00:12]
exactly what you expect the tools to be

[07:00:10 - 07:00:14]
you could even tell exactly what tools

[07:00:12 - 07:00:15]
it has because there it was just making

[07:00:14 - 07:00:17]
something up because it didn't know that

[07:00:15 - 07:00:19]
it it it could just make up tools but

[07:00:17 - 07:00:21]
that's what it was doing we'll call this

[07:00:19 - 07:00:24]
one complete so we'll say react example

[07:00:21 - 07:00:28]
and there we go okay

[07:00:24 - 07:00:30]
[Music]

[07:00:28 - 07:00:31]
ciao hey this is Andrew Brown and in

[07:00:30 - 07:00:36]
this video we're going to take a look at

[07:00:31 - 07:00:38]
opening I API and so if we go over here

[07:00:36 - 07:00:40]
um to product their UI on their website

[07:00:38 - 07:00:42]
is awful I don't know why they make it

[07:00:40 - 07:00:44]
so hard to find it and it's very slow

[07:00:42 - 07:00:46]
loading but if you drop it down you can

[07:00:44 - 07:00:49]
get to API login and we actually do use

[07:00:46 - 07:00:50]
open a quite a bit just because I find

[07:00:49 - 07:00:52]
this one one of the easiest ones to

[07:00:50 - 07:00:54]
utilize it's not the best it's just what

[07:00:52 - 07:00:56]
I'm very comfortable with um but when

[07:00:54 - 07:00:57]
you want to start working with it what

[07:00:56 - 07:01:01]
you're going to end up doing is creating

[07:00:57 - 07:01:02]
a bunch of projects um so here there's a

[07:01:01 - 07:01:04]
project that I don't really want anymore

[07:01:02 - 07:01:05]
I'm trying to manage my projects to

[07:01:04 - 07:01:07]
delete this one if it takes a moment

[07:01:05 - 07:01:09]
here but I'm going to go ahead and just

[07:01:07 - 07:01:12]
delete it but you come with a a default

[07:01:09 - 07:01:13]
project as you can see here um and you

[07:01:12 - 07:01:15]
might have to fill in your company

[07:01:13 - 07:01:17]
information you probably do um but the

[07:01:15 - 07:01:19]
idea is that when we want to work on

[07:01:17 - 07:01:22]
something we first create a project and

[07:01:19 - 07:01:24]
say you know basic okay and then from

[07:01:22 - 07:01:26]
there we want to create an API key which

[07:01:24 - 07:01:28]
we can find here on the leth hand side

[07:01:26 - 07:01:29]
and you can see that I have a key from a

[07:01:28 - 07:01:32]
different example before we'll open this

[07:01:29 - 07:01:34]
up and I'll just say uh basic and I'm

[07:01:32 - 07:01:37]
going to go and select that project and

[07:01:34 - 07:01:40]
create it I'm going to make my way over

[07:01:37 - 07:01:43]
to um here and I think I already have

[07:01:40 - 07:01:45]
yep I do an environment open here so

[07:01:43 - 07:01:47]
going to open that up but I use open AI

[07:01:45 - 07:01:48]
quite a bit in this course so you're

[07:01:47 - 07:01:50]
going to see me again and again and

[07:01:48 - 07:01:53]
again do it so I don't feel bad if I'm

[07:01:50 - 07:01:55]
kind of glossing over it um but we'll go

[07:01:53 - 07:01:57]
over here onto the left hand side and

[07:01:55 - 07:02:02]
we'll just give it a

[07:01:57 - 07:02:05]
moment and we will open up open AI

[07:02:02 - 07:02:07]
uh or use open AI so we say open Ai and

[07:02:05 - 07:02:10]
I'll make a new file here called

[07:02:07 - 07:02:13]
basic do

[07:02:10 - 07:02:16]
iy uh here ipynb we'll make another new

[07:02:13 - 07:02:18]
file here called EnV we'll make another

[07:02:16 - 07:02:20]
file in here called

[07:02:18 - 07:02:22]
EnV env.

[07:02:20 - 07:02:24]
example and we'll make another file in

[07:02:22 - 07:02:27]
here called Dog

[07:02:24 - 07:02:30]
ignore okay and I believe the key is

[07:02:27 - 07:02:31]
called open AI API key so that's what

[07:02:30 - 07:02:33]
it's going to be called we'll go back

[07:02:31 - 07:02:35]
over over to our API key we'll copy it

[07:02:33 - 07:02:39]
we're going to paste it into here I'm

[07:02:35 - 07:02:41]
going to go over to the left here and

[07:02:39 - 07:02:42]
copy this part and we'll go back over to

[07:02:41 - 07:02:44]
here and paste it in now we actually

[07:02:42 - 07:02:49]
need a few other things we need a

[07:02:44 - 07:02:50]
project ID and we also need a or ID um

[07:02:49 - 07:02:54]
maybe you don't but I'm pretty certain

[07:02:50 - 07:02:58]
that I do and so I'll go back over here

[07:02:54 - 07:03:02]
to up here to the manage projects and

[07:02:58 - 07:03:04]
from here I can grab the project ID

[07:03:02 - 07:03:07]
uh which is right here so I'll grab that

[07:03:04 - 07:03:08]
here and we'll drop that in there and

[07:03:07 - 07:03:11]
then the next thing I'll do is go to

[07:03:08 - 07:03:13]
General and grab my organizational ID or

[07:03:11 - 07:03:15]
organization ID and so we have that

[07:03:13 - 07:03:17]
there and these are supposed to be in

[07:03:15 - 07:03:20]
the EnV of course so I'll bring that

[07:03:17 - 07:03:24]
over there uh and then just clear these

[07:03:20 - 07:03:27]
out but I'm not sure why I'm

[07:03:24 - 07:03:27]
missing

[07:03:27 - 07:03:34]
my uh open open AI uh API key because I

[07:03:33 - 07:03:38]
thought I just pasted it in here maybe I

[07:03:34 - 07:03:38]
did not let me go take a look at the

[07:03:40 - 07:03:46]
files oh I pasted in the dog ignore well

[07:03:43 - 07:03:50]
there we go that's where it went so

[07:03:46 - 07:03:52]
this cut this out this whole

[07:03:50 - 07:03:55]
thing I'll cut this out here and I'll

[07:03:52 - 07:03:57]
bring this here and I'll drop it into

[07:03:55 - 07:04:00]
here and then we'll go over to here

[07:03:57 - 07:04:01]
we'll ignore the EMV as per usual um and

[07:04:00 - 07:04:03]
so there's a few things when need to

[07:04:01 - 07:04:07]
install the first will be pip install

[07:04:03 - 07:04:07]
hyphen Q python. EnV and then it'll be

[07:04:07 - 07:04:10]
open

[07:04:07 - 07:04:13]
Ai and so I'll go ahead and run that

[07:04:10 - 07:04:15]
we'll go to the next line here I'm going

[07:04:13 - 07:04:18]
to pull for maybe streamlet as we do

[07:04:15 - 07:04:22]
have uh some code here I need this this

[07:04:18 - 07:04:24]
stuff here to load in the um the file so

[07:04:22 - 07:04:26]
that will load the EnV file and now we

[07:04:24 - 07:04:28]
just need some code examples so if we go

[07:04:26 - 07:04:31]
here uh there should be a way we can

[07:04:28 - 07:04:32]
find it if we look up the API reference

[07:04:31 - 07:04:34]
uh they have cooked books down here I

[07:04:32 - 07:04:36]
never go to that ever

[07:04:34 - 07:04:40]
though oh that's cool like we want to do

[07:04:36 - 07:04:40]
structured outputs they have an example

[07:04:40 - 07:04:45]
here uh some these are pretty complex so

[07:04:43 - 07:04:46]
I'm not really sure I'm just looking for

[07:04:45 - 07:04:49]
something that's really

[07:04:46 - 07:04:51]
basic um maybe we'll just look at the

[07:04:49 - 07:04:54]
API API

[07:04:51 - 07:04:57]
docs and uh here we'll go to our quick

[07:04:54 - 07:05:00]
start and so yeah it's open AI API key

[07:04:57 - 07:05:02]
so I got that right and here's a very

[07:05:00 - 07:05:05]
basic example so we'll go ahead and copy

[07:05:02 - 07:05:09]
that and we'll go back over to here

[07:05:05 - 07:05:12]
we'll paste it in

[07:05:09 - 07:05:15]
um is that that doesn't look like python

[07:05:12 - 07:05:19]
that looks like typescript or JavaScript

[07:05:15 - 07:05:21]
so this example here is yeah we want

[07:05:19 - 07:05:24]
python so we'll go over to this one here

[07:05:21 - 07:05:25]
I knew right away that was not Python

[07:05:24 - 07:05:27]
and so we'll paste it in here and I

[07:05:25 - 07:05:29]
actually use GPT 40 mini quite a bit

[07:05:27 - 07:05:30]
these days so we'll go ahead and run

[07:05:29 - 07:05:35]
this we'll see if it

[07:05:30 - 07:05:38]
works and it does now I do

[07:05:35 - 07:05:40]
believe function calls themselves write

[07:05:38 - 07:05:41]
a ha cou about recursive in programming

[07:05:40 - 07:05:43]
okay so I was wondering like why it was

[07:05:41 - 07:05:45]
being kind of weird there but you know I

[07:05:43 - 07:05:47]
do believe that open AI has a free tier

[07:05:45 - 07:05:48]
I'm right now utilizing the paid tier I

[07:05:47 - 07:05:50]
do have some credits loaded up but I

[07:05:48 - 07:05:53]
found like even if you load like $5 on

[07:05:50 - 07:05:55]
these things they last quite a long time

[07:05:53 - 07:05:57]
though the credits do lapse over a year

[07:05:55 - 07:05:59]
so you make sure that you do utilize

[07:05:57 - 07:06:00]
them as that can be very unfortunate but

[07:05:59 - 07:06:03]
that will be our open AI example and

[07:06:00 - 07:06:07]
we'll call this on done and dusted okay

[07:06:03 - 07:06:08]
so we have now utilized open AI but I do

[07:06:07 - 07:06:11]
want to point out that open AI does have

[07:06:08 - 07:06:13]
a really really good playground I mean

[07:06:11 - 07:06:15]
these videos are called um these are

[07:06:13 - 07:06:17]
like playground videos but I really been

[07:06:15 - 07:06:19]
focused on mostly uh working with them

[07:06:17 - 07:06:20]
programmatically but if we go over here

[07:06:19 - 07:06:22]
to the playground we have the chat we

[07:06:20 - 07:06:24]
have a bunch of options there's not much

[07:06:22 - 07:06:26]
to talk about but it is a way that we

[07:06:24 - 07:06:28]
can uh work with the stuff and we might

[07:06:26 - 07:06:31]
come back to these environments later on

[07:06:28 - 07:06:31]
and play around with them okay

[07:06:32 - 07:06:35]
[Music]

[07:06:34 - 07:06:38]
hey this is Andrew Brown in this video

[07:06:35 - 07:06:40]
what I want to explore is utilizing the

[07:06:38 - 07:06:43]
anthropic workbench as that is another

[07:06:40 - 07:06:45]
way to work with anthropic um a lot of

[07:06:43 - 07:06:47]
people might just go ahead and try Claud

[07:06:45 - 07:06:51]
from here and I actually do have a paid

[07:06:47 - 07:06:52]
account which I got just for this um uh

[07:06:51 - 07:06:54]
this boot camp as usually I'm just

[07:06:52 - 07:06:56]
sticking with chat TPT these days but

[07:06:54 - 07:06:59]
the idea is that there is another portal

[07:06:56 - 07:07:01]
somewhere here um if we go over to

[07:06:59 - 07:07:03]
API okay and then we go to start

[07:07:01 - 07:07:05]
building and so that brings us to

[07:07:03 - 07:07:08]
console. anthropic

[07:07:05 - 07:07:09]
docomo workbench sometimes they call

[07:07:08 - 07:07:11]
these workbenches sometimes they call

[07:07:09 - 07:07:14]
these playgrounds I believe that they

[07:07:11 - 07:07:16]
call theirs a workbench and so we are

[07:07:14 - 07:07:19]
now in here yeah we see workbench up

[07:07:16 - 07:07:21]
here um I guess the question is like can

[07:07:19 - 07:07:22]
we utilize this in the free tier I think

[07:07:21 - 07:07:25]
that we have to buy credits to utilize

[07:07:22 - 07:07:27]
it but we can just find out uh by

[07:07:25 - 07:07:29]
working with this directly um So the

[07:07:27 - 07:07:31]
plan is the free plan is for revaluing

[07:07:29 - 07:07:34]
capabilities before commercial use so

[07:07:31 - 07:07:39]
sounds like we can utilize this uh for

[07:07:34 - 07:07:41]
free initially and say my uh my uh my

[07:07:39 - 07:07:43]
key here and let's just see how we can

[07:07:41 - 07:07:45]
programmatically work with anthropic CLA

[07:07:43 - 07:07:47]
so here we have a key I'm going to go

[07:07:45 - 07:07:48]
over to our GitHub repo I'm going to go

[07:07:47 - 07:07:52]
down to gen

[07:07:48 - 07:07:54]
Essentials okay I'm going to go open our

[07:07:52 - 07:07:55]
uh code base

[07:07:54 - 07:07:58]
in

[07:07:55 - 07:07:59]
GitHub uh I'm going to delete this old

[07:07:58 - 07:08:01]
space we'll use GitHub code spaces here

[07:07:59 - 07:08:03]
today it doesn't really matter what you

[07:08:01 - 07:08:06]
use as this is all serverless but I'm

[07:08:03 - 07:08:07]
going to use GitHub um github's Cod

[07:08:06 - 07:08:10]
spaces here today so we'll give a moment

[07:08:07 - 07:08:12]
for that to launch up all right so we

[07:08:10 - 07:08:15]
have launched this up

[07:08:12 - 07:08:17]
here we got color themes um and I want

[07:08:15 - 07:08:19]
to just change this to a darker theme so

[07:08:17 - 07:08:23]
I can see what I'm doing there we go and

[07:08:19 - 07:08:24]
I want to um I mean we do have one for

[07:08:23 - 07:08:27]
Amazon Bedrock over here which is

[07:08:24 - 07:08:30]
working with a API but I'm going to make

[07:08:27 - 07:08:34]
a new one uh here I can call this one

[07:08:30 - 07:08:35]
whoops we'll call this one anthropic

[07:08:34 - 07:08:38]
[Music]

[07:08:35 - 07:08:38]
anthropic

[07:08:38 - 07:08:46]
anthropic and in here I'm going to make

[07:08:40 - 07:08:48]
a new file that I would like to call

[07:08:46 - 07:08:50]
um I guess the question is should it be

[07:08:48 - 07:08:52]
a workbench or should it be the CLI I

[07:08:50 - 07:08:54]
kind of like working in in notebooks so

[07:08:52 - 07:08:56]
maybe we will make this a notebook here

[07:08:54 - 07:08:58]
so I'm going to go ahead and just say

[07:08:56 - 07:09:02]
basic.

[07:08:58 - 07:09:04]
I Y andb which I believe is how we make

[07:09:02 - 07:09:05]
the book and we'll go ahead here and

[07:09:04 - 07:09:07]
we'll just start adding code I'm going

[07:09:05 - 07:09:09]
to use the uh whatever the default

[07:09:07 - 07:09:12]
kernel is here so we'll install and

[07:09:09 - 07:09:14]
enable here so that we can get going

[07:09:12 - 07:09:15]
we'll give it that just a moment all

[07:09:14 - 07:09:17]
right so that's now installed we'll go

[07:09:15 - 07:09:19]
ahead here and just choose whatever the

[07:09:17 - 07:09:22]
default environment is um and so we'll

[07:09:19 - 07:09:24]
go back over to here and we have our API

[07:09:22 - 07:09:26]
key I'm not ready to use it just yet but

[07:09:24 - 07:09:29]
um I think what we can do is just load

[07:09:26 - 07:09:31]
uh put it into ourv file here as I'm

[07:09:29 - 07:09:33]
getting pretty good at loading uh

[07:09:31 - 07:09:35]
external environment variables and I'm

[07:09:33 - 07:09:38]
just going to save that temporarily I'm

[07:09:35 - 07:09:39]
going to go ahead and make a newg ignore

[07:09:38 - 07:09:41]
and in here we're just going to ignore

[07:09:39 - 07:09:44]
the EnV as I don't want to commit that

[07:09:41 - 07:09:47]
to my repo and I know that we will want

[07:09:44 - 07:09:48]
to install whoops sometimes I get those

[07:09:47 - 07:09:49]
five numbers there by accident but we

[07:09:48 - 07:09:52]
want to install

[07:09:49 - 07:09:54]
python. EnV so that will be one thing

[07:09:52 - 07:09:56]
we'll absolutely want to install I need

[07:09:54 - 07:09:59]
to figure out what the anthropic library

[07:09:56 - 07:10:01]
is called I do not know what it is um so

[07:09:59 - 07:10:02]
if we go back over to workbench I know

[07:10:01 - 07:10:04]
they had like that beginner stuff that

[07:10:02 - 07:10:06]
they were showing us stuff but I want to

[07:10:04 - 07:10:07]
get some code so we'll go over to here

[07:10:06 - 07:10:08]
and so this looks like a good start it's

[07:10:07 - 07:10:10]
interesting we have other

[07:10:08 - 07:10:12]
implementations we have for vertex AI

[07:10:10 - 07:10:14]
which is cool and then we also have the

[07:10:12 - 07:10:16]
Bedrock implementation we'll go over to

[07:10:14 - 07:10:18]
python as that's the version that I'm

[07:10:16 - 07:10:21]
going to mostly be utilizing is python

[07:10:18 - 07:10:22]
everywhere all the time even though my

[07:10:21 - 07:10:25]
favorite language is Ruby we'll go ahead

[07:10:22 - 07:10:26]
and we'll paste in this code example and

[07:10:25 - 07:10:28]
so here actually wants to load the

[07:10:26 - 07:10:31]
environment variables which is perfect

[07:10:28 - 07:10:35]
so I'm going to copy this over to here

[07:10:31 - 07:10:37]
and we're going to set uh this value as

[07:10:35 - 07:10:40]
such I'm going to go ahead and just make

[07:10:37 - 07:10:40]
aemv

[07:10:40 - 07:10:47]
examples here and that way when I commit

[07:10:45 - 07:10:49]
this other folks who are running it can

[07:10:47 - 07:10:51]
follow along with their own key so we'll

[07:10:49 - 07:10:53]
go back over to here and so this is the

[07:10:51 - 07:10:57]
default one that will get loaded

[07:10:53 - 07:10:59]
in um so I think we don't even have to

[07:10:57 - 07:11:04]
set a key because it will get pulled

[07:10:59 - 07:11:09]
in but we will have to uh load um python

[07:11:04 - 07:11:12]
dodev so it's like EnV like import. dnv

[07:11:09 - 07:11:15]
import. EnV and then

[07:11:12 - 07:11:17]
env. load it's not autocom completing

[07:11:15 - 07:11:19]
which is fine um but I'm just going to

[07:11:17 - 07:11:21]
go to another example where I know that

[07:11:19 - 07:11:23]
I utilize this here we go and so I just

[07:11:21 - 07:11:25]
want to make sure without a doubt this

[07:11:23 - 07:11:27]
gets imported

[07:11:25 - 07:11:29]
correctly there we

[07:11:27 - 07:11:31]
go okay and so the library that we need

[07:11:29 - 07:11:33]
to install here is um

[07:11:31 - 07:11:35]
ropic I mean that kind of makes sense

[07:11:33 - 07:11:36]
let's go ahead and see if we can get her

[07:11:35 - 07:11:39]
installed to go here probably could have

[07:11:36 - 07:11:41]
done a hyphen Q here to make our lives a

[07:11:39 - 07:11:43]
lot

[07:11:41 - 07:11:47]
cleaner there we go and so now we'll do

[07:11:43 - 07:11:48]
our import and here it's coded for a

[07:11:47 - 07:11:51]
very specific version anthropic we'll go

[07:11:48 - 07:11:51]
ahead and run

[07:11:51 - 07:11:57]
that and it says it's a deprecated model

[07:11:55 - 07:11:59]
so it looks like your credit balance is

[07:11:57 - 07:12:01]
too low to access the anthropic API

[07:11:59 - 07:12:03]
please go to building Etc so I mean we

[07:12:01 - 07:12:05]
just want to evaluate it right and so

[07:12:03 - 07:12:08]
maybe this one in particular is not

[07:12:05 - 07:12:10]
something that we can utilize right away

[07:12:08 - 07:12:12]
and so if we go here what if we went to

[07:12:10 - 07:12:15]
like an older one like Haiku like this

[07:12:12 - 07:12:15]
model in

[07:12:16 - 07:12:19]
particular I mean I know I'm out of

[07:12:18 - 07:12:22]
credits but like I thought I could

[07:12:19 - 07:12:25]
evaluate it maybe I can't so let's go

[07:12:22 - 07:12:29]
take a look

[07:12:25 - 07:12:34]
anthropic workbench does it have a free

[07:12:29 - 07:12:34]
tier I mean if it doesn't that's totally

[07:12:35 - 07:12:39]
fine however please note that the API is

[07:12:37 - 07:12:42]
subject to commercial terms and services

[07:12:39 - 07:12:46]
okay so which model can we use for

[07:12:42 - 07:12:46]
free all right but it's not telling us

[07:12:52 - 07:12:55]
how

[07:12:56 - 07:13:02]
so yeah it's not exactly telling us

[07:12:59 - 07:13:03]
which one it is and so I was hoping that

[07:13:02 - 07:13:05]
we could go in here and maybe we could

[07:13:03 - 07:13:06]
find a very specific model now there are

[07:13:05 - 07:13:08]
some older models here so maybe if we

[07:13:06 - 07:13:10]
choose this older one here there's no

[07:13:08 - 07:13:12]
easy way to copy it but I'm going go

[07:13:10 - 07:13:14]
ahead and say try it no that's not

[07:13:12 - 07:13:16]
really helping me so maybe I'll go right

[07:13:14 - 07:13:18]
click and inspect to get the the content

[07:13:16 - 07:13:21]
here PR they just don't make it easy to

[07:13:18 - 07:13:23]
copy here so I'm just using inspector to

[07:13:21 - 07:13:27]
try to try to grab that

[07:13:23 - 07:13:27]
value so maybe if we

[07:13:27 - 07:13:32]
try this older version of Hau

[07:13:34 - 07:13:36]
then maybe we can use it for free let's

[07:13:35 - 07:13:38]
find

[07:13:36 - 07:13:39]
out I don't know for certain but we're

[07:13:38 - 07:13:42]
just we're just trying some things out

[07:13:39 - 07:13:45]
here so I'm going to go back over to our

[07:13:42 - 07:13:47]
example here I'm just going to say model

[07:13:45 - 07:13:49]
ID and I'm just going to paste it in as

[07:13:47 - 07:13:51]
such I want to keep both of them around

[07:13:49 - 07:13:53]
so I can quickly switch between the two

[07:13:51 - 07:13:55]
and so I'm going to go ahead and just

[07:13:53 - 07:13:57]
grab this one

[07:13:55 - 07:13:58]
here to me it'd be crazy if they even

[07:13:57 - 07:14:01]
had a free tier just because they're

[07:13:58 - 07:14:03]
always um exhausted in terms of their

[07:14:01 - 07:14:05]
resources but we'll go here and just say

[07:14:03 - 07:14:07]
model ID I'm going to comment out the

[07:14:05 - 07:14:09]
top one here we're going to try this

[07:14:07 - 07:14:12]
again and run

[07:14:09 - 07:14:13]
it and it still fail so clearly we need

[07:14:12 - 07:14:17]
to have

[07:14:13 - 07:14:20]
um we need to have

[07:14:17 - 07:14:22]
uh a newer model so let's go over to

[07:14:20 - 07:14:23]
here to maybe a newer model and I'm just

[07:14:22 - 07:14:25]
going to go and try to grab this one

[07:14:23 - 07:14:27]
next actually I can probably just grab

[07:14:25 - 07:14:30]
it from my inspector

[07:14:27 - 07:14:32]
window I'm not fully uh tapped out here

[07:14:30 - 07:14:33]
yet I just want to see maybe it has to

[07:14:32 - 07:14:35]
be the latest model and that's why it's

[07:14:33 - 07:14:35]
still not

[07:14:38 - 07:14:42]
working and so we'll go back over to

[07:14:43 - 07:14:49]
here and I'm going to paste in this one

[07:14:46 - 07:14:51]
instead I don't think anything

[07:14:49 - 07:14:52]
changed so yeah I think I'm just going

[07:14:51 - 07:14:55]
to have to buy some credits and that's

[07:14:52 - 07:14:56]
not a big deal but I was hoping that I

[07:14:55 - 07:14:57]
could show you something with the free

[07:14:56 - 07:14:59]
tier but at least you know that you're

[07:14:57 - 07:15:01]
not really going to be able to easily

[07:14:59 - 07:15:03]
get free tier let's go over to settings

[07:15:01 - 07:15:04]
let's go to building I'm going to load

[07:15:03 - 07:15:06]
myself up with some stuff here so I'm

[07:15:04 - 07:15:07]
going to complete setup and get going

[07:15:06 - 07:15:08]
here okay and I'm just showing you a

[07:15:07 - 07:15:09]
little bit I just clicked on here so I'm

[07:15:08 - 07:15:11]
just showing you a bit of the step

[07:15:09 - 07:15:14]
before I fill in some of my personal

[07:15:11 - 07:15:17]
information um I guess we're small

[07:15:14 - 07:15:21]
business uh we are based in

[07:15:17 - 07:15:24]
Canada it's for both I suppose what task

[07:15:21 - 07:15:27]
will claw be used for educational

[07:15:24 - 07:15:30]
purposes will Claud be used to provide

[07:15:27 - 07:15:32]
legal medical advice no will you be

[07:15:30 - 07:15:33]
incorporating your API into any products

[07:15:32 - 07:15:36]
or Services intended for users under the

[07:15:33 - 07:15:38]
age of 18 no and so we'll hit continue

[07:15:36 - 07:15:40]
and now this is where I will have to

[07:15:38 - 07:15:42]
hide my screen so I'll be back in just a

[07:15:40 - 07:15:44]
moment okay all right so I set billing

[07:15:42 - 07:15:47]
and uh I think for now I'm going to just

[07:15:44 - 07:15:48]
start with $5 as that is a small amount

[07:15:47 - 07:15:50]
Auto reload credits when the balance

[07:15:48 - 07:15:51]
reaches a certain threshold I'm not

[07:15:50 - 07:15:52]
going to do that here today but I'm

[07:15:51 - 07:15:55]
going to go ahead and just complete the

[07:15:52 - 07:15:56]
purchase and so in theory the purchase

[07:15:55 - 07:15:59]
should be completed and I should have

[07:15:56 - 07:16:00]
those $5 but I'll give it a moment here

[07:15:59 - 07:16:03]
there it is so now I should be able to

[07:16:00 - 07:16:05]
to use the API um so let's go over to

[07:16:03 - 07:16:07]
here and take a look at what we have um

[07:16:05 - 07:16:10]
so we'll go back over to here I'm going

[07:16:07 - 07:16:14]
to go ahead and um run this

[07:16:10 - 07:16:15]
here and so it should pick up it says uh

[07:16:14 - 07:16:17]
at least one message is required so now

[07:16:15 - 07:16:18]
it's not an issue of whether it works

[07:16:17 - 07:16:20]
it's just the fact that we don't have a

[07:16:18 - 07:16:22]
message filled in here so I'll go up

[07:16:20 - 07:16:23]
here I'm just going to put in messages

[07:16:22 - 07:16:26]
also bump up the font here a little bit

[07:16:23 - 07:16:28]
it is a little bit small okay and we'll

[07:16:26 - 07:16:31]
bring that on down and I'm going to go

[07:16:28 - 07:16:33]
ahead and bring this here

[07:16:31 - 07:16:35]
so now the next thing I need is an

[07:16:33 - 07:16:37]
example of actual messages so we'll just

[07:16:35 - 07:16:39]
say messages API

[07:16:37 - 07:16:41]
anthropic now I honestly find the

[07:16:39 - 07:16:42]
easiest way to use anthropic is via

[07:16:41 - 07:16:43]
Amazon Bedrock but you know use whatever

[07:16:42 - 07:16:47]
you need to

[07:16:43 - 07:16:49]
use um we'll say python here we'll just

[07:16:47 - 07:16:51]
type this again

[07:16:49 - 07:16:55]
Python and so I'm just trying to find

[07:16:51 - 07:16:57]
that example of it yeah so it's roll and

[07:16:55 - 07:16:58]
content so that is very straightforward

[07:16:57 - 07:17:00]
I'm going to go ahead and just copy that

[07:16:58 - 07:17:02]
from wherever this is here we're going

[07:17:00 - 07:17:03]
to go ahead and give this a paste in

[07:17:02 - 07:17:06]
I'll probably fix this up a little bit

[07:17:03 - 07:17:06]
so it's less of a

[07:17:07 - 07:17:10]
mess

[07:17:12 - 07:17:18]
okay and uh yeah we'll just leave it as

[07:17:16 - 07:17:18]
this and see what

[07:17:19 - 07:17:23]
happens and we'll just zoom out a little

[07:17:22 - 07:17:25]
bit here so we can see what we're doing

[07:17:23 - 07:17:26]
so at least one message is required oh

[07:17:25 - 07:17:28]
you know what we didn't actually

[07:17:26 - 07:17:29]
replace this value here we'll go ahead

[07:17:28 - 07:17:32]
and give that a

[07:17:29 - 07:17:34]
run so there we go so we got a response

[07:17:32 - 07:17:37]
back very very

[07:17:34 - 07:17:39]
straightforward um but yeah nothing

[07:17:37 - 07:17:43]
super exciting here um I know there's

[07:17:39 - 07:17:46]
other capabilities that anthropic uh API

[07:17:43 - 07:17:49]
has but I really don't investigate their

[07:17:46 - 07:17:52]
individual ones because I generally use

[07:17:49 - 07:17:54]
anthropic through vertex AI or um Amazon

[07:17:52 - 07:17:57]
Bedrock but sometimes they'll have

[07:17:54 - 07:17:58]
functionality that is only accessible

[07:17:57 - 07:18:00]
through their API let's go over to their

[07:17:58 - 07:18:02]
API reference

[07:18:00 - 07:18:03]
I'm just looking down here to see if

[07:18:02 - 07:18:04]
there's anything interesting so we have

[07:18:03 - 07:18:06]
messages which is pretty straightforward

[07:18:04 - 07:18:07]
we can stream

[07:18:06 - 07:18:10]
messages

[07:18:07 - 07:18:12]
um we can list models we can do batch

[07:18:10 - 07:18:15]
messaging which I would assume would be

[07:18:12 - 07:18:17]
more cost effective just like open AI

[07:18:15 - 07:18:19]
there's the Legacy one I assume we

[07:18:17 - 07:18:21]
wouldn't use that anymore there is an

[07:18:19 - 07:18:22]
admin API but I can't imagine that

[07:18:21 - 07:18:25]
that's something we'd ever really want

[07:18:22 - 07:18:28]
to uh fiddle with then we have Amazon

[07:18:25 - 07:18:29]
bedrock and vertex AI down below um yeah

[07:18:28 - 07:18:31]
I guess what I was looking for was some

[07:18:29 - 07:18:32]
of those beta featur because there's

[07:18:31 - 07:18:35]
always really interesting things that

[07:18:32 - 07:18:36]
anthropic can do so just say like

[07:18:35 - 07:18:40]
anthropic well actually down below here

[07:18:36 - 07:18:46]
it says ask AI so what are some of the

[07:18:40 - 07:18:48]
beta features via the API I can use with

[07:18:46 - 07:18:49]
anthropic so some always like hearing

[07:18:48 - 07:18:51]
really cool things like being able to

[07:18:49 - 07:18:52]
control your screen and stuff like that

[07:18:51 - 07:18:55]
but where they are they're not clearly

[07:18:52 - 07:18:58]
here in the main API so maybe their uh

[07:18:55 - 07:19:00]
AI uh thing can help us we'll just give

[07:18:58 - 07:19:02]
it a moment here that's the what I'm

[07:19:00 - 07:19:04]
thinking about computer computer use

[07:19:02 - 07:19:06]
beta so allows you to interact with the

[07:19:04 - 07:19:08]
computer desktop comments here's an

[07:19:06 - 07:19:09]
example of the code and we don't

[07:19:08 - 07:19:11]
actually see oh there's the example

[07:19:09 - 07:19:11]
there we

[07:19:12 - 07:19:16]
go and message batching here it's saying

[07:19:15 - 07:19:18]
it's in beta I don't think it's in beta

[07:19:16 - 07:19:21]
anymore um I think it's just part of the

[07:19:18 - 07:19:22]
API now I'm not sure how out of dat it

[07:19:21 - 07:19:24]
is but yeah I mean that's pretty

[07:19:22 - 07:19:27]
straightforward we can go back over to

[07:19:24 - 07:19:29]
the workbench itself um I don't think

[07:19:27 - 07:19:32]
there's anything exciting here to talk

[07:19:29 - 07:19:32]
about in the workbench

[07:19:32 - 07:19:37]
okay yeah yeah yeah so I mean something

[07:19:34 - 07:19:40]
that the API supports I believe is tool

[07:19:37 - 07:19:41]
use so I guess if you wanted to test

[07:19:40 - 07:19:43]
tool use in here that's something that

[07:19:41 - 07:19:44]
you could do which is kind of

[07:19:43 - 07:19:48]
interesting so I guess we have an

[07:19:44 - 07:19:50]
example there um do I want to show tool

[07:19:48 - 07:19:52]
use right now probably not if we do

[07:19:50 - 07:19:53]
something with let's say rag then we

[07:19:52 - 07:19:55]
could come back to that right now I'm

[07:19:53 - 07:19:57]
not that interested in showing off uh

[07:19:55 - 07:19:59]
tool use but yeah there's your your

[07:19:57 - 07:20:02]
basic starting uh starting place with

[07:19:59 - 07:20:04]
anthropic um I'm going to go ahead and

[07:20:02 - 07:20:06]
commit uh this stuff here so just say

[07:20:04 - 07:20:08]
anthropic

[07:20:06 - 07:20:10]
example okay and so you can see it's not

[07:20:08 - 07:20:12]
super complicated the only thing that I

[07:20:10 - 07:20:13]
did not like and I mean I understand why

[07:20:12 - 07:20:17]
they did that but they forc you to put

[07:20:13 - 07:20:18]
in your um Canadian business number um

[07:20:17 - 07:20:20]
for taxes and I suppose you're supposed

[07:20:18 - 07:20:23]
to do that but I like just to fill out

[07:20:20 - 07:20:24]
forms then I had to go ask Boo for the U

[07:20:23 - 07:20:27]
business number I'm going to go and make

[07:20:24 - 07:20:30]
sure I get rid of the API key as I do

[07:20:27 - 07:20:33]
not want to have issues here um we'll go

[07:20:30 - 07:20:35]
ahead and we'll just delete this key and

[07:20:33 - 07:20:39]
now we're in good shape okay

[07:20:35 - 07:20:41]
[Music]

[07:20:39 - 07:20:44]
ciao all right so we looked at sagemaker

[07:20:41 - 07:20:45]
and also Azure ml Studio but let's still

[07:20:44 - 07:20:48]
take take a look and see if we can run

[07:20:45 - 07:20:50]
notebooks in Google Cloud obviously have

[07:20:48 - 07:20:52]
Google Cod lab um but let's see if

[07:20:50 - 07:20:56]
there's something directly in here I

[07:20:52 - 07:20:58]
honestly don't remember um but we'll go

[07:20:56 - 07:20:59]
over to vertex AI because if there was

[07:20:58 - 07:21:00]
one place it would be it would be there

[07:20:59 - 07:21:02]
we could also just type in notebooks at

[07:21:00 - 07:21:03]
the here and see what we get and so we

[07:21:02 - 07:21:06]
have

[07:21:03 - 07:21:07]
workbench um so that might be a way of

[07:21:06 - 07:21:09]
yeah I think that's their their managed

[07:21:07 - 07:21:11]
way of running notebooks it is okay

[07:21:09 - 07:21:13]
great so why they call workbench I don't

[07:21:11 - 07:21:15]
know um but it is one way of doing it I

[07:21:13 - 07:21:17]
already have an existing project here so

[07:21:15 - 07:21:20]
you'd have to create a project I keep

[07:21:17 - 07:21:23]
using my fre frees free BSC and I never

[07:21:20 - 07:21:25]
seem to clean up my projects uh one day

[07:21:23 - 07:21:27]
I will it's just managing projects in

[07:21:25 - 07:21:29]
Google Cloud are kind of a pain compared

[07:21:27 - 07:21:32]
to something like Azure resource groups

[07:21:29 - 07:21:33]
so we've now en it that was really fast

[07:21:32 - 07:21:35]
and we'll go ahead and create a new

[07:21:33 - 07:21:38]
instance we probably should be paying

[07:21:35 - 07:21:42]
attention to the cost so over here it's

[07:21:38 - 07:21:44]
showing us it is um a dollar so that's

[07:21:42 - 07:21:46]
kind of expensive but maybe we can

[07:21:44 - 07:21:50]
choose what we're running underneath

[07:21:46 - 07:21:51]
yeah so here we can see we have um I

[07:21:50 - 07:21:53]
mean these are

[07:21:51 - 07:21:55]
environments and I guess they're just

[07:21:53 - 07:21:56]
kind of pre-built environments for us

[07:21:55 - 07:21:58]
we're not really choosing exactly what

[07:21:56 - 07:22:01]
we want all all environments have the

[07:21:58 - 07:22:05]
latest GPU libraries installed

[07:22:01 - 07:22:06]
okay so we have Debian Ubuntu I mean I I

[07:22:05 - 07:22:08]
like Debian but let's go over here does

[07:22:06 - 07:22:12]
this one become cheaper we switch over

[07:22:08 - 07:22:16]
to that no it does

[07:22:12 - 07:22:20]
not um I'm G to go back over to just

[07:22:16 - 07:22:22]
python with Intel ml mkl what is Intel

[07:22:20 - 07:22:25]
mkl you think I know I know usually

[07:22:22 - 07:22:28]
mostly all the stuff oh math kernel

[07:22:25 - 07:22:30]
Library okay yeah yeah yeah um but you

[07:22:28 - 07:22:32]
know I was hoping that I could choose oh

[07:22:30 - 07:22:33]
here it is okay so down below here we

[07:22:32 - 07:22:36]
have our

[07:22:33 - 07:22:38]
configuration um so C3 was what we were

[07:22:36 - 07:22:41]
trying to launch earlier for something

[07:22:38 - 07:22:45]
um but you see we have a few different

[07:22:41 - 07:22:47]
options um we have AMD Intel

[07:22:45 - 07:22:50]
Skylake I want something that's just

[07:22:47 - 07:22:52]
going to be cost effective so and I only

[07:22:50 - 07:22:54]
want a single VC I don't know let's

[07:22:52 - 07:22:58]
choose N1 is that

[07:22:54 - 07:23:00]
cheaper I just remember Sky being um

[07:22:58 - 07:23:02]
cheaper so I went here and now we're

[07:23:00 - 07:23:05]
getting into something more reasonable

[07:23:02 - 07:23:09]
this is even cheaper than um than uh uh

[07:23:05 - 07:23:11]
ml M3 medium right so we have a lot of

[07:23:09 - 07:23:12]
options here but again I'm not trying to

[07:23:11 - 07:23:14]
run something for real here look like

[07:23:12 - 07:23:15]
look how much memory I have so this

[07:23:14 - 07:23:18]
isn't something that you run a real

[07:23:15 - 07:23:20]
workload on it's just me trying to show

[07:23:18 - 07:23:22]
you how to launch up the notebook okay

[07:23:20 - 07:23:24]
so we have us Central 1 Iowa this is

[07:23:22 - 07:23:25]
totally fine I'm going to go down below

[07:23:24 - 07:23:28]
we're going to go ahead and create this

[07:23:25 - 07:23:31]
all the other settings are fine and we

[07:23:28 - 07:23:32]
will take a look and see what we get

[07:23:31 - 07:23:36]
really happy about that cost though

[07:23:32 - 07:23:38]
that's really good cost um I don't know

[07:23:36 - 07:23:40]
if it has a free tier to be honest here

[07:23:38 - 07:23:42]
it says uh vertex AI workbench user

[07:23:40 - 07:23:44]
manage notebooks is deprecated and and

[07:23:42 - 07:23:47]
will support recommend you migrate to

[07:23:44 - 07:23:49]
the AI workbench

[07:23:47 - 07:23:53]
instances oh is that what we're okay is

[07:23:49 - 07:23:56]
that what not we're using right now the

[07:23:53 - 07:23:59]
instances user manage

[07:23:56 - 07:24:01]
notebooks juper lab 4 is now available

[07:23:59 - 07:24:03]
in this well how do do I know what it

[07:24:01 - 07:24:05]
launched I don't even know what it

[07:24:03 - 07:24:09]
launched manage

[07:24:05 - 07:24:09]
notebooks okay I'll give this a refresh

[07:24:09 - 07:24:13]
here I don't see

[07:24:13 - 07:24:17]
anything I mean I definitely am creating

[07:24:15 - 07:24:21]
one up

[07:24:17 - 07:24:21]
here see all

[07:24:21 - 07:24:26]
activities I got to turn on that MFA

[07:24:24 - 07:24:28]
nobody make fun of me for not having my

[07:24:26 - 07:24:30]
I'll get my MFA turned on don't worry

[07:24:28 - 07:24:33]
before the Boot Camp starts I'll make

[07:24:30 - 07:24:33]
sure my MFA is turned on

[07:24:33 - 07:24:41]
okay but I'm not

[07:24:36 - 07:24:41]
sure is it launching or what's going

[07:24:43 - 07:24:46]
on

[07:24:48 - 07:24:53]
executions

[07:24:50 - 07:24:57]
no that is

[07:24:53 - 07:25:02]
uh I hate that because I can't tell if

[07:24:57 - 07:25:02]
it's installing now or not and

[07:25:02 - 07:25:05]
I don't have any notification that

[07:25:03 - 07:25:08]
suggests other otherwise so I'm this

[07:25:05 - 07:25:08]
another hard

[07:25:11 - 07:25:17]
refresh

[07:25:13 - 07:25:19]
okay and so I'm on instances here right

[07:25:17 - 07:25:20]
like I don't mind launching to I just

[07:25:19 - 07:25:21]
have to pay attention to it so I'm going

[07:25:20 - 07:25:25]
to go ahead and create

[07:25:21 - 07:25:27]
new default default this is fine is this

[07:25:25 - 07:25:29]
experience a little bit

[07:25:27 - 07:25:31]
different oh did it take me to a much

[07:25:29 - 07:25:33]
more

[07:25:31 - 07:25:34]
no not really I'm not sure why this is

[07:25:33 - 07:25:36]
so

[07:25:34 - 07:25:40]
different create

[07:25:36 - 07:25:43]
new I don't want to T T4 no thank you I

[07:25:40 - 07:25:46]
wonder if that's what uh cab uses but

[07:25:43 - 07:25:48]
here we have an ec2 standard for 20

[07:25:46 - 07:25:49]
cents an hour why was the other one

[07:25:48 - 07:25:53]
giving me so many

[07:25:49 - 07:25:56]
options here we go

[07:25:53 - 07:25:58]
instance what does user manage look

[07:25:56 - 07:26:01]
like manage notebook well what did we

[07:25:58 - 07:26:02]
have just a second ago why experience

[07:26:01 - 07:26:04]
completely

[07:26:02 - 07:26:06]
different whatever I'm going to go over

[07:26:04 - 07:26:07]
here on the left hand side I'm going to

[07:26:06 - 07:26:10]
go to instances as that's what it's

[07:26:07 - 07:26:11]
recommending us to do I did create this

[07:26:10 - 07:26:13]
new one I don't even know how to get

[07:26:11 - 07:26:15]
back to that other interface we just had

[07:26:13 - 07:26:18]
that's totally fine and so here it says

[07:26:15 - 07:26:19]
ec2 standard for I'm going to go Advance

[07:26:18 - 07:26:21]
options I just want to see if I have a

[07:26:19 - 07:26:24]
little bit more flexibility to change my

[07:26:21 - 07:26:27]
um machine type and so I'm going to go

[07:26:24 - 07:26:27]
over to

[07:26:27 - 07:26:33]
N1 which is is it any cheaper

[07:26:31 - 07:26:35]
oh it is

[07:26:33 - 07:26:37]
okay but I don't know what happened to

[07:26:35 - 07:26:40]
my uh my other one there and this will

[07:26:37 - 07:26:44]
idle after shut down

[07:26:40 - 07:26:46]
before minutes I'll say range 10 minutes

[07:26:44 - 07:26:48]
I like that that's good I like that so

[07:26:46 - 07:26:50]
we'll go ahead and do that that's like

[07:26:48 - 07:26:53]
the lowest setting I've seen so

[07:26:50 - 07:26:55]
far I think

[07:26:53 - 07:26:57]
anyway but uh yeah I'm not sure what

[07:26:55 - 07:26:59]
happened to that other

[07:26:57 - 07:27:01]
notebook and I thought like in my

[07:26:59 - 07:27:03]
notifications it would show up here I

[07:27:01 - 07:27:03]
guess

[07:27:04 - 07:27:10]
not again just still clicking around

[07:27:08 - 07:27:12]
here yeah nope I don't know what

[07:27:10 - 07:27:14]
happened to the other one I'm sure in a

[07:27:12 - 07:27:17]
month B's gonna be like hey

[07:27:14 - 07:27:18]
Andrew you spun up something that has

[07:27:17 - 07:27:20]
cost down here we also have collab

[07:27:18 - 07:27:21]
Enterprise which I'm not obviously going

[07:27:20 - 07:27:25]
to use I'm not an

[07:27:21 - 07:27:27]
Enterprise but um yeah I guess they have

[07:27:25 - 07:27:30]
that as well but we'll stick over stick

[07:27:27 - 07:27:32]
stick with workbench here

[07:27:30 - 07:27:37]
and we'll just wait for that to become

[07:27:32 - 07:27:37]
available uh yeah so we click into

[07:27:37 - 07:27:41]
it yeah we're just waiting for it to

[07:27:39 - 07:27:44]
start I guess okay so we'll hold on

[07:27:41 - 07:27:47]
tight all right so um yeah it's up now I

[07:27:44 - 07:27:48]
had to refresh um as sometimes you have

[07:27:47 - 07:27:50]
to do let's go ahead and open up Jupiter

[07:27:48 - 07:27:53]
lab

[07:27:50 - 07:27:56]
here okay we'll just give it a

[07:27:53 - 07:27:58]
moment nice little Google Cloud

[07:27:56 - 07:28:01]
logo and here we are the experience is

[07:27:58 - 07:28:03]
obviously a little bit different

[07:28:01 - 07:28:05]
um I don't recognize some of these here

[07:28:03 - 07:28:07]
notebook executor so it looks like they

[07:28:05 - 07:28:08]
have a little bit uh little bit

[07:28:07 - 07:28:10]
differences

[07:28:08 - 07:28:14]
here we have a little nice notebook

[07:28:10 - 07:28:15]
template here um yeah some some things

[07:28:14 - 07:28:17]
here I'm just stick with the regular

[07:28:15 - 07:28:20]
python for now I'm going to go ahead

[07:28:17 - 07:28:21]
back to the launcher we'll choose Python

[07:28:20 - 07:28:24]
3 IP

[07:28:21 - 07:28:28]
kernel we'll do our usual pip install

[07:28:24 - 07:28:28]
Transformers nothing exciting here

[07:28:33 - 07:28:38]
okay all right I guess we modify the

[07:28:36 - 07:28:40]
hardware here so yeah it kind of reminds

[07:28:38 - 07:28:42]
me of like uh stage maker stage maker

[07:28:40 - 07:28:43]
Studio Classic in that there's a few

[07:28:42 - 07:28:45]
more little Integrations um I actually

[07:28:43 - 07:28:47]
prefer stage maker Studio Classic as

[07:28:45 - 07:28:50]
opposed to the new stage merro Studio

[07:28:47 - 07:28:51]
but any of us wanted to change it so

[07:28:50 - 07:28:52]
yeah we installed it there and so now we

[07:28:51 - 07:28:54]
have another environment that we can

[07:28:52 - 07:28:55]
work in so if you did not know that you

[07:28:54 - 07:28:58]
can do that I'm going to go ahead and

[07:28:55 - 07:29:01]
delete that here today and so that is

[07:28:58 - 07:29:03]
another place where we can use

[07:29:01 - 07:29:07]
uh notebooks in the cloud

[07:29:03 - 07:29:09]
[Music]

[07:29:07 - 07:29:10]
okay all right in this video I want to

[07:29:09 - 07:29:12]
take a look at coh here and so I'm going

[07:29:10 - 07:29:13]
to go ahead and sign into coh here what

[07:29:12 - 07:29:15]
I really like about coh here is that

[07:29:13 - 07:29:17]
they have a very generous free tier so

[07:29:15 - 07:29:18]
you can get started with them uh very

[07:29:17 - 07:29:20]
quickly and I've already created an

[07:29:18 - 07:29:22]
account before so I'm just connecting

[07:29:20 - 07:29:24]
here and so now I'm in my account

[07:29:22 - 07:29:26]
obviously we could attach bilding and

[07:29:24 - 07:29:29]
usage here I do not plan on doing that

[07:29:26 - 07:29:31]
here today unless I need to do so we're

[07:29:29 - 07:29:34]
going to make our way over to the API

[07:29:31 - 07:29:38]
keys and you can see I already have a uh

[07:29:34 - 07:29:39]
a key generated from prior I think I'm

[07:29:38 - 07:29:41]
still using this key so I'm going to

[07:29:39 - 07:29:43]
actually leave it around as um I have

[07:29:41 - 07:29:45]
somebody building something out for our

[07:29:43 - 07:29:47]
boot camp with it but I'm going to go

[07:29:45 - 07:29:49]
over to GitHub geni Essentials and I

[07:29:47 - 07:29:51]
might already have an environment

[07:29:49 - 07:29:53]
already running here um so I do so I'm

[07:29:51 - 07:29:55]
going to go ahead and just open that in

[07:29:53 - 07:29:57]
the browser of course if you do not then

[07:29:55 - 07:29:58]
you will have to launch one and get Hub

[07:29:57 - 07:30:01]
code spaces or use whatever you like

[07:29:58 - 07:30:03]
here today and I'm going to create a new

[07:30:01 - 07:30:06]
trial key um and so this will just be

[07:30:03 - 07:30:07]
example key and so we'll go ahead and

[07:30:06 - 07:30:11]
generate out that key there and so now

[07:30:07 - 07:30:12]
we have our example key um which I think

[07:30:11 - 07:30:14]
we can look at at any time so that's

[07:30:12 - 07:30:17]
totally fine um and so we're getting

[07:30:14 - 07:30:19]
this environment spun up here but yeah

[07:30:17 - 07:30:21]
coh here has its own playground so you

[07:30:19 - 07:30:23]
go over to here and they have a

[07:30:21 - 07:30:26]
playground um so we have chat classify

[07:30:23 - 07:30:28]
in bed uh and generate which you do not

[07:30:26 - 07:30:30]
use anymore but I like their playground

[07:30:28 - 07:30:31]
because it really does give you a lot of

[07:30:30 - 07:30:34]
quick examples very quickly on how you

[07:30:31 - 07:30:36]
can uh utilize it on the right hand side

[07:30:34 - 07:30:38]
you can see they have tool use um they

[07:30:36 - 07:30:41]
have connections to other or connectors

[07:30:38 - 07:30:43]
to other um things like doing web search

[07:30:41 - 07:30:46]
which is very nice you can provide it

[07:30:43 - 07:30:48]
the response format um so that you can

[07:30:46 - 07:30:52]
get back structured Json if you Pro

[07:30:48 - 07:30:54]
provide a uh Json schema file um so yeah

[07:30:52 - 07:30:55]
there's a lot of stuff that can be done

[07:30:54 - 07:30:57]
here but I again just want to show you

[07:30:55 - 07:30:59]
how to work with this programmatically

[07:30:57 - 07:31:01]
very quickly um so if our environment is

[07:30:59 - 07:31:03]
spun up which it is I'm going to make a

[07:31:01 - 07:31:07]
new folder over here and we're going to

[07:31:03 - 07:31:09]
call this one CLA uh or not CLA C here I

[07:31:07 - 07:31:12]
apologize and we'll go ahead and we'll

[07:31:09 - 07:31:14]
make a new file here called basic. iynb

[07:31:12 - 07:31:18]
and I'm going to make a newv file here

[07:31:14 - 07:31:20]
called EnV and then I'll make aemv

[07:31:18 - 07:31:24]
example and then we'll make another one

[07:31:20 - 07:31:26]
here called Dog ignore in the doget

[07:31:24 - 07:31:28]
ignore I want to ignore. EnV so we'll go

[07:31:26 - 07:31:30]
ahead and do that if I have yet to do so

[07:31:28 - 07:31:32]
did I commit the stuff from last time I

[07:31:30 - 07:31:34]
did but we'll go over to here we'll add

[07:31:32 - 07:31:36]
some code I'm going to assume that pip

[07:31:34 - 07:31:39]
install CO here so I'm going to go and

[07:31:36 - 07:31:43]
say install uh I'm going to do hyphen Q

[07:31:39 - 07:31:44]
Co here we'll also want python. EnV um

[07:31:43 - 07:31:46]
I'm going to want to make sure that's a

[07:31:44 - 07:31:50]
percentage I'm going to make sure that I

[07:31:46 - 07:31:53]
want to uh bring in from this one um

[07:31:50 - 07:31:56]
this here so I'm going copy this over as

[07:31:53 - 07:31:58]
we want to import the EnV into our file

[07:31:56 - 07:32:02]
here and so now I just need some coher

[07:31:58 - 07:32:03]
code so if I go to chat I wonder if they

[07:32:02 - 07:32:05]
have yep they have code up here in the

[07:32:03 - 07:32:07]
top right corner we're going to go ahead

[07:32:05 - 07:32:09]
and grab this example and I'm going to

[07:32:07 - 07:32:12]
go back over to here I'm going to paste

[07:32:09 - 07:32:14]
it in I need to grab my API key from

[07:32:12 - 07:32:17]
here so I'm going to go ahead and copy

[07:32:14 - 07:32:18]
it I click the copy button and it looks

[07:32:17 - 07:32:21]
like it's not saying what it's supposed

[07:32:18 - 07:32:22]
to be so we could just hardcode a value

[07:32:21 - 07:32:24]
here I'm going to go ahead and paste

[07:32:22 - 07:32:27]
this in and it's going to be called my

[07:32:24 - 07:32:28]
coh here API key and that's what I'm

[07:32:27 - 07:32:29]
going to call it I'm not sure if that's

[07:32:28 - 07:32:32]
if that's what it's supposed to be

[07:32:29 - 07:32:33]
implicit L called sometimes we can look

[07:32:32 - 07:32:35]
that up I don't always care to look it

[07:32:33 - 07:32:37]
up and so in here they're saying this is

[07:32:35 - 07:32:40]
where you load your key so we going to

[07:32:37 - 07:32:43]
do OS uh Environ so I'm going have to

[07:32:40 - 07:32:46]
also include in here import OS um but

[07:32:43 - 07:32:50]
we'll say OS

[07:32:46 - 07:32:52]
Environ doget this will be coh here API

[07:32:50 - 07:32:54]
key so that will bring that over here

[07:32:52 - 07:32:56]
obviously it wants us to have a message

[07:32:54 - 07:32:57]
here this is set up for streaming which

[07:32:56 - 07:32:59]
is fine there's nothing wrong with

[07:32:57 - 07:33:01]
streaming we can absolutely do that it

[07:32:59 - 07:33:02]
looks like we already have some chat

[07:33:01 - 07:33:04]
history in here so I'm going to go ahead

[07:33:02 - 07:33:05]
and bring this on down a little bit I'm

[07:33:04 - 07:33:07]
not sure if this is their

[07:33:05 - 07:33:11]
older

[07:33:07 - 07:33:12]
um their older uh API because I'm pretty

[07:33:11 - 07:33:13]
sure that they

[07:33:12 - 07:33:17]
standardized

[07:33:13 - 07:33:18]
on uh utilizing uh like there's a newer

[07:33:17 - 07:33:20]
format so I'm going to go ahead and say

[07:33:18 - 07:33:23]
coh here API because that kind of looks

[07:33:20 - 07:33:26]
a little bit old to

[07:33:23 - 07:33:28]
me right and if I go to their docs just

[07:33:26 - 07:33:32]
want some examples API

[07:33:28 - 07:33:35]
reference see it says chat version

[07:33:32 - 07:33:37]
two right so I go here and notice it

[07:33:35 - 07:33:38]
says messages so this is really what we

[07:33:37 - 07:33:40]
want I mean we can obviously do

[07:33:38 - 07:33:43]
streaming but this is actually what we

[07:33:40 - 07:33:45]
want because I think that um uh maybe in

[07:33:43 - 07:33:47]
their in their portal it's a little bit

[07:33:45 - 07:33:48]
out of date which is totally fine also

[07:33:47 - 07:33:50]
looks like we have some variants here if

[07:33:48 - 07:33:52]
we're trying to do different things like

[07:33:50 - 07:33:53]
documents or tool use the documents

[07:33:52 - 07:33:55]
documentation is really really good uh

[07:33:53 - 07:33:56]
for this platform and we're going to go

[07:33:55 - 07:33:58]
over here I'm just going to replace this

[07:33:56 - 07:34:00]
with this version this using command r+

[07:33:58 - 07:34:03]
which is totally fine it already has

[07:34:00 - 07:34:06]
information for us in here um I don't

[07:34:03 - 07:34:08]
know what it uses as a default to load

[07:34:06 - 07:34:10]
the environment variable so I'm just

[07:34:08 - 07:34:14]
kind of looking for that

[07:34:10 - 07:34:17]
here just a moment sorry B was asking me

[07:34:14 - 07:34:19]
for my uh um baser he's making a turkey

[07:34:17 - 07:34:22]
but anyway I'm back um and so yeah

[07:34:19 - 07:34:25]
somewhere in here there must be an

[07:34:22 - 07:34:28]
indicator in terms of what the nvar is

[07:34:25 - 07:34:31]
for it so just look up uh coh

[07:34:28 - 07:34:33]
here nvar

[07:34:31 - 07:34:35]
because maybe there is one I mean

[07:34:33 - 07:34:36]
there's is calling it that so maybe I

[07:34:35 - 07:34:38]
have guessed correctly and it will

[07:34:36 - 07:34:41]
actually automatically load that one in

[07:34:38 - 07:34:44]
so I'm just going to assume that that is

[07:34:41 - 07:34:46]
correct um and we'll go ahead we'll just

[07:34:44 - 07:34:46]
run

[07:34:48 - 07:34:52]
this and then we'll run the next one

[07:34:50 - 07:34:56]
here and then we'll run the next one

[07:34:52 - 07:34:59]
here and so we do get an output

[07:34:56 - 07:35:01]
um yep and we get a response so there

[07:34:59 - 07:35:03]
like a little bit more work that we'd

[07:35:01 - 07:35:04]
have to do to format this response but

[07:35:03 - 07:35:07]
yeah that's as simple as it is working

[07:35:04 - 07:35:08]
with the coh here API and again it has a

[07:35:07 - 07:35:09]
generous free tier which is really nice

[07:35:08 - 07:35:11]
I'm going to go ahead and delete our

[07:35:09 - 07:35:13]
example key as I do not need it any

[07:35:11 - 07:35:16]
longer I'm going to go ahead we're going

[07:35:13 - 07:35:18]
to add this here just say coh here API

[07:35:16 - 07:35:21]
and so yeah that would be a very good um

[07:35:18 - 07:35:23]
one that to utilize if again you have no

[07:35:21 - 07:35:24]
spend this one is very generous the

[07:35:23 - 07:35:27]
other thing is that their models you can

[07:35:24 - 07:35:28]
also download them from hugging face so

[07:35:27 - 07:35:29]
they have them in another format I'm not

[07:35:28 - 07:35:31]
sure if they're I wouldn't call them

[07:35:29 - 07:35:35]
open source but they're open openly

[07:35:31 - 07:35:36]
available to utilize for locally so I

[07:35:35 - 07:35:38]
don't think there are limits based on

[07:35:36 - 07:35:39]
that you can use as much as you want but

[07:35:38 - 07:35:41]
obviously for commercial use it' be

[07:35:39 - 07:35:44]
different story so it's nice that you

[07:35:41 - 07:35:47]
can have a model that that you could use

[07:35:44 - 07:35:49]
serverly or download and and utilize it

[07:35:47 - 07:35:51]
as much as you need to until you need to

[07:35:49 - 07:35:54]
put into production but there you

[07:35:51 - 07:35:57]
[Music]

[07:35:54 - 07:35:59]
go all right let's take a look at AI 21

[07:35:57 - 07:36:02]
uh so a21 is known for models that have

[07:35:59 - 07:36:05]
much longer contexts uh than other other

[07:36:02 - 07:36:06]
ones so if you need a lot of text like

[07:36:05 - 07:36:08]
large documents that's where this one

[07:36:06 - 07:36:11]
can come into play and it can be very

[07:36:08 - 07:36:14]
very useful um but let's go ahead and

[07:36:11 - 07:36:15]
see what we can figure out here I

[07:36:14 - 07:36:18]
believe that they do have some kind of

[07:36:15 - 07:36:20]
playground here in API um but we have

[07:36:18 - 07:36:21]
chat with Jamba or build with Jamba

[07:36:20 - 07:36:24]
actually I don't know we could chat with

[07:36:21 - 07:36:26]
it let's go over to here and I guess

[07:36:24 - 07:36:29]
they also have a chat environment just

[07:36:26 - 07:36:31]
like any other one so we'll go over here

[07:36:29 - 07:36:31]
and take a look

[07:36:31 - 07:36:34]
we'll say

[07:36:37 - 07:36:44]
continue and so now we are in Jamba chat

[07:36:40 - 07:36:44]
I can just say hello how are

[07:36:45 - 07:36:50]
you okay it says hello I'm doing well

[07:36:48 - 07:36:52]
how can assist you today so it would be

[07:36:50 - 07:36:54]
really interesting to see how this one

[07:36:52 - 07:36:55]
would perform against other AI powered

[07:36:54 - 07:36:57]
assistants but I don't think this is

[07:36:55 - 07:36:58]
intended as an AI powered assistant this

[07:36:57 - 07:37:00]
is more just a demonstration of what

[07:36:58 - 07:37:02]
this thing can do let's go over to start

[07:37:00 - 07:37:06]
building as this is really what I'm

[07:37:02 - 07:37:07]
interested in and so now we have uh this

[07:37:06 - 07:37:09]
is the playground so we have chat

[07:37:07 - 07:37:11]
conversational rag rag engine and so I

[07:37:09 - 07:37:13]
could see how this could be really good

[07:37:11 - 07:37:15]
for um large large code bases let's go

[07:37:13 - 07:37:17]
over to view code and so we have some

[07:37:15 - 07:37:19]
code here and as per usual we're going

[07:37:17 - 07:37:21]
to go over to GitHub and I'm going to

[07:37:19 - 07:37:23]
make my way over to Jing Essentials and

[07:37:21 - 07:37:26]
I'm going to go ahead and

[07:37:23 - 07:37:28]
open this in the browser okay and we'll

[07:37:26 - 07:37:30]
just give that just a moment and so that

[07:37:28 - 07:37:32]
is now open opening I've had this

[07:37:30 - 07:37:34]
environment open from previous videos

[07:37:32 - 07:37:35]
but of course there's nothing special

[07:37:34 - 07:37:38]
that we're doing here that is out of the

[07:37:35 - 07:37:40]
ordinary um yeah it looks like we have a

[07:37:38 - 07:37:43]
JavaScript curl option but mostly it's

[07:37:40 - 07:37:47]
python so we'll go over here and we will

[07:37:43 - 07:37:51]
give AI 21 Labs a try here so say AI

[07:37:47 - 07:37:53]
21 uh AI 21

[07:37:51 - 07:37:55]
labs and we'll go ahead and make a new

[07:37:53 - 07:37:59]
file here called basic.

[07:37:55 - 07:38:02]
iynb and in here we'll add couple new

[07:37:59 - 07:38:06]
code blocks here I'm going to

[07:38:02 - 07:38:08]
grab these here and we'll bring them on

[07:38:06 - 07:38:09]
over and I'm just going to bring this

[07:38:08 - 07:38:12]
one up into its own I like to do the

[07:38:09 - 07:38:13]
import separately if I can and we're

[07:38:12 - 07:38:15]
going to want our pip install I'm going

[07:38:13 - 07:38:21]
to do hyphen q and we're going to bring

[07:38:15 - 07:38:21]
in AI 21 and also python.

[07:38:21 - 07:38:26]
EnV and from our previous examples I'm

[07:38:24 - 07:38:28]
just going to split here and go to maybe

[07:38:26 - 07:38:30]
our coh here example where we've loaded

[07:38:28 - 07:38:34]
our Imports here I'm going to go

[07:38:30 - 07:38:35]
ahead and bring this on down as such

[07:38:34 - 07:38:37]
maybe take that one out might not even

[07:38:35 - 07:38:40]
use the

[07:38:37 - 07:38:42]
um uh the import OS but that's totally

[07:38:40 - 07:38:44]
fine let's go ahead and give that an

[07:38:42 - 07:38:45]
install and it looks like we're going to

[07:38:44 - 07:38:48]
need a key so I'm going to go ahead here

[07:38:45 - 07:38:50]
and make a newv file and we'll make a

[07:38:48 - 07:38:55]
newv example

[07:38:50 - 07:38:55]
file and we'll make a newg ignore

[07:38:55 - 07:38:58]
file and I think I spelled that right

[07:38:57 - 07:39:01]
we're going to ignore the file I'm going

[07:38:58 - 07:39:03]
to go over to here um sorry back to

[07:39:01 - 07:39:05]
basic and I like how it shows us exactly

[07:39:03 - 07:39:07]
what the key is supposed to be called

[07:39:05 - 07:39:09]
not everybody does that but for this one

[07:39:07 - 07:39:10]
it does it makes my life a lot easier so

[07:39:09 - 07:39:12]
clearly we're going to need a key so

[07:39:10 - 07:39:14]
let's go back over to AI 21 and let's

[07:39:12 - 07:39:16]
see if we can find a key let's go over

[07:39:14 - 07:39:18]
to settings to API Keys it looks like we

[07:39:16 - 07:39:20]
already have a key which is interesting

[07:39:18 - 07:39:21]
because I don't remember generating one

[07:39:20 - 07:39:24]
but we'll go ahead and regenerate it

[07:39:21 - 07:39:26]
maybe they give you one by

[07:39:24 - 07:39:27]
default okay but where where's the key

[07:39:26 - 07:39:29]
how do I get the key do not share your

[07:39:27 - 07:39:30]
key with others or expose it in the

[07:39:29 - 07:39:33]
browser or client in order to protect

[07:39:30 - 07:39:37]
Securities uh view the usage of the key

[07:39:33 - 07:39:40]
okay how do I use the key though where

[07:39:37 - 07:39:46]
do I get the key okay so AI

[07:39:40 - 07:39:46]
21 how do I access the

[07:39:52 - 07:39:59]
key oh you know what I bet it's copied

[07:39:54 - 07:40:01]
it to my clipboard let me see nope

[07:39:59 - 07:40:03]
I tell me like when I press this are you

[07:40:01 - 07:40:08]
sure yes let's rotate it

[07:40:03 - 07:40:11]
out okay oh it's over here copy that is

[07:40:08 - 07:40:12]
not easy to see whoever did the UI on

[07:40:11 - 07:40:16]
that needs

[07:40:12 - 07:40:18]
a needs needs a yeah they need

[07:40:16 - 07:40:20]
to they need to not do that so we can

[07:40:18 - 07:40:21]
load it this way that's totally fine um

[07:40:20 - 07:40:23]
we probably could take it out and we

[07:40:21 - 07:40:26]
probably still load it here it's using

[07:40:23 - 07:40:27]
Jamba Jamba 1.5 large I'm not sure what

[07:40:26 - 07:40:29]
their latest one is we'll go over and

[07:40:27 - 07:40:32]
say uh AI

[07:40:29 - 07:40:32]
21

[07:40:33 - 07:40:37]
models because there is yeah there's

[07:40:35 - 07:40:40]
like a isn't there like a newer one

[07:40:37 - 07:40:40]
let's go over to pricing

[07:40:41 - 07:40:45]
here no I guess we just have mini and

[07:40:43 - 07:40:48]
1.5

[07:40:45 - 07:40:50]
large which is fine let's go back over

[07:40:48 - 07:40:53]
to

[07:40:50 - 07:40:54]
here so we have this one here we have a

[07:40:53 - 07:40:57]
bunch of stuff in here like I don't plan

[07:40:54 - 07:40:59]
on putting documents or tools here we're

[07:40:57 - 07:41:01]
just testing the messaging formatting

[07:40:59 - 07:41:02]
which is very boring also we we're not

[07:41:01 - 07:41:04]
printing anything out here so I assume

[07:41:02 - 07:41:06]
that we need to print back a response so

[07:41:04 - 07:41:10]
I'm going to go ahead here and just say

[07:41:06 - 07:41:11]
response and just say print response um

[07:41:10 - 07:41:12]
and then we're going to need some

[07:41:11 - 07:41:13]
messages in here so I'm going to go and

[07:41:12 - 07:41:15]
say

[07:41:13 - 07:41:17]
messages and I don't not know what

[07:41:15 - 07:41:19]
format it wants but let's just assume it

[07:41:17 - 07:41:20]
wants the usual roll content so we'll

[07:41:19 - 07:41:25]
say

[07:41:20 - 07:41:25]
roll user and then we'll say

[07:41:25 - 07:41:30]
content

[07:41:27 - 07:41:31]
hello how are you

[07:41:30 - 07:41:34]
okay and we'll go down here and then

[07:41:31 - 07:41:36]
we'll go and paste it in as

[07:41:34 - 07:41:37]
such right and so now let's go ahead and

[07:41:36 - 07:41:40]
see if we can grun this stuff so we'll

[07:41:37 - 07:41:43]
do this one and then this

[07:41:40 - 07:41:46]
one and then we'll do this one we get an

[07:41:43 - 07:41:48]
error back it says object has no

[07:41:46 - 07:41:50]
attribute model

[07:41:48 - 07:41:54]
dump and here it's talking about pantic

[07:41:50 - 07:41:55]
version two I mean I don't know if I

[07:41:54 - 07:41:57]
need to specify exactly what response

[07:41:55 - 07:41:59]
format I oh well first of all did we

[07:41:57 - 07:42:01]
even place this in the messages we did

[07:41:59 - 07:42:03]
do that but I don't plan on using

[07:42:01 - 07:42:06]
documents or tools I don't plan on

[07:42:03 - 07:42:09]
having to stop here um everything else

[07:42:06 - 07:42:09]
is fine let's try this

[07:42:10 - 07:42:15]
again object has no attribute model dump

[07:42:12 - 07:42:17]
so it does not like our messages so I

[07:42:15 - 07:42:20]
need to

[07:42:17 - 07:42:21]
find some example code we'll go over to

[07:42:20 - 07:42:24]
documentation

[07:42:21 - 07:42:27]
here we'll say get

[07:42:24 - 07:42:30]
started and let's see if we can quickly

[07:42:27 - 07:42:33]
find an example

[07:42:30 - 07:42:33]
with the

[07:42:33 - 07:42:36]
API so yeah so

[07:42:36 - 07:42:42]
far not seeing it but python s let's go

[07:42:40 - 07:42:44]
down to

[07:42:42 - 07:42:47]
here

[07:42:44 - 07:42:49]
okay uh so it needs to be in a very

[07:42:47 - 07:42:51]
particular user message format I've seen

[07:42:49 - 07:42:53]
this with a few apis not all of them but

[07:42:51 - 07:42:54]
some of them do this where it's

[07:42:53 - 07:42:55]
structured and I guess maybe that's what

[07:42:54 - 07:42:58]
it was talking about when it was talking

[07:42:55 - 07:43:01]
about pantic so let's go back over to

[07:42:58 - 07:43:03]
here and and it looks like that's

[07:43:01 - 07:43:05]
already being no it says chat message

[07:43:03 - 07:43:07]
but we have user message so I almost

[07:43:05 - 07:43:08]
kind of wonder if like this stuff is

[07:43:07 - 07:43:12]
older so I'm going to go ahead here and

[07:43:08 - 07:43:13]
just do this I'm not sure why uh there's

[07:43:12 - 07:43:15]
inconsistencies with the doc but

[07:43:13 - 07:43:17]
sometimes these companies do not have

[07:43:15 - 07:43:18]
time to go and update their docs which

[07:43:17 - 07:43:23]
is not a good idea but it's just what

[07:43:18 - 07:43:25]
happens and so here we have um messages

[07:43:23 - 07:43:28]
I'll just go ahead and copy

[07:43:25 - 07:43:29]
that okay and so yeah it's doing some of

[07:43:28 - 07:43:31]
the formatting for us here let's go

[07:43:29 - 07:43:35]
ahead and run this well first we'll run

[07:43:31 - 07:43:35]
this then we'll run

[07:43:35 - 07:43:39]
this and now we get a

[07:43:37 - 07:43:42]
response okay so that is a way that we

[07:43:39 - 07:43:43]
can start working with AI 21 I we

[07:43:42 - 07:43:46]
obviously haven't covered the advantages

[07:43:43 - 07:43:47]
of AI 21 but this is just to show you

[07:43:46 - 07:43:50]
how that you can start to get working

[07:43:47 - 07:43:51]
with a21 but as far as I understand

[07:43:50 - 07:43:54]
their big pitch was the fact that

[07:43:51 - 07:43:57]
they're they have giant context windows

[07:43:54 - 07:43:59]
so if you have very large documents um

[07:43:57 - 07:44:01]
then this could be a model that might

[07:43:59 - 07:44:02]
perform very well under that we'll go

[07:44:01 - 07:44:06]
ahead and just commit our code so we'll

[07:44:02 - 07:44:08]
just say ai2 and we'll consider this one

[07:44:06 - 07:44:09]
done and I will see you in the next one

[07:44:08 - 07:44:12]
okay

[07:44:09 - 07:44:14]
[Music]

[07:44:12 - 07:44:16]
ciao hey this is Andrew Brown in this

[07:44:14 - 07:44:18]
video I want to give you an introduction

[07:44:16 - 07:44:20]
into Amazon Bedrock so Amazon Bedrock is

[07:44:18 - 07:44:23]
a models of service or it's a collection

[07:44:20 - 07:44:25]
of uh things that you can do uh with

[07:44:23 - 07:44:26]
llms and things like that and we're

[07:44:25 - 07:44:29]
going to go through the most basic

[07:44:26 - 07:44:31]
things basically learning how to uh

[07:44:29 - 07:44:32]
start using it deploying a model things

[07:44:31 - 07:44:35]
like that so I'm going to go over to

[07:44:32 - 07:44:37]
Amazon Bedrock um and then once this is

[07:44:35 - 07:44:39]
loaded on the left hand side we have a

[07:44:37 - 07:44:42]
lot of options now I've already um

[07:44:39 - 07:44:43]
utilized this within North Virginia

[07:44:42 - 07:44:45]
region so when I go over here to the

[07:44:43 - 07:44:47]
model catalog which is all of our

[07:44:45 - 07:44:49]
possible um models I already have a

[07:44:47 - 07:44:51]
bunch activated but if you are doing

[07:44:49 - 07:44:52]
this for the first time you got to go

[07:44:51 - 07:44:55]
all the way down the ground here go to

[07:44:52 - 07:44:57]
model access and you want to modify your

[07:44:55 - 07:44:59]
model access now you might see an option

[07:44:57 - 07:45:00]
here that says uh grant me all model

[07:44:59 - 07:45:02]
access and I'll show you what I mean if

[07:45:00 - 07:45:04]
I switch over to a region that I know I

[07:45:02 - 07:45:07]
have not deployed this in like uh Europe

[07:45:04 - 07:45:11]
Ireland if I have access to this we'll

[07:45:07 - 07:45:12]
see um and I don't have yeah there we go

[07:45:11 - 07:45:14]
so I say enable all model access so

[07:45:12 - 07:45:17]
that's what you want to do and just go

[07:45:14 - 07:45:19]
ahead and proceed to all some options

[07:45:17 - 07:45:22]
might require you to fill in some

[07:45:19 - 07:45:25]
information some models make may take

[07:45:22 - 07:45:28]
time to get access to it so it's best

[07:45:25 - 07:45:30]
for you to do this as soon as you can um

[07:45:28 - 07:45:32]
but anyway you can see I have most model

[07:45:30 - 07:45:33]
model access here and so if I wanted to

[07:45:32 - 07:45:35]
modify my model access I could just

[07:45:33 - 07:45:37]
checkbox on things here but I try to get

[07:45:35 - 07:45:39]
access to as much as I can just because

[07:45:37 - 07:45:41]
it makes my life easy and basically

[07:45:39 - 07:45:43]
everybody that uses uh Amazon medrock

[07:45:41 - 07:45:45]
basically does this approach um looks

[07:45:43 - 07:45:46]
like there's been some changes here I

[07:45:45 - 07:45:48]
like how they said fine tuning

[07:45:46 - 07:45:50]
distribution because custom models was

[07:45:48 - 07:45:51]
not clear before which is fine but

[07:45:50 - 07:45:53]
anyway so I have a lot of models here

[07:45:51 - 07:45:54]
and if I want to start working with them

[07:45:53 - 07:45:57]
I can work in the playground so the

[07:45:54 - 07:45:58]
playground uh also known as a workbench

[07:45:57 - 07:46:00]
depending on what provider you utilize

[07:45:58 - 07:46:02]
is a place where you can start working

[07:46:00 - 07:46:04]
with these models and so here I can go

[07:46:02 - 07:46:06]
ahead and select a model but before I do

[07:46:04 - 07:46:07]
that notice I have two options here chat

[07:46:06 - 07:46:09]
and single prompt if you're using

[07:46:07 - 07:46:11]
something like Azure AI Studio they'll

[07:46:09 - 07:46:13]
be called chat and chat completion on

[07:46:11 - 07:46:16]
Amazon Bedrock it is called chat and

[07:46:13 - 07:46:17]
single prompt and so um when we want to

[07:46:16 - 07:46:19]
have a conversation we'll use chat and

[07:46:17 - 07:46:21]
when we want to just have a single term

[07:46:19 - 07:46:23]
response we'll go and use that one but

[07:46:21 - 07:46:26]
in here on the leth hand side we have a

[07:46:23 - 07:46:29]
bunch of options and so we have um a121

[07:46:26 - 07:46:32]
Labs Amazon anthropic C here meta mistal

[07:46:29 - 07:46:34]
there are some other models um that

[07:46:32 - 07:46:36]
should be here I don't see them in the

[07:46:34 - 07:46:39]
categories but maybe we'd have to deploy

[07:46:36 - 07:46:42]
them and then infer them another

[07:46:39 - 07:46:45]
way but uh you know here are all the new

[07:46:42 - 07:46:47]
models I think that Amazon models are

[07:46:45 - 07:46:49]
under the free tier um but honestly a

[07:46:47 - 07:46:50]
lot of these things are in the penni so

[07:46:49 - 07:46:52]
I I go and take a look here and say

[07:46:50 - 07:46:55]
Amazon Bedrock

[07:46:52 - 07:46:57]
pricing okay and we go down to our

[07:46:55 - 07:46:59]
generative AI

[07:46:57 - 07:47:03]
pricing you can see a lot these models

[07:46:59 - 07:47:05]
it's like 002 008 so you need to utilize

[07:47:03 - 07:47:08]
quite a bit and this is priced per 1,000

[07:47:05 - 07:47:10]
tokens so quite a bit before you are

[07:47:08 - 07:47:13]
seeing uh super spend so you do have to

[07:47:10 - 07:47:16]
have some spend um but you know I think

[07:47:13 - 07:47:19]
that again Amazon Bedrock might uh

[07:47:16 - 07:47:21]
Amazon models might have some free tier

[07:47:19 - 07:47:23]
um but where that is I don't know and it

[07:47:21 - 07:47:26]
probably be on the titanex express okay

[07:47:23 - 07:47:28]
so just understand it's very hard to get

[07:47:26 - 07:47:30]
around those costs and even if you had

[07:47:28 - 07:47:32]
credit from ads there's no way to get

[07:47:30 - 07:47:34]
around this stuff so um just understand

[07:47:32 - 07:47:36]
that you are going to have some spend on

[07:47:34 - 07:47:39]
ads and probably as you're in gcp when

[07:47:36 - 07:47:41]
using model as a service but notice that

[07:47:39 - 07:47:42]
the uh the building is inputs and

[07:47:41 - 07:47:44]
outputs um which is a little bit

[07:47:42 - 07:47:46]
different from other providers but I

[07:47:44 - 07:47:47]
know that there are other models in here

[07:47:46 - 07:47:51]
that I couldn't select from so I know

[07:47:47 - 07:47:52]
that IBM has granite and so I believe

[07:47:51 - 07:47:55]
that that would have to be deployed from

[07:47:52 - 07:47:57]
the marketplace but for now we'll go

[07:47:55 - 07:47:59]
with the things that we can utilize so I

[07:47:57 - 07:48:02]
to select a model and I'm going to go to

[07:47:59 - 07:48:04]
Amazon and we're going to use the Nova

[07:48:02 - 07:48:08]
light and so notice we have the option

[07:48:04 - 07:48:12]
on demand so if we click around we might

[07:48:08 - 07:48:15]
see more than one option okay so we have

[07:48:12 - 07:48:15]
inference

[07:48:16 - 07:48:20]
here and uh you know before what would

[07:48:18 - 07:48:21]
happen is you'd have on demand and

[07:48:20 - 07:48:25]
provisioned and I'm not sure why I can't

[07:48:21 - 07:48:28]
find this today maybe it's under

[07:48:25 - 07:48:30]
meta yeah I don't know it's uh

[07:48:28 - 07:48:32]
there used to be two options here and

[07:48:30 - 07:48:35]
I'm not sure why it's only showing on

[07:48:32 - 07:48:37]
demand but on demand means that you are

[07:48:35 - 07:48:38]
uh you deploy it and then you consume

[07:48:37 - 07:48:40]
like whatever credits you consume is

[07:48:38 - 07:48:42]
what you spend there is another Mode

[07:48:40 - 07:48:44]
called uh provisioned but I'm not sure

[07:48:42 - 07:48:45]
why it's not showing up here today but

[07:48:44 - 07:48:46]
that's totally fine so I'm going to go

[07:48:45 - 07:48:50]
ahead and choose Nova light we'll hit

[07:48:46 - 07:48:52]
apply sorry for being all over the place

[07:48:50 - 07:48:54]
and so we have our Amazon Bedrock chat

[07:48:52 - 07:48:58]
experience here so I can go ahead and

[07:48:54 - 07:49:01]
we'll just say hello um how are you if

[07:48:58 - 07:49:03]
we want to start working with this okay

[07:49:01 - 07:49:04]
so hello I'm doing well thank you for

[07:49:03 - 07:49:06]
asking how can assist you today if you

[07:49:04 - 07:49:09]
have any questions or need information

[07:49:06 - 07:49:11]
particular topic uh feel free to let me

[07:49:09 - 07:49:13]
know so pretty straightforward um this

[07:49:11 - 07:49:14]
is not the same thing as an AI powered

[07:49:13 - 07:49:17]
assistant AI powered assistant doesn't

[07:49:14 - 07:49:19]
give you all these parameters and and

[07:49:17 - 07:49:21]
dialogues you can work with and also an

[07:49:19 - 07:49:23]
AI powered assistant is going to have a

[07:49:21 - 07:49:25]
lot more um things going on in the

[07:49:23 - 07:49:27]
background you could build your own AI

[07:49:25 - 07:49:29]
power assistant within Amazon Bedrock

[07:49:27 - 07:49:30]
where it it's under agents so you could

[07:49:29 - 07:49:33]
create it there you can see I already

[07:49:30 - 07:49:35]
have one created from before um but yeah

[07:49:33 - 07:49:37]
this one is pretty straightforward uh

[07:49:35 - 07:49:38]
you should know how to programmatically

[07:49:37 - 07:49:40]
work with Amazon badrock and so that's

[07:49:38 - 07:49:42]
something that I think that we should

[07:49:40 - 07:49:43]
spend a little bit of time doing so

[07:49:42 - 07:49:46]
we're going to need a notebook so let's

[07:49:43 - 07:49:48]
make our way over to Sage maker okay and

[07:49:46 - 07:49:50]
so I showed you in another video how to

[07:49:48 - 07:49:52]
use Sage maker um they renamed it to

[07:49:50 - 07:49:54]
Sage maker AI obviously they want to put

[07:49:52 - 07:49:56]
AI in there to uh let people know what

[07:49:54 - 07:49:58]
it is and so if I go over to getting

[07:49:56 - 07:50:01]
started here or sorry Studio you should

[07:49:58 - 07:50:03]
already have one um set up from the time

[07:50:01 - 07:50:05]
we were going through notebooks if you

[07:50:03 - 07:50:07]
don't know how to do that go take a look

[07:50:05 - 07:50:08]
at how to do that so stagemaker studio

[07:50:07 - 07:50:10]
is opening here I'm going to go over to

[07:50:08 - 07:50:13]
Jupiter Labs we're going to create a new

[07:50:10 - 07:50:15]
Jupiter space I'm going to say my uh

[07:50:13 - 07:50:17]
space um and we're going to go ahead and

[07:50:15 - 07:50:19]
create that space this is an MLT 3

[07:50:17 - 07:50:23]
medium I believe it costs a nickel an

[07:50:19 - 07:50:25]
hour um so if you can't afford a nickel

[07:50:23 - 07:50:28]
don't run this you could also use Amazon

[07:50:25 - 07:50:31]
Bedrock locally it's just an API so you

[07:50:28 - 07:50:34]
could foro this cost if you want um but

[07:50:31 - 07:50:36]
again I try to use always um Cloud uh

[07:50:34 - 07:50:38]
Cloud IDs and I'm trying to use the one

[07:50:36 - 07:50:40]
that is specific to the provider so if

[07:50:38 - 07:50:42]
you want to go use a git pod uh or

[07:50:40 - 07:50:44]
GitHub code spaces on your free credits

[07:50:42 - 07:50:46]
you absolutely can but I'm running it

[07:50:44 - 07:50:49]
here today so just choose whichever

[07:50:46 - 07:50:50]
notebook you want to utilize so this is

[07:50:49 - 07:50:53]
just starting to get spun up here so I'm

[07:50:50 - 07:50:53]
just

[07:50:53 - 07:50:57]
waiting okay and I'm just going to pause

[07:50:56 - 07:50:59]
here and wait till the space becomes

[07:50:57 - 07:51:03]
ready

[07:50:59 - 07:51:04]
all right so um our uh our our

[07:51:03 - 07:51:05]
environment is ready I'm going to go

[07:51:04 - 07:51:08]
ahead and Launch Open jupyter Lab

[07:51:05 - 07:51:10]
because we are again using um bedrock

[07:51:08 - 07:51:12]
and everything is being taken care for

[07:51:10 - 07:51:15]
us we're not downloading model so it's

[07:51:12 - 07:51:17]
very um easy for us to use the small

[07:51:15 - 07:51:19]
size of storage and we do not need any

[07:51:17 - 07:51:21]
kind of powerful compute whatsoever I'm

[07:51:19 - 07:51:23]
going to go here on the left hand side

[07:51:21 - 07:51:24]
create a new notebook I'm going to

[07:51:23 - 07:51:27]
rename this

[07:51:24 - 07:51:30]
notebook okay I'm going to rename it

[07:51:27 - 07:51:32]
to um what will I rename this to just

[07:51:30 - 07:51:33]
basic and let's see if we can go ahead

[07:51:32 - 07:51:36]
and make some code here now we do have

[07:51:33 - 07:51:38]
Amazon developer Q here or Amazon Q as

[07:51:36 - 07:51:40]
they call it and if I have access to

[07:51:38 - 07:51:43]
this I might ask it to write me some

[07:51:40 - 07:51:44]
code so give me an example of using

[07:51:43 - 07:51:48]
Amazon

[07:51:44 - 07:51:50]
Bedrock um via the python SDK and it

[07:51:48 - 07:51:52]
just happens to be here so I'm going to

[07:51:50 - 07:51:54]
give it a go you're not subscribed to

[07:51:52 - 07:51:56]
Amazon Q developer please request domain

[07:51:54 - 07:51:59]
into that not going to do that so that's

[07:51:56 - 07:52:02]
totally fine um so so I will just go

[07:51:59 - 07:52:05]
ahead and go look up it manually so say

[07:52:02 - 07:52:07]
Amazon Bedrock API and if we go over

[07:52:05 - 07:52:11]
here to our API

[07:52:07 - 07:52:13]
reference um honestly I want Bodo to be

[07:52:11 - 07:52:17]
honest Amazon

[07:52:13 - 07:52:19]
Bedrock uh Bodo Bodo 3 and if we go to

[07:52:17 - 07:52:22]
the documentation we have a bunch of

[07:52:19 - 07:52:27]
runtime so we type in Bedrock

[07:52:22 - 07:52:29]
here we have Bedrock Bedrock runtime um

[07:52:27 - 07:52:32]
and agents for Bedrock so for Bedrock is

[07:52:29 - 07:52:33]
for Amazon Bedrock agent Bedrock is for

[07:52:32 - 07:52:35]
infrastructure on bedrock and Bedrock

[07:52:33 - 07:52:37]
runtime is actually working with models

[07:52:35 - 07:52:39]
so this is the one that we want and they

[07:52:37 - 07:52:41]
have invoke model and the newer one

[07:52:39 - 07:52:43]
called Converse I'm going to use

[07:52:41 - 07:52:44]
Converse here today because that one's a

[07:52:43 - 07:52:47]
lot better and so we're going to start

[07:52:44 - 07:52:48]
working with uh this one here so I'm

[07:52:47 - 07:52:49]
going to go over to here I'm going to

[07:52:48 - 07:52:51]
try to use my

[07:52:49 - 07:52:53]
memory uh to do this we're going to say

[07:52:51 - 07:52:56]
import boto

[07:52:53 - 07:52:58]
3 um which be funny if I can just do

[07:52:56 - 07:53:03]
this for memory and I need to uh it's

[07:52:58 - 07:53:06]
initialize a Bedrock runtime client so

[07:53:03 - 07:53:07]
I'm going to try this client equals

[07:53:06 - 07:53:09]
again just trying to do this for

[07:53:07 - 07:53:11]
memory like

[07:53:09 - 07:53:14]
that

[07:53:11 - 07:53:15]
and uh yeah it doesn't like that so I

[07:53:14 - 07:53:18]
again I again hoping I could just do

[07:53:15 - 07:53:20]
that for memory but I guess not exactly

[07:53:18 - 07:53:23]
so I'll go back a step yeah so I'm just

[07:53:20 - 07:53:23]
missing this

[07:53:23 - 07:53:27]
okay I try my best to try to do things

[07:53:25 - 07:53:29]
for memory because it's just better uh

[07:53:27 - 07:53:31]
long term for me but to we'll go back

[07:53:29 - 07:53:33]
over to here and we'll go ahead and grab

[07:53:31 - 07:53:35]
the response Converse and so it has some

[07:53:33 - 07:53:40]
options it needs the model

[07:53:35 - 07:53:42]
ID okay see you don't need chat GPT when

[07:53:40 - 07:53:44]
you got Andrew to help you here um and

[07:53:42 - 07:53:47]
so we're going to go over to St maker

[07:53:44 - 07:53:50]
not stage maker Studio but um back to

[07:53:47 - 07:53:52]
bedrock and so we need a model

[07:53:50 - 07:53:56]
ID right so if I want to use something

[07:53:52 - 07:53:58]
here I'm going to go to the model

[07:53:56 - 07:54:00]
catalog shows that there's like 46 of

[07:53:58 - 07:54:02]
servess which is great um but we're

[07:54:00 - 07:54:04]
going to stick with the Amazon models

[07:54:02 - 07:54:06]
here for today I'm going with Nova light

[07:54:04 - 07:54:09]
so I'll click into that uh oh it's a

[07:54:06 - 07:54:10]
multimodal that's that's pretty sweet um

[07:54:09 - 07:54:13]
maybe all I want is actually text so I

[07:54:10 - 07:54:15]
actually might change it to um I'm going

[07:54:13 - 07:54:16]
to go back to just Amazon here I'm

[07:54:15 - 07:54:19]
actually just going to micro I all I

[07:54:16 - 07:54:21]
want here is text to be honest and so

[07:54:19 - 07:54:23]
the model I'm looking for is this model

[07:54:21 - 07:54:24]
ID so I'm going to go ahead and grab

[07:54:23 - 07:54:26]
that it's actually up here as well which

[07:54:24 - 07:54:28]
is a little bit easier and we're going

[07:54:26 - 07:54:29]
to go ahead and paste that in um I'll

[07:54:28 - 07:54:31]
bump up the font here a little bit I

[07:54:29 - 07:54:34]
know it's very very small and so we need

[07:54:31 - 07:54:35]
our standard messages in here so that is

[07:54:34 - 07:54:38]
uh pretty straightforward it's either

[07:54:35 - 07:54:41]
user assistant which is pretty much

[07:54:38 - 07:54:42]
standardized for um the Bedrock API

[07:54:41 - 07:54:44]
which is one reason why I like the

[07:54:42 - 07:54:47]
converse

[07:54:44 - 07:54:50]
API okay and so here is one message and

[07:54:47 - 07:54:51]
this is going to be the user you always

[07:54:50 - 07:54:56]
have to start with the user first

[07:54:51 - 07:54:59]
apparently um and I think it' be content

[07:54:56 - 07:54:59]
I'm just guessing here

[07:55:01 - 07:55:07]
okay I got to go back over to here well

[07:55:04 - 07:55:13]
here uh yeah we have content and then we

[07:55:07 - 07:55:16]
have to specify what it is so within it

[07:55:13 - 07:55:19]
um it looks like yeah we'll have to

[07:55:16 - 07:55:21]
specify that it's um

[07:55:19 - 07:55:23]
this okay so the content is really going

[07:55:21 - 07:55:23]
to

[07:55:24 - 07:55:30]
be this here and the reason why we have

[07:55:27 - 07:55:32]
to do this is because because um certain

[07:55:30 - 07:55:34]
some models take in text and other ones

[07:55:32 - 07:55:36]
don't and so you see text image document

[07:55:34 - 07:55:38]
tool use So based on what you're passing

[07:55:36 - 07:55:40]
in is going to vary but we're just

[07:55:38 - 07:55:42]
passing in text this is a Texton model

[07:55:40 - 07:55:43]
and so this is what we have to do

[07:55:42 - 07:55:45]
there's probably like a shorthand for

[07:55:43 - 07:55:46]
this so we don't have to write as much

[07:55:45 - 07:55:48]
but I'm just going to go with the the

[07:55:46 - 07:55:52]
full hand here it's totally fine I'm

[07:55:48 - 07:55:53]
going to wrap that as well here um and

[07:55:52 - 07:55:55]
we still need this to

[07:55:53 - 07:55:58]
close the only thing I don't have here

[07:55:55 - 07:55:59]
is like let's say system prompt which is

[07:55:58 - 07:56:00]
down below here so that's going to be

[07:55:59 - 07:56:04]
system

[07:56:00 - 07:56:04]
text okay so go ahead and do

[07:56:05 - 07:56:10]
this and this one is

[07:56:08 - 07:56:15]
um

[07:56:10 - 07:56:15]
similar but we have yeah just text

[07:56:16 - 07:56:20]
string so this will be

[07:56:23 - 07:56:27]
this okay uh you

[07:56:25 - 07:56:29]
[Music]

[07:56:27 - 07:56:31]
are you're

[07:56:29 - 07:56:32]
correcting my

[07:56:31 - 07:56:35]
English

[07:56:32 - 07:56:38]
grammar and spelling

[07:56:35 - 07:56:40]
mistakes okay

[07:56:38 - 07:56:41]
so so I've prompted it to tell it what

[07:56:40 - 07:56:44]
to

[07:56:41 - 07:56:47]
do uh there is a little highlighting

[07:56:44 - 07:56:48]
issue here so it does not like something

[07:56:47 - 07:56:51]
I'm just trying to oh you know what it's

[07:56:48 - 07:56:53]
because I have a uh s uh single within

[07:56:51 - 07:56:54]
the middle of there there we go and so

[07:56:53 - 07:56:57]
this should be the most basic thing that

[07:56:54 - 07:56:58]
we need to set up and so I'm going to go

[07:56:57 - 07:57:02]
ahead here and just write something so

[07:56:58 - 07:57:05]
let say um

[07:57:02 - 07:57:07]
hello what's

[07:57:05 - 07:57:09]
the

[07:57:07 - 07:57:12]
weather

[07:57:09 - 07:57:15]
like around

[07:57:12 - 07:57:18]
here okay

[07:57:15 - 07:57:19]
so I'm not sure if it will be able to do

[07:57:18 - 07:57:20]
this but we will give it a try I've

[07:57:19 - 07:57:22]
never used micro I don't know how

[07:57:20 - 07:57:26]
intelligent it

[07:57:22 - 07:57:27]
is um it doesn't like the spaces here so

[07:57:26 - 07:57:29]
I'll just take that out it's not really

[07:57:27 - 07:57:30]
a problem it's just

[07:57:29 - 07:57:34]
spaces

[07:57:30 - 07:57:36]
and provisional argument follows

[07:57:34 - 07:57:37]
keyword yeah I'm not sure what it's

[07:57:36 - 07:57:39]
trying to say there but I'm just go go

[07:57:37 - 07:57:41]
ahead and bring this onto its own

[07:57:39 - 07:57:43]
line I'm just trying to get rid of all

[07:57:41 - 07:57:44]
the um stuff here yeah this one has oh

[07:57:43 - 07:57:46]
that's an equals okay let let's do that

[07:57:44 - 07:57:50]
instead there we

[07:57:46 - 07:57:52]
go and so that looks good to me so I'm

[07:57:50 - 07:57:55]
going to go ahead and run that and we

[07:57:52 - 07:57:56]
have an error we'll go down invalid type

[07:57:55 - 07:58:00]
for parameter

[07:57:56 - 07:58:03]
system um expecting type class

[07:58:00 - 07:58:05]
dictionary but class list tupal um so

[07:58:03 - 07:58:08]
I'm gonna go back over to here oh and it

[07:58:05 - 07:58:10]
wants an array of it okay that's

[07:58:08 - 07:58:11]
fair I mean I don't know why it would

[07:58:10 - 07:58:14]
only ever take one but we'll go ahead

[07:58:11 - 07:58:16]
and do that and so now I'm going to go

[07:58:14 - 07:58:19]
ahead and print the

[07:58:16 - 07:58:21]
response let's see what we

[07:58:19 - 07:58:23]
got so we have a bit here a little bit

[07:58:21 - 07:58:25]
too much going on here so I can't really

[07:58:23 - 07:58:27]
see what I'm doing but we do have output

[07:58:25 - 07:58:30]
here so I'm going to go ahead and try

[07:58:27 - 07:58:34]
this I'm really just taking a guess

[07:58:30 - 07:58:37]
here there we go and so getting closer

[07:58:34 - 07:58:37]
we have the

[07:58:40 - 07:58:46]
message

[07:58:42 - 07:58:46]
okay and then I want the

[07:58:46 - 07:58:52]
content and I know it's very verbose but

[07:58:48 - 07:58:55]
once you get your your uh code wrapped

[07:58:52 - 07:58:55]
around here it's not so

[07:58:56 - 07:59:00]
bad I'm going to assume there was like a

[07:58:58 - 07:59:02]
zero in there A lot of times these are

[07:59:00 - 07:59:04]
in Rays so sirch shers here is the

[07:59:02 - 07:59:06]
corrected version of your sentence hello

[07:59:04 - 07:59:09]
what's the weather like around here here

[07:59:06 - 07:59:11]
are the changes I made okay so there you

[07:59:09 - 07:59:14]
go that is the most basic example of

[07:59:11 - 07:59:16]
using Amazon Bedrock um it there's a lot

[07:59:14 - 07:59:19]
of features a lot of different API stuff

[07:59:16 - 07:59:21]
but this will get you the most basic

[07:59:19 - 07:59:24]
stuff you need to know so I'm going to

[07:59:21 - 07:59:27]
call this done um I guess I could

[07:59:24 - 07:59:29]
download this code let me just think

[07:59:27 - 07:59:30]
about this for a second

[07:59:29 - 07:59:32]
yeah I don't really have a repo yet but

[07:59:30 - 07:59:34]
I'll go ahead and make one just in case

[07:59:32 - 07:59:37]
people want it so I'm going to go to

[07:59:34 - 07:59:38]
exam Pro here obviously in other videos

[07:59:37 - 07:59:39]
it'll look like it already existed but

[07:59:38 - 07:59:41]
I'm going to go ahead and make the repo

[07:59:39 - 07:59:43]
quickly so I just created a repo called

[07:59:41 - 07:59:45]
gen Essentials and so I'm just going to

[07:59:43 - 07:59:46]
start uh placing these somewhere so go

[07:59:45 - 07:59:49]
ahead and download

[07:59:46 - 07:59:50]
this download download download download

[07:59:49 - 07:59:52]
download download download here it is

[07:59:50 - 07:59:55]
okay great and I'm going to make a new

[07:59:52 - 07:59:58]
folder here this one's going to be um I

[07:59:55 - 08:00:00]
don't know uh we're looking models the

[07:59:58 - 08:00:03]
service but I'm just going to say

[08:00:00 - 08:00:05]
bedrock and that's what it'll be called

[08:00:03 - 08:00:07]
actually we it Amazon Bedrock I suppose

[08:00:05 - 08:00:10]
Amazon

[08:00:07 - 08:00:12]
bedrock and I'm going to bring

[08:00:10 - 08:00:15]
in that file here so if you for whatever

[08:00:12 - 08:00:18]
reason want to run the exact same one

[08:00:15 - 08:00:22]
there you go

[08:00:18 - 08:00:22]
okay I'll go ahead and commit

[08:00:26 - 08:00:30]
that and before we get out of here I

[08:00:29 - 08:00:32]
just want to make sure I stop that

[08:00:30 - 08:00:34]
workspace I'm going to go ahead and stop

[08:00:32 - 08:00:36]
it and once it stops you can go ahead

[08:00:34 - 08:00:40]
and delete

[08:00:36 - 08:00:40]
it there we

[08:00:41 - 08:00:48]
go and I'll see you in the next one okay

[08:00:44 - 08:00:50]
[Music]

[08:00:48 - 08:00:52]
ciao all right let's take a look at

[08:00:50 - 08:00:54]
Google AI Studio which is another way

[08:00:52 - 08:00:58]
that we can work with

[08:00:54 - 08:01:00]
um uh AI models um obviously so you

[08:00:58 - 08:01:02]
could use Google Cloud but through

[08:01:00 - 08:01:03]
vertex AI Studio but this again is

[08:01:02 - 08:01:06]
another way to do it let's go ahead and

[08:01:03 - 08:01:07]
develop ourselves a new prompt um I'm

[08:01:06 - 08:01:09]
going to go ahead and just agree to the

[08:01:07 - 08:01:11]
terms and apparently I am logged into an

[08:01:09 - 08:01:13]
account here now I wonder if this is

[08:01:11 - 08:01:14]
tied to if I go to plan information is

[08:01:13 - 08:01:17]
this tied to my Google Cloud account let

[08:01:14 - 08:01:20]
me see take a look here

[08:01:17 - 08:01:22]
um so right now I'm just trying to see

[08:01:20 - 08:01:24]
here you can upgrade to paid billing uh

[08:01:22 - 08:01:26]
in your Google Cloud project associated

[08:01:24 - 08:01:28]
with these API key so basically you

[08:01:26 - 08:01:31]
would still have to have Google cloud

[08:01:28 - 08:01:32]
and Associate it with it um but I

[08:01:31 - 08:01:33]
already have a Google Cloud account so I

[08:01:32 - 08:01:35]
should be fine I'm going to go ahead and

[08:01:33 - 08:01:37]
get an API key here and create an API

[08:01:35 - 08:01:40]
key um I don't have an Associated

[08:01:37 - 08:01:43]
project so I'm assuming that I will just

[08:01:40 - 08:01:45]
start to be able to use this and if I

[08:01:43 - 08:01:46]
want to go beond the trial then I will

[08:01:45 - 08:01:47]
have more access to it so I'm going to

[08:01:46 - 08:01:50]
copy that key for now we're going to

[08:01:47 - 08:01:53]
make our way over to GitHub and we're

[08:01:50 - 08:01:55]
going to go over to the Gen Essentials

[08:01:53 - 08:01:58]
is that is what we keep on using here

[08:01:55 - 08:01:58]
today

[08:01:59 - 08:02:04]
and we're going to go over here and I

[08:02:02 - 08:02:05]
actually still have a a workspace

[08:02:04 - 08:02:06]
running so I'll go ahead and open that

[08:02:05 - 08:02:08]
and while I'm waiting I'm just going to

[08:02:06 - 08:02:10]
paste the key over here so that I have

[08:02:08 - 08:02:13]
it somewhere

[08:02:10 - 08:02:14]
okay and we'll go over to the API quick

[08:02:13 - 08:02:17]
start

[08:02:14 - 08:02:20]
guide yeah you can see that they have

[08:02:17 - 08:02:21]
you know they got a thing here that you

[08:02:20 - 08:02:23]
can work

[08:02:21 - 08:02:26]
with

[08:02:23 - 08:02:28]
um but we want to get some example code

[08:02:26 - 08:02:30]
working here oh did I just close out my

[08:02:28 - 08:02:31]
key I totally did but I still probably

[08:02:30 - 08:02:34]
have it on my clipboard so that's

[08:02:31 - 08:02:36]
probably fine so I'll just be patient

[08:02:34 - 08:02:38]
here and wait for this to load so that I

[08:02:36 - 08:02:40]
don't lose my key there you go so I'm

[08:02:38 - 08:02:43]
going to go over here and we will just

[08:02:40 - 08:02:44]
say in a new folder here uh

[08:02:43 - 08:02:45]
Google

[08:02:44 - 08:02:51]
[Music]

[08:02:45 - 08:02:51]
AI uh what's it called Google AI

[08:02:51 - 08:02:56]
studio and I'm going to go ahead here

[08:02:53 - 08:02:59]
and make a new file this will be basic.

[08:02:56 - 08:02:59]
iy

[08:03:00 - 08:03:04]
ipynb okay I'm going to make a new file

[08:03:02 - 08:03:07]
here it's going to be EnV I'm going to

[08:03:04 - 08:03:09]
paste in that key and we'll go ahead and

[08:03:07 - 08:03:11]
make another one here em. example I'm

[08:03:09 - 08:03:14]
also going to go ahead and make a do get

[08:03:11 - 08:03:16]
ignore as per usual we are going to

[08:03:14 - 08:03:18]
ignore thein file I'm going to go over

[08:03:16 - 08:03:21]
to another basic one like open AI here

[08:03:18 - 08:03:22]
I'm going to grab this part as I'm

[08:03:21 - 08:03:26]
definitely going to want

[08:03:22 - 08:03:28]
to load in our environment variables um

[08:03:26 - 08:03:30]
let's go back over to here here and see

[08:03:28 - 08:03:32]
what information we have so here we have

[08:03:30 - 08:03:34]
the PIP install Google generative I

[08:03:32 - 08:03:35]
we'll bring that in and I feel like this

[08:03:34 - 08:03:37]
is very similar from something we did

[08:03:35 - 08:03:39]
before but it's totally fine because

[08:03:37 - 08:03:42]
we're just entering in from another

[08:03:39 - 08:03:45]
interface so we have python. EnV uh

[08:03:42 - 08:03:46]
we'll go ahead and give this an install

[08:03:45 - 08:03:47]
oh you know what we need to put that in

[08:03:46 - 08:03:49]
front of it otherwise it's not going to

[08:03:47 - 08:03:51]
work so we'll try this again I don't

[08:03:49 - 08:03:53]
know if we need the hyphen U to be there

[08:03:51 - 08:03:56]
uh to be honest but we are bringing it

[08:03:53 - 08:03:57]
in we'll bring some code on down here

[08:03:56 - 08:03:59]
and we'll take a look and see how we can

[08:03:57 - 08:04:01]
get get started so here is an example of

[08:03:59 - 08:04:03]
making our first request so I'm going go

[08:04:01 - 08:04:05]
ahead and paste it on in here we have

[08:04:03 - 08:04:08]
our API key I'm going to load that in

[08:04:05 - 08:04:11]
from the environment variables so I'll

[08:04:08 - 08:04:15]
also import um OS

[08:04:11 - 08:04:15]
here and I'm just going to call

[08:04:16 - 08:04:20]
this os.

[08:04:18 - 08:04:25]
Environ

[08:04:20 - 08:04:25]
doget we'll say uh Google API

[08:04:26 - 08:04:29]
key and then we'll go back over to here

[08:04:28 - 08:04:32]
to our

[08:04:29 - 08:04:36]
EnV this will be

[08:04:32 - 08:04:36]
Google um API

[08:04:37 - 08:04:42]
key so now I can go back to here and I

[08:04:40 - 08:04:44]
actually have to run this twice I keep

[08:04:42 - 08:04:48]
forgetting to uh do that in the correct

[08:04:44 - 08:04:53]
order and so this should load it bring

[08:04:48 - 08:04:54]
in gen uh G uh Gemini 1.5 Flash and yeah

[08:04:53 - 08:04:56]
the API looks very straightforward if it

[08:04:54 - 08:04:58]
works that's really

[08:04:56 - 08:05:00]
awesome saying no progress is found that

[08:04:58 - 08:05:02]
has nothing to do with this it's totally

[08:05:00 - 08:05:05]
fine and we are getting response back so

[08:05:02 - 08:05:06]
you can see that uh the Google API is

[08:05:05 - 08:05:10]
really really really

[08:05:06 - 08:05:13]
straightforward um yeah we can go here

[08:05:10 - 08:05:14]
and yeah I guess that's that's all there

[08:05:13 - 08:05:17]
really is to it very straightforward but

[08:05:14 - 08:05:18]
uh yeah that is that and at least you

[08:05:17 - 08:05:20]
know where the Google AI studio uh

[08:05:18 - 08:05:22]
playground is it would take a little bit

[08:05:20 - 08:05:23]
more work to work with Google cloud and

[08:05:22 - 08:05:26]
Link it over um but what's interesting

[08:05:23 - 08:05:28]
is you can obviously bring in files from

[08:05:26 - 08:05:29]
uh your Google Drive and and any of the

[08:05:28 - 08:05:31]
functionality that you want to work with

[08:05:29 - 08:05:32]
you can obviously work with

[08:05:31 - 08:05:34]
programmatically so that's very

[08:05:32 - 08:05:35]
interesting there but I will see you in

[08:05:34 - 08:05:39]
the next one

[08:05:35 - 08:05:41]
[Music]

[08:05:39 - 08:05:42]
ciao hey everyone it's Andrew Brown in

[08:05:41 - 08:05:45]
this video I want to take a look at uh

[08:05:42 - 08:05:47]
vertex AI uh model Garden offering so we

[08:05:45 - 08:05:48]
can start working with models very

[08:05:47 - 08:05:50]
easily I already have a project set up

[08:05:48 - 08:05:52]
here I just throw everything in my

[08:05:50 - 08:05:54]
FreeBSD and I promised that I would turn

[08:05:52 - 08:05:55]
on MFA I think I'm just going to go

[08:05:54 - 08:05:58]
ahead and do that very quickly so just

[08:05:55 - 08:06:01]
give me a moment okay all right so I've

[08:05:58 - 08:06:04]
turned on MFA so no one can uh uh look

[08:06:01 - 08:06:06]
poorly upon me anymore I'm working in

[08:06:04 - 08:06:08]
existing project um maybe I should make

[08:06:06 - 08:06:10]
a new project let me get rid of a few of

[08:06:08 - 08:06:12]
these first just give me a moment okay I

[08:06:10 - 08:06:13]
just want to manage uh resources if

[08:06:12 - 08:06:15]
you've never uh had to delete a project

[08:06:13 - 08:06:17]
it's pretty straightforward you just go

[08:06:15 - 08:06:19]
ahead and delete it and you do that so

[08:06:17 - 08:06:21]
I'm going to go ahead and just quickly

[08:06:19 - 08:06:22]
delete as many projects as I can okay

[08:06:21 - 08:06:23]
there we go that was some good clean up

[08:06:22 - 08:06:27]
I'm going to go ahead and create a new

[08:06:23 - 08:06:28]
project this will be just gen Essentials

[08:06:27 - 08:06:30]
gen

[08:06:28 - 08:06:32]
Essentials I'll go ahead and create that

[08:06:30 - 08:06:34]
project uh just because if we run into

[08:06:32 - 08:06:36]
any specific issues with activating

[08:06:34 - 08:06:38]
stuff I want to show you that

[08:06:36 - 08:06:40]
um it's really easy Once you have a

[08:06:38 - 08:06:42]
Google project just to work within it

[08:06:40 - 08:06:44]
but uh always from scratch is kind of a

[08:06:42 - 08:06:45]
pain I want to make sure that project is

[08:06:44 - 08:06:47]
selected so I hit select project and so

[08:06:45 - 08:06:50]
now I'm under Jenning Essentials let's

[08:06:47 - 08:06:51]
make our way over to vertex AI as this

[08:06:50 - 08:06:54]
is where uh we're going to be able to do

[08:06:51 - 08:06:56]
the stuff that we want to

[08:06:54 - 08:06:59]
do okay I'm just going to be honest with

[08:06:56 - 08:07:00]
you I'm not us using vertex AI that much

[08:06:59 - 08:07:02]
as of as of late but I'm sure we'll

[08:07:00 - 08:07:04]
figure it out very quickly get started

[08:07:02 - 08:07:06]
with vertex AI empowers machine learning

[08:07:04 - 08:07:08]
enable all recommended API let's give

[08:07:06 - 08:07:10]
that a go be nice if it tells us what

[08:07:08 - 08:07:12]
it's enabling but I'm going to go press

[08:07:10 - 08:07:13]
that and we'll see uh what happens here

[08:07:12 - 08:07:16]
it might tell us up here in the top

[08:07:13 - 08:07:18]
right corner so yeah compute data flow

[08:07:16 - 08:07:20]
notebook so those are all three key ones

[08:07:18 - 08:07:21]
that we want and so that's what I was

[08:07:20 - 08:07:25]
wondering it's like we start trying to

[08:07:21 - 08:07:27]
use a model it's like do we have compute

[08:07:25 - 08:07:30]
um but this is vertex AI but then we

[08:07:27 - 08:07:31]
have Vex AI Studio down below here um we

[08:07:30 - 08:07:33]
obviously want to work with a notebook

[08:07:31 - 08:07:36]
so we'll definitely do that um but this

[08:07:33 - 08:07:40]
is kind of where the geni stuff lives is

[08:07:36 - 08:07:43]
down here below um so yeah we have open

[08:07:40 - 08:07:45]
free form so non- chat tasks like

[08:07:43 - 08:07:48]
classification extraction so remember

[08:07:45 - 08:07:50]
over ads they called it single prompt or

[08:07:48 - 08:07:52]
something like that and then over at

[08:07:50 - 08:07:55]
Azure I think it's called Uh chat

[08:07:52 - 08:07:56]
completion so they call it free form and

[08:07:55 - 08:07:58]
then we have a chat why why everyone

[08:07:56 - 08:08:00]
names it differently I don't know they'

[08:07:58 - 08:08:02]
like to keep us on our toes um and we

[08:08:00 - 08:08:03]
obviously have a bunch in the prompt

[08:08:02 - 08:08:06]
Gallery but we go over to

[08:08:03 - 08:08:08]
here um and yeah very similar interface

[08:08:06 - 08:08:10]
to the other ones but the thing is is

[08:08:08 - 08:08:12]
that we probably want to utilize some

[08:08:10 - 08:08:13]
models but we haven't really had to

[08:08:12 - 08:08:15]
deploy anything I'm not sure if we even

[08:08:13 - 08:08:18]
have to deploy anything in in here in

[08:08:15 - 08:08:21]
the same way um but let's say we wanted

[08:08:18 - 08:08:21]
to use

[08:08:21 - 08:08:25]
something let's go take a look

[08:08:23 - 08:08:27]
here I like how we just have hugging

[08:08:25 - 08:08:31]
face models here and a bunch of of them

[08:08:27 - 08:08:33]
but um I'm just looking for all

[08:08:31 - 08:08:35]
the foundational models here we go this

[08:08:33 - 08:08:37]
is what I want to see and so I'm just

[08:08:35 - 08:08:39]
looking for something that I recognize

[08:08:37 - 08:08:42]
like Hau because this is something that

[08:08:39 - 08:08:44]
you normally would have to accept um

[08:08:42 - 08:08:46]
permissions to gain access to page not

[08:08:44 - 08:08:49]
viewable for organizations do this page

[08:08:46 - 08:08:51]
select a project okay and so you have to

[08:08:49 - 08:08:52]
enable it okay so if we want to use it

[08:08:51 - 08:08:55]
we'd have to enable it first that's what

[08:08:52 - 08:08:56]
I was expecting right um so something

[08:08:55 - 08:08:58]
similar for model access but we're doing

[08:08:56 - 08:09:01]
this on individual level but let's go

[08:08:58 - 08:09:03]
back over to our chat here and what I

[08:09:01 - 08:09:06]
want to do is I want to see if I can

[08:09:03 - 08:09:08]
select um anthropic here what will

[08:09:06 - 08:09:10]
happen if I do this and so it says to

[08:09:08 - 08:09:11]
use it you have to go here and enable it

[08:09:10 - 08:09:15]
okay so if we want to use it I'd have to

[08:09:11 - 08:09:17]
go over to here and then we'll give it a

[08:09:15 - 08:09:20]
moment and then we'd have to enable it

[08:09:17 - 08:09:22]
right and it asks for some information

[08:09:20 - 08:09:24]
so we have a lot of stuff here I'm going

[08:09:22 - 08:09:26]
to fill it in just a moment all right so

[08:09:24 - 08:09:29]
nothing super sensitive here do you also

[08:09:26 - 08:09:31]
have use cases is uh requirements per do

[08:09:29 - 08:09:34]
you have any do you have any of your use

[08:09:31 - 08:09:36]
cases have additional requirements no um

[08:09:34 - 08:09:38]
nope we're not doing anything uh crazy

[08:09:36 - 08:09:40]
here let's go ahead and hit next just to

[08:09:38 - 08:09:42]
show you what this experience is like I

[08:09:40 - 08:09:44]
like that it shows us the pricing right

[08:09:42 - 08:09:47]
away so 1 million tokens is about a

[08:09:44 - 08:09:49]
dollar something here so we'll go ahead

[08:09:47 - 08:09:51]
and say agree so that we know that we're

[08:09:49 - 08:09:53]
agreeing to those costs um and it says

[08:09:51 - 08:09:54]
that we purchased it we're not really we

[08:09:53 - 08:09:56]
didn't really purchase anything but we

[08:09:54 - 08:09:57]
just enabled it um I'm not sure if it's

[08:09:56 - 08:10:01]
enabled I'm going to give us this a hard

[08:09:57 - 08:10:04]
refresh sometimes the UI is um uh not as

[08:10:01 - 08:10:07]
clear as it could be okay so we have

[08:10:04 - 08:10:09]
that there and I like how we can open

[08:10:07 - 08:10:12]
this right away in a notebook let's take

[08:10:09 - 08:10:15]
a look at some view code

[08:10:12 - 08:10:17]
here I mean that's

[08:10:15 - 08:10:19]
fine I'm curious to click this but this

[08:10:17 - 08:10:21]
is going to open up in Enterprise I

[08:10:19 - 08:10:25]
don't want to open in

[08:10:21 - 08:10:29]
Enterprise oh I did not want to open an

[08:10:25 - 08:10:29]
Enterprise m

[08:10:30 - 08:10:37]
I mean it's fine let's go take a look

[08:10:31 - 08:10:37]
here coab Enterprise

[08:10:40 - 08:10:43]
pricing what's the

[08:10:44 - 08:10:50]
cost oh okay it's pretty reasonable so

[08:10:47 - 08:10:53]
then what's the collab Enterprise versus

[08:10:50 - 08:10:57]
workbench why why do we have two

[08:10:53 - 08:10:57]
then give me a second okay so this one's

[08:10:57 - 08:10:59]
saying

[08:10:57 - 08:11:02]
developer focus and this one is more

[08:10:59 - 08:11:05]
collaborative this one's serverless user

[08:11:02 - 08:11:07]
controlled uh limited extensive

[08:11:05 - 08:11:10]
automatic

[08:11:07 - 08:11:13]
configurable um okay well I mean I don't

[08:11:10 - 08:11:15]
mind that I suppose that's fine I didn't

[08:11:13 - 08:11:17]
I didn't show it later on but I may have

[08:11:15 - 08:11:19]
to make another video of it um so anyway

[08:11:17 - 08:11:23]
I guess we have an example

[08:11:19 - 08:11:24]
here and I mean if this example works we

[08:11:23 - 08:11:26]
can just go ahead and utilize it so

[08:11:24 - 08:11:28]
Claude on vertex AI so we'll scroll on

[08:11:26 - 08:11:30]
down

[08:11:28 - 08:11:32]
um so we have

[08:11:30 - 08:11:34]
htpx Google collap I'm just reading it

[08:11:32 - 08:11:38]
to see what it

[08:11:34 - 08:11:40]
does um select the model that's a mess

[08:11:38 - 08:11:41]
mess of a code

[08:11:40 - 08:11:45]
[Music]

[08:11:41 - 08:11:49]
mm what I'm looking for here is I want

[08:11:45 - 08:11:52]
to see what the code looks

[08:11:49 - 08:11:55]
like they must have a they must have an

[08:11:52 - 08:11:59]
SDK using anthropics vertex

[08:11:55 - 08:12:01]
xdk vertex SDK

[08:11:59 - 08:12:04]
okay

[08:12:01 - 08:12:06]
um huh that's

[08:12:04 - 08:12:09]
interesting so I'm not I'm not sure

[08:12:06 - 08:12:11]
about this so I go ahead and delete this

[08:12:09 - 08:12:14]
and

[08:12:11 - 08:12:16]
confirm so I'm going to go over

[08:12:14 - 08:12:18]
here now I have no notebooks running

[08:12:16 - 08:12:21]
which is totally fine so yeah I'm not

[08:12:18 - 08:12:25]
100% sure about that um that's not

[08:12:21 - 08:12:26]
exactly what I wanted but um I want to

[08:12:25 - 08:12:28]
see how we can programmatically work

[08:12:26 - 08:12:29]
with this stuff I mean like the chat's

[08:12:28 - 08:12:31]
going to be very straightforward if we

[08:12:29 - 08:12:33]
go here and we use Gemini flash which is

[08:12:31 - 08:12:36]
a super super fast one here we go down

[08:12:33 - 08:12:38]
below and just say hello how are you you

[08:12:36 - 08:12:41]
know you get the idea of what it can do

[08:12:38 - 08:12:43]
it's going to talk back to us um but I'm

[08:12:41 - 08:12:47]
looking for some code and up here it

[08:12:43 - 08:12:48]
says get code let's go click that okay

[08:12:47 - 08:12:51]
so this looks good and this says open a

[08:12:48 - 08:12:51]
notebook so we

[08:12:51 - 08:12:55]
have yeah yeah yeah so this is more what

[08:12:53 - 08:12:57]
I want so let's go ahead and click

[08:12:55 - 08:12:59]
that okay

[08:12:57 - 08:13:01]
if this opens in collab Enterprise

[08:12:59 - 08:13:04]
that's totally fine collab Enterprise I

[08:13:01 - 08:13:07]
guess is totally okay to

[08:13:04 - 08:13:10]
use okay so I'm going to go ahead and we

[08:13:07 - 08:13:12]
say install the vertex AI

[08:13:10 - 08:13:15]
SDK open a terminal window and enter the

[08:13:12 - 08:13:15]
command

[08:13:15 - 08:13:20]
below uh well why don't we just run it

[08:13:21 - 08:13:28]
here okay we'll go ahead and give this

[08:13:25 - 08:13:28]
access

[08:13:35 - 08:13:39]
give that a moment to install or do

[08:13:37 - 08:13:41]
whatever it wants to

[08:13:39 - 08:13:43]
do there we go and now it is uh starting

[08:13:41 - 08:13:44]
I think it was just starting the um the

[08:13:43 - 08:13:46]
compute underneath and that's why it was

[08:13:44 - 08:13:48]
so slow it said this is going to run for

[08:13:46 - 08:13:50]
17 hours I I assume we can stop it

[08:13:48 - 08:13:53]
somehow um if we go to run times I'm not

[08:13:50 - 08:13:55]
sure oh no no no no I don't want to do

[08:13:53 - 08:13:57]
that I was hoping we could just see the

[08:13:55 - 08:14:00]
run time but I'm just going to let it do

[08:13:57 - 08:14:00]
what it wants to do

[08:14:00 - 08:14:05]
here so it seems like it's almost done

[08:14:03 - 08:14:07]
so we'll just wait here a little bit

[08:14:05 - 08:14:09]
more there we go the following package

[08:14:07 - 08:14:11]
were previously imported in this runtime

[08:14:09 - 08:14:13]
you must restart the runtime in order to

[08:14:11 - 08:14:16]
use the newly started packages so we'll

[08:14:13 - 08:14:16]
say yes let's go ahead and do

[08:14:16 - 08:14:22]
that um you know this isn't my favorite

[08:14:20 - 08:14:23]
experience I think I I like workbench

[08:14:22 - 08:14:25]
cuz we get Jupiter notebooks I think

[08:14:23 - 08:14:28]
that's what we were utilizing there but

[08:14:25 - 08:14:30]
um this is fine did this restart I

[08:14:28 - 08:14:32]
cannot tell if it did I'm going to

[08:14:30 - 08:14:33]
assume that it did let's go ahead and

[08:14:32 - 08:14:36]
look at the next code so we have vertex

[08:14:33 - 08:14:38]
AI generative models so we're bringing

[08:14:36 - 08:14:39]
that in this kind of looks like a

[08:14:38 - 08:14:42]
hugging face to me like the way they're

[08:14:39 - 08:14:43]
doing this and so we're initializing a

[08:14:42 - 08:14:45]
new project for Gen Essentials that's

[08:14:43 - 08:14:48]
what we're in right now in US Central

[08:14:45 - 08:14:50]
one which that's fine we're specifying

[08:14:48 - 08:14:54]
the model here we are going to start a

[08:14:50 - 08:14:57]
chat we're going to send a message um it

[08:14:54 - 08:14:59]
has generation configuration

[08:14:57 - 08:15:02]
somewhere

[08:14:59 - 08:15:03]
here we have safety settings here I

[08:15:02 - 08:15:06]
don't feel like I'm setting them here

[08:15:03 - 08:15:08]
but oh it's down below okay so I guess

[08:15:06 - 08:15:10]
uh you can set them here and it gets

[08:15:08 - 08:15:12]
pulled up into here that's interesting

[08:15:10 - 08:15:13]
so we have I thought that was only

[08:15:12 - 08:15:14]
hoisting which is what we call in

[08:15:13 - 08:15:16]
JavaScript where it's like you can

[08:15:14 - 08:15:18]
Define it here but it'll work later on I

[08:15:16 - 08:15:20]
didn't think python could do that we

[08:15:18 - 08:15:22]
have Max output tokens temperature stuff

[08:15:20 - 08:15:25]
like that and then the safety settings

[08:15:22 - 08:15:29]
I'd rather have this

[08:15:25 - 08:15:31]
above be less conf using for me but

[08:15:29 - 08:15:33]
um and so for safety settings these are

[08:15:31 - 08:15:35]
basically your guard rails so we say no

[08:15:33 - 08:15:37]
hate speech no dangerous content

[08:15:35 - 08:15:39]
explicit stuff like that and that's very

[08:15:37 - 08:15:40]
typical of Google uh trying to put that

[08:15:39 - 08:15:42]
front and center I mean that's not a bad

[08:15:40 - 08:15:44]
idea let's go ahead and run that and see

[08:15:42 - 08:15:44]
what

[08:15:49 - 08:15:54]
happens okay and we get an output so

[08:15:52 - 08:15:56]
there you go pretty straightforward

[08:15:54 - 08:15:58]
obviously there is a bunch of other

[08:15:56 - 08:15:59]
services in here but these are just

[08:15:58 - 08:16:02]
basically

[08:15:59 - 08:16:04]
um uh these are uh these are like if you

[08:16:02 - 08:16:06]
were using ads these would all be

[08:16:04 - 08:16:08]
isolate services but uh Google collects

[08:16:06 - 08:16:10]
them under here for image and and other

[08:16:08 - 08:16:13]
kinds of generation let's go over to our

[08:16:10 - 08:16:16]
collab Enterprise here okay I'm going to

[08:16:13 - 08:16:20]
go ahead and just delete

[08:16:16 - 08:16:21]
this yes I want to delete it I didn't

[08:16:20 - 08:16:23]
bother putting in our repo just because

[08:16:21 - 08:16:24]
the code is so available now that's

[08:16:23 - 08:16:27]
deleted I'm going to go over to run

[08:16:24 - 08:16:28]
times

[08:16:27 - 08:16:30]
so you can see this is the runtime

[08:16:28 - 08:16:32]
that's running right now so I want to go

[08:16:30 - 08:16:34]
ahead and delete

[08:16:32 - 08:16:35]
it and confirm I'm not sure if you can

[08:16:34 - 08:16:37]
just stop run time so I'm going to go

[08:16:35 - 08:16:39]
ahead and do that and that way we're not

[08:16:37 - 08:16:43]
going to have U continuous

[08:16:39 - 08:16:47]
cost but yeah there you go that is using

[08:16:43 - 08:16:49]
Google Cloud um vertex AI uh um vertex

[08:16:47 - 08:16:53]
AI

[08:16:49 - 08:16:55]
[Music]

[08:16:53 - 08:16:57]
studio all right let's take a look here

[08:16:55 - 08:17:00]
at um using models of service within

[08:16:57 - 08:17:04]
Azure AI studio now I know that there is

[08:17:00 - 08:17:07]
um ai. azure.com which is the new a

[08:17:04 - 08:17:09]
Azure AI found Foundry but it's weird

[08:17:07 - 08:17:11]
because it's called Azure AI Studio but

[08:17:09 - 08:17:13]
it renamed it Azure AI Foundry but it's

[08:17:11 - 08:17:15]
still not called that in the main one

[08:17:13 - 08:17:17]
and that's kind of annoying um and so

[08:17:15 - 08:17:19]
you can go through here or you can go

[08:17:17 - 08:17:22]
through here um and which it should be I

[08:17:19 - 08:17:23]
I really don't know um I suppose we

[08:17:22 - 08:17:25]
could explore it through this way the

[08:17:23 - 08:17:27]
other way is also easy as well but right

[08:17:25 - 08:17:28]
away it's asking you to go create a

[08:17:27 - 08:17:30]
project but what I'm going to do is I'm

[08:17:28 - 08:17:32]
going to make my way over first to Azure

[08:17:30 - 08:17:34]
AI Studio I just want to make sure I get

[08:17:32 - 08:17:35]
rid of anything that I might have here

[08:17:34 - 08:17:37]
so we can kind of experience what that

[08:17:35 - 08:17:38]
other page might look like if we didn't

[08:17:37 - 08:17:40]
have anything because I think that's the

[08:17:38 - 08:17:43]
first thing so I'm going to go in here

[08:17:40 - 08:17:45]
I'm just going to tear down a few things

[08:17:43 - 08:17:46]
um like this Resource Group like you

[08:17:45 - 08:17:49]
obviously wouldn't have this I'm just

[08:17:46 - 08:17:52]
trying to get it back reset to zero

[08:17:49 - 08:17:55]
here um we'll delete

[08:17:52 - 08:17:57]
that and same thing with this one I'm G

[08:17:55 - 08:17:59]
to go into this one here

[08:17:57 - 08:18:01]
give it a moment

[08:17:59 - 08:18:02]
here and it's within the same Resource

[08:18:01 - 08:18:05]
Group so just give me a moment for that

[08:18:02 - 08:18:07]
to tear down

[08:18:05 - 08:18:09]
okay all right so that should be gone

[08:18:07 - 08:18:12]
now there we go so I want to go back

[08:18:09 - 08:18:14]
over to Azure AI Foundry um which is ai.

[08:18:12 - 08:18:16]
azure.com so I just want to see if it

[08:18:14 - 08:18:17]
makes us create anything no it doesn't

[08:18:16 - 08:18:18]
okay great so I'm going to go ahead and

[08:18:17 - 08:18:20]
create a project

[08:18:18 - 08:18:22]
here

[08:18:20 - 08:18:24]
and yeah I don't mind whatever the name

[08:18:22 - 08:18:27]
is we stick with the standard but what I

[08:18:24 - 08:18:28]
find is that the location greatly varies

[08:18:27 - 08:18:31]
notice that it's going to create a hub

[08:18:28 - 08:18:31]
anyway

[08:18:32 - 08:18:38]
so so another way to create it would be

[08:18:34 - 08:18:39]
through Azure Studio here and if you

[08:18:38 - 08:18:41]
create a project we probably create the

[08:18:39 - 08:18:43]
Hub and the project at the same time so

[08:18:41 - 08:18:46]
here's creating the project I'm going to

[08:18:43 - 08:18:48]
go back here and if we create the

[08:18:46 - 08:18:50]
Hub okay it's a little bit different but

[08:18:48 - 08:18:52]
the way it used to work was you make a

[08:18:50 - 08:18:54]
hub and then a project but uh I don't

[08:18:52 - 08:18:56]
know they're they're making it really

[08:18:54 - 08:18:57]
complicated here but this is fine I I'm

[08:18:56 - 08:19:01]
going to go ahead and create this new

[08:18:57 - 08:19:03]
one here um but where the project exist

[08:19:01 - 08:19:05]
really affects what models are available

[08:19:03 - 08:19:08]
to you so you might have to create

[08:19:05 - 08:19:11]
multiple projects to get to other

[08:19:08 - 08:19:12]
um uh to other models but so we're going

[08:19:11 - 08:19:15]
to go ahead and hit create there which I

[08:19:12 - 08:19:17]
did and so now I'm just waiting for this

[08:19:15 - 08:19:19]
to create so we'll just wait a moment

[08:19:17 - 08:19:22]
okay there we go so we have a bit of UI

[08:19:19 - 08:19:24]
here um I don't need to get information

[08:19:22 - 08:19:26]
to explore but there's a couple

[08:19:24 - 08:19:28]
resources that get created for us one is

[08:19:26 - 08:19:30]
azure AI services and then Azure open AI

[08:19:28 - 08:19:33]
so open AI is going to get us access to

[08:19:30 - 08:19:35]
the open AI models Azure a Services is

[08:19:33 - 08:19:37]
going to let us interact with um other

[08:19:35 - 08:19:39]
things on the left hand side here um and

[08:19:37 - 08:19:40]
I guess we have an inference endpoint

[08:19:39 - 08:19:43]
which is what we need to utilize to

[08:19:40 - 08:19:45]
access things so it did spin up a lot of

[08:19:43 - 08:19:48]
things here um so on the le- hand side

[08:19:45 - 08:19:49]
we have um a bunch of interfaces here

[08:19:48 - 08:19:51]
and it's a little bit different from the

[08:19:49 - 08:19:53]
last time I saw it but where we are

[08:19:51 - 08:19:57]
looking for stuff is within the model

[08:19:53 - 08:19:59]
catalog I have activated models prior to

[08:19:57 - 08:20:02]
this but when you are first doing this

[08:19:59 - 08:20:05]
you will have to go open this up and a

[08:20:02 - 08:20:08]
request model access so I'm opening this

[08:20:05 - 08:20:11]
up here and I it's been a while so I'm

[08:20:08 - 08:20:13]
going to see um if it tries to ask for

[08:20:11 - 08:20:15]
model access and it's I already have it

[08:20:13 - 08:20:17]
so you will have to click something fill

[08:20:15 - 08:20:19]
in a form wait a while could take a

[08:20:17 - 08:20:21]
couple days and then you'll be able to

[08:20:19 - 08:20:22]
deploy models so if we want to start

[08:20:21 - 08:20:25]
working with things we're going to go

[08:20:22 - 08:20:27]
over to code um oh this is different

[08:20:25 - 08:20:29]
templates and tutorials no no no no

[08:20:27 - 08:20:32]
that's not what I want I want um

[08:20:29 - 08:20:35]
playground okay and they change the

[08:20:32 - 08:20:37]
interface again here but I say try chat

[08:20:35 - 08:20:40]
playground and so now we'll have to do

[08:20:37 - 08:20:42]
is create a deployment and so we need to

[08:20:40 - 08:20:48]
deploy a model so we have a bunch of

[08:20:42 - 08:20:52]
models here I'm going to go with um chat

[08:20:48 - 08:20:53]
gp4 mini notice that some say chat

[08:20:52 - 08:20:55]
completion and then other ones just say

[08:20:53 - 08:20:58]
completion I think I said this before

[08:20:55 - 08:21:00]
that um if you're on ads it's like it's

[08:20:58 - 08:21:03]
called chat and single prompt if you're

[08:21:00 - 08:21:05]
on um Azure it's chat completion I think

[08:21:03 - 08:21:07]
I said chat completion and chat but it's

[08:21:05 - 08:21:10]
actually chat completion and completion

[08:21:07 - 08:21:12]
and then when you're on Google it is uh

[08:21:10 - 08:21:15]
chat

[08:21:12 - 08:21:18]
and uh some weird name I can't remember

[08:21:15 - 08:21:20]
but it's not it's not normal um but

[08:21:18 - 08:21:21]
anyway or it's like free flow they call

[08:21:20 - 08:21:23]
it free flow I don't know why the naming

[08:21:21 - 08:21:26]
is so bizarre but anyway I'm going to go

[08:21:23 - 08:21:28]
ahead and choose um 01 Mini really

[08:21:26 - 08:21:30]
depends on what you choose here because

[08:21:28 - 08:21:33]
some of them have restrictions on how

[08:21:30 - 08:21:35]
they're deployed and so it's not showing

[08:21:33 - 08:21:37]
me much here I'm not sure why this is

[08:21:35 - 08:21:39]
slightly different this is for chat

[08:21:37 - 08:21:41]
completion so maybe I'll try chat 40

[08:21:39 - 08:21:43]
okay I can deploy this no problem and we

[08:21:41 - 08:21:45]
should choose our deployment options

[08:21:43 - 08:21:47]
which is now up here I guess um so

[08:21:45 - 08:21:49]
manage compute and service API used to

[08:21:47 - 08:21:51]
used to have to select between the two

[08:21:49 - 08:21:52]
and so I'm looking here I'm saying okay

[08:21:51 - 08:21:54]
where is my

[08:21:52 - 08:21:55]
options they've changed this so I don't

[08:21:54 - 08:21:57]
trust this I'm going to go back over to

[08:21:55 - 08:22:00]
here in the top left corner corner I'm

[08:21:57 - 08:22:02]
going to go back um out of 01 mini I'm

[08:22:00 - 08:22:06]
just going to choose the regular GPT

[08:22:02 - 08:22:09]
40 okay if I click deploy what do I

[08:22:06 - 08:22:12]
get now I get the normal UI I'm used to

[08:22:09 - 08:22:13]
so here I have more options and uh it

[08:22:12 - 08:22:15]
has the most options out of all

[08:22:13 - 08:22:16]
providers in terms of deployment options

[08:22:15 - 08:22:18]
I don't know if that's a good or bad

[08:22:16 - 08:22:21]
thing but they just do so if we open

[08:22:18 - 08:22:23]
this here in a new tab it should tell us

[08:22:21 - 08:22:24]
what these all are okay and so you'd

[08:22:23 - 08:22:28]
think that

[08:22:24 - 08:22:29]
um uh you know like uh Global would be

[08:22:28 - 08:22:33]
more expensive than standard but not

[08:22:29 - 08:22:35]
always the case okay so here these are

[08:22:33 - 08:22:38]
pay per token so this one this one this

[08:22:35 - 08:22:40]
one and so

[08:22:38 - 08:22:42]
um I'm just trying to think here Global

[08:22:40 - 08:22:44]
standards probably pretty good uh batch

[08:22:42 - 08:22:45]
is something that is offline so the idea

[08:22:44 - 08:22:47]
is that you're not going to be to infer

[08:22:45 - 08:22:49]
with it right away so global standard is

[08:22:47 - 08:22:51]
what I want here today I'm not going to

[08:22:49 - 08:22:54]
go into all these in great detail I have

[08:22:51 - 08:22:56]
a course specifically for Azure AI that

[08:22:54 - 08:22:58]
if people are interested they go take um

[08:22:56 - 08:23:01]
so now what I can do is go over to the

[08:22:58 - 08:23:02]
playground okay we can well I don't need

[08:23:01 - 08:23:04]
to create a deployment hold on here let

[08:23:02 - 08:23:06]
me just go ahead and refresh this page

[08:23:04 - 08:23:08]
because we've already deployed a model

[08:23:06 - 08:23:10]
and by the way that model is servess so

[08:23:08 - 08:23:13]
if we're not using it it's not costing

[08:23:10 - 08:23:15]
us anything right now and it's saying no

[08:23:13 - 08:23:17]
deployment exists are you sure I'm

[08:23:15 - 08:23:19]
pretty sure I deployed

[08:23:17 - 08:23:22]
something and there used to be a tab

[08:23:19 - 08:23:22]
here for

[08:23:24 - 08:23:29]
deployments interesting

[08:23:27 - 08:23:32]
so where did they put

[08:23:29 - 08:23:33]
it maybe it's model endpoints down here

[08:23:32 - 08:23:35]
here it is okay so this model is

[08:23:33 - 08:23:38]
deployed I'm going to go ahead and open

[08:23:35 - 08:23:40]
in the playground here and so we have a

[08:23:38 - 08:23:42]
similar interface as you would with the

[08:23:40 - 08:23:44]
other ones so let's just say hello how

[08:23:42 - 08:23:44]
are you

[08:23:45 - 08:23:49]
doing we'll hit

[08:23:49 - 08:23:54]
run

[08:23:52 - 08:23:57]
and run

[08:23:54 - 08:24:00]
again um and it's not uh it's not

[08:23:57 - 08:24:02]
submitting for some weird

[08:24:00 - 08:24:03]
reason it's usually not a

[08:24:02 - 08:24:06]
[Music]

[08:24:03 - 08:24:10]
problem there we

[08:24:06 - 08:24:14]
go Azure is uh Azure is known for being

[08:24:10 - 08:24:17]
a bit um buggy to be

[08:24:14 - 08:24:18]
honest like their UI um so that's not

[08:24:17 - 08:24:21]
really working as I hoped so I'm going

[08:24:18 - 08:24:22]
to try this again now we see our

[08:24:21 - 08:24:25]
deployment I'm going to go ahead and try

[08:24:22 - 08:24:25]
this again

[08:24:26 - 08:24:31]
there we go and then it responds okay um

[08:24:29 - 08:24:32]
can we get some code that'd be really

[08:24:31 - 08:24:34]
nice there's probably a code example

[08:24:32 - 08:24:37]
somewhere here view

[08:24:34 - 08:24:39]
code and yeah here we have an

[08:24:37 - 08:24:41]
example um I don't like this particular

[08:24:39 - 08:24:44]
example because this is

[08:24:41 - 08:24:46]
using uh this isn't using an API like

[08:24:44 - 08:24:49]
open API so that's what I would rather

[08:24:46 - 08:24:52]
do here I'd like to use the open API so

[08:24:49 - 08:24:53]
now um I'm not exactly sure how we would

[08:24:52 - 08:24:57]
do this with other models but I

[08:24:53 - 08:24:58]
definitely know um for or uh well I

[08:24:57 - 08:25:01]
guess we maybe use promp flow for that

[08:24:58 - 08:25:05]
but uh for open AI you literally use the

[08:25:01 - 08:25:07]
open AI SDK to to talk to azure's models

[08:25:05 - 08:25:09]
U but for other ones I'm not exactly

[08:25:07 - 08:25:12]
sure like for Claude or Haiku so just

[08:25:09 - 08:25:16]
say um Azure AI

[08:25:12 - 08:25:18]
studio uh uh

[08:25:16 - 08:25:19]
Claude do they have Claude on here I

[08:25:18 - 08:25:23]
believe that they

[08:25:19 - 08:25:23]
do and so that would

[08:25:23 - 08:25:26]
be one that we want to take a look at

[08:25:25 - 08:25:27]
here

[08:25:26 - 08:25:29]
so maybe we'd have to do that through

[08:25:27 - 08:25:32]
Pro prom

[08:25:29 - 08:25:34]
flow Azure asdk this let's take a look

[08:25:32 - 08:25:34]
at

[08:25:36 - 08:25:39]
this

[08:25:41 - 08:25:45]
okay so see here they're talking about

[08:25:43 - 08:25:47]
like okay use open Ai and it's as simple

[08:25:45 - 08:25:47]
as

[08:25:48 - 08:25:54]
that what if you're not using open

[08:25:51 - 08:25:57]
AI right what if you want to use a model

[08:25:54 - 08:25:59]
other than that uh so so powerful access

[08:25:57 - 08:26:02]
for leading

[08:25:59 - 08:26:04]
providers okay but that's if you're

[08:26:02 - 08:26:05]
doing Azure AI inference which means

[08:26:04 - 08:26:07]
probably one that you're running

[08:26:05 - 08:26:10]
constantly I would think I'm not sure

[08:26:07 - 08:26:14]
but we can do gp24 here so I'm wondering

[08:26:10 - 08:26:15]
if Azure AI inference is now the the

[08:26:14 - 08:26:18]
standardized one for all of them so

[08:26:15 - 08:26:20]
let's take a look here and see what we

[08:26:18 - 08:26:22]
have okay so that's how you do it all

[08:26:20 - 08:26:24]
right so maybe that's what we'll we'll

[08:26:22 - 08:26:25]
go ahead and try to use here today um so

[08:26:24 - 08:26:28]
I need some kind of environment to work

[08:26:25 - 08:26:30]
with um I'm going to go use Azure ml

[08:26:28 - 08:26:33]
Studio here today if that's okay with

[08:26:30 - 08:26:34]
everybody you do not need to use Azure

[08:26:33 - 08:26:37]
machine Learning Studio you can use your

[08:26:34 - 08:26:38]
local machine whatever you want I'm just

[08:26:37 - 08:26:41]
trying to get as much practice with you

[08:26:38 - 08:26:42]
here using things uh like this so I'm

[08:26:41 - 08:26:44]
going to go ahead and do that here today

[08:26:42 - 08:26:47]
I'm going to create myself a new

[08:26:44 - 08:26:49]
workspace and this will just

[08:26:47 - 08:26:51]
be I don't know what the other one was

[08:26:49 - 08:26:55]
called um but I'm going go ahead and

[08:26:51 - 08:26:58]
just say AZ coding or a

[08:26:55 - 08:27:01]
ml I go ahead and hit review

[08:26:58 - 08:27:06]
create it doesn't like something

[08:27:01 - 08:27:08]
here a ml there we go review

[08:27:06 - 08:27:10]
create and we'll get our environment up

[08:27:08 - 08:27:11]
here in just a moment I'm waiting for

[08:27:10 - 08:27:13]
this create to

[08:27:11 - 08:27:15]
finish it's initialized in deployment so

[08:27:13 - 08:27:17]
be back here in just a

[08:27:15 - 08:27:19]
moment okay we'll wait for this to

[08:27:17 - 08:27:22]
finish deploying

[08:27:19 - 08:27:23]
okay all right let's go to the resource

[08:27:22 - 08:27:27]
here and I'm going to go ahead and

[08:27:23 - 08:27:27]
launch Studio

[08:27:32 - 08:27:36]
and from here on the left hand side I'm

[08:27:34 - 08:27:38]
making my over to Compu I mean I just

[08:27:36 - 08:27:40]
want a notebook so we can do it here as

[08:27:38 - 08:27:42]
well um it's interesting we also have

[08:27:40 - 08:27:44]
model catalog here um but you know

[08:27:42 - 08:27:46]
there's just multiple ways of doing the

[08:27:44 - 08:27:49]
exact same thing so we'll go ahead and

[08:27:46 - 08:27:51]
create ourselves compute here uh Android

[08:27:49 - 08:27:54]
one is totally fine I just want CPUs I

[08:27:51 - 08:27:56]
want the lowest cost possible um from

[08:27:54 - 08:27:57]
all options

[08:27:56 - 08:28:01]
as we're not doing anything crazy here

[08:27:57 - 08:28:04]
so we use our standard DS DS1 version

[08:28:01 - 08:28:05]
two idle shut down after 60 minutes is

[08:28:04 - 08:28:08]
fine with me we'll go ahead review

[08:28:05 - 08:28:11]
create I'll go ahead and create

[08:28:08 - 08:28:13]
that so now I'm just waiting for um this

[08:28:11 - 08:28:15]
environment to provision I go compute

[08:28:13 - 08:28:17]
down here and we'll just wait for that

[08:28:15 - 08:28:18]
okay all right so that is now running

[08:28:17 - 08:28:21]
we're going to go ahead and click on

[08:28:18 - 08:28:23]
Jupiter lab and that's going to bring up

[08:28:21 - 08:28:29]
a Jupiter lab environment so we'll just

[08:28:23 - 08:28:29]
give that a moment uh to get going

[08:28:32 - 08:28:38]
there there we go so um we're not doing

[08:28:36 - 08:28:41]
anything crazy

[08:28:38 - 08:28:44]
here so I'm going to go with

[08:28:41 - 08:28:46]
um SD version 2 I'm not sure what the

[08:28:44 - 08:28:48]
the two is for I'm going to just check

[08:28:46 - 08:28:50]
uh click python IP kernel so we're just

[08:28:48 - 08:28:55]
using standard python here let's make

[08:28:50 - 08:28:57]
our way over to that code over here and

[08:28:55 - 08:28:58]
I'm going just grab this link as you

[08:28:57 - 08:29:00]
folks might be wondering how do you get

[08:28:58 - 08:29:03]
it later on cuz I will I'll take this

[08:29:00 - 08:29:07]
one and I'll actually put it in the

[08:29:03 - 08:29:10]
um I will place it in the um

[08:29:07 - 08:29:11]
um you know Whatchamacallit um I

[08:29:10 - 08:29:12]
actually want mark down there that's

[08:29:11 - 08:29:14]
fine I'm just going to switch that out

[08:29:12 - 08:29:15]
here to markdown and then I'll bring

[08:29:14 - 08:29:18]
this one up this one is actually code

[08:29:15 - 08:29:20]
and let's see if we can get this to work

[08:29:18 - 08:29:22]
apis are always changing folks you got

[08:29:20 - 08:29:24]
to keep up with

[08:29:22 - 08:29:25]
them okay I was just doing this three

[08:29:24 - 08:29:27]
months ago and it's completely different

[08:29:25 - 08:29:29]
experience so here it says you can use

[08:29:27 - 08:29:30]
the project clients to configure stuff

[08:29:29 - 08:29:32]
here so we'll go ahead we have chat

[08:29:30 - 08:29:34]
completion embeddings client we want to

[08:29:32 - 08:29:35]
do chat completion here today so I'm

[08:29:34 - 08:29:38]
going to go ahead and grab this

[08:29:35 - 08:29:41]
code okay and actually we just happen to

[08:29:38 - 08:29:43]
be using gp40 so that's perfect for

[08:29:41 - 08:29:44]
us um but you know again the reason

[08:29:43 - 08:29:46]
we're not using openi we're using this

[08:29:44 - 08:29:50]
one is that this one uh can utilize

[08:29:46 - 08:29:52]
multiple multiple ones here um here we

[08:29:50 - 08:29:54]
need the

[08:29:52 - 08:29:57]
project uh okay where does that come

[08:29:54 - 08:29:57]
from

[08:29:58 - 08:30:04]
so we need to bring

[08:30:01 - 08:30:04]
in

[08:30:05 - 08:30:09]
[Music]

[08:30:10 - 08:30:16]
this okay so we'll try this one second

[08:30:14 - 08:30:18]
here I'm going to go ahead and just

[08:30:16 - 08:30:21]
bring this onto a single line like this

[08:30:18 - 08:30:24]
here and we'll

[08:30:21 - 08:30:27]
run okay so that's

[08:30:24 - 08:30:30]
good and then I'll bring this down a

[08:30:27 - 08:30:32]
line create a project in client code we

[08:30:30 - 08:30:34]
already have a project right so we don't

[08:30:32 - 08:30:38]
need another

[08:30:34 - 08:30:41]
project but we need to load a project so

[08:30:38 - 08:30:45]
here it says project your connection

[08:30:41 - 08:30:45]
string create a project in the client

[08:30:46 - 08:30:50]
[Music]

[08:30:48 - 08:30:52]
code copy the project connection uh

[08:30:50 - 08:30:53]
string from the overview page so I'm I

[08:30:52 - 08:30:55]
don't think it's creating one it's

[08:30:53 - 08:30:57]
saying like you already have one and so

[08:30:55 - 08:30:58]
you're bringing in here so I'm going to

[08:30:57 - 08:31:00]
go ahead and I'm just going to paste

[08:30:58 - 08:31:02]
this in here and so if we go back over

[08:31:00 - 08:31:05]
to

[08:31:02 - 08:31:06]
um yeah thei playground if we go to

[08:31:05 - 08:31:09]
overview

[08:31:06 - 08:31:12]
here we have a connection string right

[08:31:09 - 08:31:14]
here okay so I'm going to bring that in

[08:31:12 - 08:31:17]
here I'm going to dump it in like

[08:31:14 - 08:31:20]
that um that looks fine I'm going to go

[08:31:17 - 08:31:21]
ahead and hit play here says oh um I

[08:31:20 - 08:31:24]
didn't import those we'll go back over

[08:31:21 - 08:31:26]
to this we'll bring this here and I'll

[08:31:24 - 08:31:28]
bring this down

[08:31:26 - 08:31:30]
apologize for the fonts I just realized

[08:31:28 - 08:31:30]
it was too

[08:31:31 - 08:31:36]
small we'll bring it down we'll hit

[08:31:34 - 08:31:38]
play okay and then we'll just go ahead

[08:31:36 - 08:31:41]
and hit run

[08:31:38 - 08:31:43]
here now we didn't authenticate in any

[08:31:41 - 08:31:45]
way so I'm not exactly sure how that's

[08:31:43 - 08:31:46]
going to work but uh we'll find out here

[08:31:45 - 08:31:48]
in a second assuming this is not going

[08:31:46 - 08:31:50]
to work but if it does that's

[08:31:48 - 08:31:51]
great oh it worked okay great I just

[08:31:50 - 08:31:53]
thought there'd be more like there was

[08:31:51 - 08:31:57]
like a popup or something but maybe

[08:31:53 - 08:32:00]
because we're in here it's totally fine

[08:31:57 - 08:32:01]
um yeah it just worked that's great okay

[08:32:00 - 08:32:04]
so here we are

[08:32:01 - 08:32:05]
getting back output so that's perfect

[08:32:04 - 08:32:08]
I'm going to go ahead and just clear

[08:32:05 - 08:32:12]
this out here one

[08:32:08 - 08:32:15]
second um and your

[08:32:12 - 08:32:17]
string uh this will just be basic and I

[08:32:15 - 08:32:19]
just want to go ahead and clear all

[08:32:17 - 08:32:21]
cells I don't want to run everything I

[08:32:19 - 08:32:24]
just want to clear the

[08:32:21 - 08:32:26]
cells I'll stop

[08:32:24 - 08:32:28]
here clear all outputs there we go clear

[08:32:26 - 08:32:30]
all outputs there we go and so I'll go

[08:32:28 - 08:32:32]
ahead and download this one so this is

[08:32:30 - 08:32:35]
another one that's useful for our repo

[08:32:32 - 08:32:37]
here now I didn't do one for

[08:32:35 - 08:32:41]
um uh what do you call it

[08:32:37 - 08:32:44]
uh this is azure AI

[08:32:41 - 08:32:45]
Foundry I didn't do one for uh Google

[08:32:44 - 08:32:47]
just because the code was so

[08:32:45 - 08:32:48]
straightforward and I mean they gave us

[08:32:47 - 08:32:49]
the code so I wasn't going to just

[08:32:48 - 08:32:52]
change

[08:32:49 - 08:32:56]
it but this one's a little bit different

[08:32:52 - 08:32:57]
so we'll have to do a bit more work here

[08:32:56 - 08:32:59]
oh sorry you know what I'm still

[08:32:57 - 08:33:02]
recording this video oh no it's not the

[08:32:59 - 08:33:05]
video I want it's what it's the file

[08:33:02 - 08:33:06]
let's try to name the file that I I uh

[08:33:05 - 08:33:08]
the video is recording right here and so

[08:33:06 - 08:33:10]
we'll bring this into Azure Foundry I'm

[08:33:08 - 08:33:14]
going to rename this here so it's just

[08:33:10 - 08:33:16]
basic okay and so now we have our two so

[08:33:14 - 08:33:18]
we'll go ahead

[08:33:16 - 08:33:21]
and just Azure AI

[08:33:18 - 08:33:24]
Foundry I don't want all the stuff in

[08:33:21 - 08:33:26]
here though I told it to go

[08:33:24 - 08:33:27]
away uh

[08:33:26 - 08:33:28]
I mean the first one's here that's not a

[08:33:27 - 08:33:30]
big deal I just want want to make sure

[08:33:28 - 08:33:32]
that connection string was in here I

[08:33:30 - 08:33:34]
want to just clear this out C all cell

[08:33:32 - 08:33:36]
outputs there we go and that's good so

[08:33:34 - 08:33:38]
we'll go

[08:33:36 - 08:33:41]
ahead I don't need all caps I think I

[08:33:38 - 08:33:43]
just hit the Caps Key by ACC AI

[08:33:41 - 08:33:46]
Foundry

[08:33:43 - 08:33:48]
um that is good we'll go ahead and save

[08:33:46 - 08:33:52]
that and so that is um the easiest way

[08:33:48 - 08:33:53]
to get working with Azure AI Foundry uh

[08:33:52 - 08:33:55]
that model is deployed I'm not going to

[08:33:53 - 08:33:57]
undeploy it you can if you are

[08:33:55 - 08:33:59]
uncomfortable with that um but if you

[08:33:57 - 08:34:02]
want to get rid of that you absolutely

[08:33:59 - 08:34:05]
can um so you could go ahead and delete

[08:34:02 - 08:34:08]
that I suppose I could delete it or un

[08:34:05 - 08:34:08]
undeploy

[08:34:10 - 08:34:13]
it where is

[08:34:13 - 08:34:18]
it how do we undeploy

[08:34:18 - 08:34:21]
this

[08:34:24 - 08:34:30]
edit usually was like a delete

[08:34:27 - 08:34:30]
button

[08:34:31 - 08:34:36]
H that's interesting what if we go to

[08:34:33 - 08:34:36]
the model

[08:34:37 - 08:34:42]
catalog yeah that's not very clear I

[08:34:40 - 08:34:45]
going to go up to uh maybe Azure founder

[08:34:42 - 08:34:46]
I'm going to go up a level into a

[08:34:45 - 08:34:47]
project I really don't like this

[08:34:46 - 08:34:49]
interface I prefer the well I mean it's

[08:34:47 - 08:34:51]
very similar to Azure Studio opening ey

[08:34:49 - 08:34:53]
Studio but I can't say I'm a huge fan of

[08:34:51 - 08:34:55]
this go back over to models here what if

[08:34:53 - 08:34:56]
we go to data I don't think there's any

[08:34:55 - 08:35:02]
data that's

[08:34:56 - 08:35:05]
models checkbox how do I undeploy a

[08:35:02 - 08:35:09]
model OKAY Azure AI Studio I'm going to

[08:35:05 - 08:35:11]
write Studio because it's uh undeploy a

[08:35:09 - 08:35:13]
model select deploy model page then

[08:35:11 - 08:35:16]
select deploy me one delete and delete

[08:35:13 - 08:35:19]
it

[08:35:16 - 08:35:22]
uhhuh deploy model

[08:35:19 - 08:35:24]
page what to delete a deployment within

[08:35:22 - 08:35:26]
the language Studio no that's language

[08:35:24 - 08:35:31]
Studio

[08:35:26 - 08:35:34]
um yeah Azure a portal Foundry deploying

[08:35:31 - 08:35:34]
models how do you

[08:35:36 - 08:35:39]
undeploy

[08:35:43 - 08:35:49]
delete okay let me go find it okay this

[08:35:46 - 08:35:51]
is typical Azure for you I found it what

[08:35:49 - 08:35:52]
you do is you click into the model and

[08:35:51 - 08:35:54]
then you can delete it there so I'm just

[08:35:52 - 08:35:56]
going to delete it just in case people

[08:35:54 - 08:35:58]
are worried okay and so now that model

[08:35:56 - 08:35:59]
is deleted I'm going to keep Azure a

[08:35:58 - 08:36:03]
Foundry this project around we'll use it

[08:35:59 - 08:36:05]
again for Azure ml um I'm going to get

[08:36:03 - 08:36:08]
rid of that instance that I'm running I

[08:36:05 - 08:36:11]
could just stop it if I wanted to but

[08:36:08 - 08:36:14]
um uh yeah I'm under compute here so I

[08:36:11 - 08:36:16]
could stop it I just delete it here it's

[08:36:14 - 08:36:17]
not that it's not that much work to spin

[08:36:16 - 08:36:20]
one up when we need one and so there you

[08:36:17 - 08:36:22]
go that is working with Azure AI Foundry

[08:36:20 - 08:36:25]
at the most basic way programmatically

[08:36:22 - 08:36:25]
and so I'll see you in the next one okay

[08:36:25 - 08:36:30]
ciao

[08:36:25 - 08:36:31]
[Music]

[08:36:30 - 08:36:33]
hey this is Andrew Brown and we're

[08:36:31 - 08:36:35]
taking a look at hugging face so you've

[08:36:33 - 08:36:38]
never used hugging face before it is

[08:36:35 - 08:36:40]
awesome because it contains models data

[08:36:38 - 08:36:43]
sets and more but hugging face is not

[08:36:40 - 08:36:45]
just a website a repository for things

[08:36:43 - 08:36:47]
but they also have a series of plugins

[08:36:45 - 08:36:50]
that make it really easy to work with

[08:36:47 - 08:36:52]
models and so you're absolutely going to

[08:36:50 - 08:36:55]
learn uh definitely learn about a bunch

[08:36:52 - 08:36:56]
of the different types of hugging face

[08:36:55 - 08:36:59]
um things and so you can see we have

[08:36:56 - 08:37:01]
Transformers diffusers data sets these

[08:36:59 - 08:37:02]
are other libraries that you can utilize

[08:37:01 - 08:37:05]
right so we have a bunch and bunch of

[08:37:02 - 08:37:09]
libraries and then there's hugging face

[08:37:05 - 08:37:11]
itself right um so what I'd like to do

[08:37:09 - 08:37:13]
is maybe download a model and play with

[08:37:11 - 08:37:14]
something here but anyway make make

[08:37:13 - 08:37:17]
yourself an account once you have your

[08:37:14 - 08:37:19]
account uh you're good uh often what

[08:37:17 - 08:37:20]
we'll have to do is set tokens so I'm

[08:37:19 - 08:37:22]
not sure if I have any access tokens

[08:37:20 - 08:37:25]
around here right now it wants me to log

[08:37:22 - 08:37:26]
in so just give me a moment there we go

[08:37:25 - 08:37:29]
I'm in my hugging face account I'm going

[08:37:26 - 08:37:31]
to go ahead and delete my key for now

[08:37:29 - 08:37:33]
and this is some something that you'll

[08:37:31 - 08:37:35]
have to do a lot is create a key uh to

[08:37:33 - 08:37:37]
work with models but we'll come back to

[08:37:35 - 08:37:39]
this just in a moment as what I want to

[08:37:37 - 08:37:42]
do is look at some possible models that

[08:37:39 - 08:37:44]
we could uh work with so if we click on

[08:37:42 - 08:37:46]
models here you can see there is a lot

[08:37:44 - 08:37:48]
right now we are specifically interested

[08:37:46 - 08:37:50]
in large language models but there are

[08:37:48 - 08:37:52]
other of course other ones that we might

[08:37:50 - 08:37:54]
be interested in uh but you can see

[08:37:52 - 08:37:56]
there's just tons and tons because there

[08:37:54 - 08:37:58]
are base models foundational models and

[08:37:56 - 08:38:00]
then people train these models to do

[08:37:58 - 08:38:02]
other things so you can end up with a

[08:38:00 - 08:38:03]
lot of stuff you wouldn't expect but

[08:38:02 - 08:38:06]
what's interesting here we have like

[08:38:03 - 08:38:08]
text to 3D I don't know much about that

[08:38:06 - 08:38:12]
um but that might be uh fun to uh give

[08:38:08 - 08:38:14]
it a go at some point here um but yeah

[08:38:12 - 08:38:16]
it's really hard to tell like what's a

[08:38:14 - 08:38:18]
big deal and what's not but I guess you

[08:38:16 - 08:38:21]
can go here like the most downloads it

[08:38:18 - 08:38:25]
looks like open AI shape e is a is a

[08:38:21 - 08:38:27]
very popular one here um and I think I

[08:38:25 - 08:38:28]
already have access to this model as

[08:38:27 - 08:38:30]
they've already accepted stuff but a lot

[08:38:28 - 08:38:32]
of times when you work with

[08:38:30 - 08:38:33]
models like let's say we go over to

[08:38:32 - 08:38:36]
Intel

[08:38:33 - 08:38:40]
here um not that one but some of these

[08:38:36 - 08:38:42]
will expect you to accept terms so I'm

[08:38:40 - 08:38:44]
I'm just trying to find one where I

[08:38:42 - 08:38:47]
haven't already done this before so if I

[08:38:44 - 08:38:50]
go to here and I want to use this model

[08:38:47 - 08:38:51]
it's not happening right now but anyway

[08:38:50 - 08:38:53]
sometimes you have to accept the terms

[08:38:51 - 08:38:55]
and so you have to look very carefully

[08:38:53 - 08:38:57]
here and make sure that you accept the

[08:38:55 - 08:38:58]
terms before you use them otherwise they

[08:38:57 - 08:38:59]
won't let you use them and there can be

[08:38:58 - 08:39:01]
a waiting period I'm just sorry that I

[08:38:59 - 08:39:03]
can't show you that directly but with

[08:39:01 - 08:39:05]
hugging face sometimes they have options

[08:39:03 - 08:39:07]
on how you can deploy models now this

[08:39:05 - 08:39:09]
one is all we have is

[08:39:07 - 08:39:12]
diffusers um but with other ones that

[08:39:09 - 08:39:17]
are maybe um uh different if we go back

[08:39:12 - 08:39:20]
over to here let's go to something like

[08:39:17 - 08:39:23]
um natural language processing so let's

[08:39:20 - 08:39:25]
say we went text classification

[08:39:23 - 08:39:28]
here right um

[08:39:25 - 08:39:31]
and we choose anything here we have more

[08:39:28 - 08:39:33]
options right so here we have options on

[08:39:31 - 08:39:34]
how we can deploy it how we can train it

[08:39:33 - 08:39:36]
how we might use the models with

[08:39:34 - 08:39:38]
specific libraries so if I click to this

[08:39:36 - 08:39:41]
it'll give me exact code on how we could

[08:39:38 - 08:39:43]
work with this um and so this is

[08:39:41 - 08:39:44]
something that we could utilize but I'm

[08:39:43 - 08:39:46]
just going to go here and take a look

[08:39:44 - 08:39:47]
here as deploy can sometimes be useful

[08:39:46 - 08:39:49]
because if you're trying to figure out

[08:39:47 - 08:39:51]
what amount of compute you need

[08:39:49 - 08:39:53]
sometimes they'll tell you in here but

[08:39:51 - 08:39:54]
as you can see there isn't much

[08:39:53 - 08:39:57]
information so they don't have anything

[08:39:54 - 08:39:59]
for this one but we go over to let's say

[08:39:57 - 08:40:01]
sage maker and you carefully look here

[08:39:59 - 08:40:04]
they might tell you that this is using

[08:40:01 - 08:40:07]
an ml M5 x large and then you could look

[08:40:04 - 08:40:09]
that up and say okay what size is this

[08:40:07 - 08:40:11]
this uh this thing

[08:40:09 - 08:40:16]
here right so go here and I'm going to

[08:40:11 - 08:40:16]
look for that model ml m5x

[08:40:16 - 08:40:23]
large and uh you know as per

[08:40:20 - 08:40:27]
usual it us say UI is terrible I don't

[08:40:23 - 08:40:27]
want run pod get out of here runp pod

[08:40:28 - 08:40:35]
um I just want to know how large it is

[08:40:31 - 08:40:35]
come on you can find it for

[08:40:36 - 08:40:41]
me that's an ml M5 it's going to be an

[08:40:38 - 08:40:44]
M5 x large so that's going to have four

[08:40:41 - 08:40:45]
vcpus 16 uh gigabits but then if we want

[08:40:44 - 08:40:48]
to look up the cost we'd have to look up

[08:40:45 - 08:40:51]
pricing for that right so this again is

[08:40:48 - 08:40:52]
exactly how we would do it on Sage maker

[08:40:51 - 08:40:54]
if there was a jump start we could do it

[08:40:52 - 08:40:57]
that way if we wanted to use inferia and

[08:40:54 - 08:41:01]
Trum we do it that way so the code is

[08:40:57 - 08:41:03]
available to us uh Google Cloud um

[08:41:01 - 08:41:04]
apparently it just opens up another Tab

[08:41:03 - 08:41:05]
and doesn't show us anything but we'll

[08:41:04 - 08:41:08]
get that sidebar with all our

[08:41:05 - 08:41:09]
information in it and we have a certain

[08:41:08 - 08:41:11]
amount that we could deploy so this is

[08:41:09 - 08:41:12]
something that we could deploy this way

[08:41:11 - 08:41:15]
so it's like single click deploy which

[08:41:12 - 08:41:17]
is really really nice sometimes it works

[08:41:15 - 08:41:19]
sometimes it doesn't um obviously

[08:41:17 - 08:41:20]
training but if we look at Transformers

[08:41:19 - 08:41:23]
that might be another way that we could

[08:41:20 - 08:41:26]
utilize it but anyway let's go over and

[08:41:23 - 08:41:28]
use something practical so llama 3.2 two

[08:41:26 - 08:41:30]
assuming that is still available 1B is a

[08:41:28 - 08:41:31]
very good starting model and the reason

[08:41:30 - 08:41:34]
why it's a good starting model is that

[08:41:31 - 08:41:36]
it's very small so you can run it on

[08:41:34 - 08:41:39]
most machines

[08:41:36 - 08:41:40]
um but uh or even on on computes so this

[08:41:39 - 08:41:43]
is something that I think I'd like to

[08:41:40 - 08:41:46]
work with here today um I'm just trying

[08:41:43 - 08:41:48]
to decide um where to run this uh

[08:41:46 - 08:41:49]
because I want it to work for everybody

[08:41:48 - 08:41:50]
so maybe what we should do is try to

[08:41:49 - 08:41:52]
deploy it to

[08:41:50 - 08:41:55]
something

[08:41:52 - 08:41:59]
um and

[08:41:55 - 08:42:00]
M maybe we can use lightning AI today

[08:41:59 - 08:42:03]
that's what I'm going to do so let's go

[08:42:00 - 08:42:03]
make our way over to lightning

[08:42:03 - 08:42:09]
AI

[08:42:06 - 08:42:10]
okay just because it's so easy to start

[08:42:09 - 08:42:13]
working with it and they probably

[08:42:10 - 08:42:15]
already have a llama 3.2 one here but I

[08:42:13 - 08:42:17]
just want to get started from scratch so

[08:42:15 - 08:42:20]
I'm going to go up to here and I just

[08:42:17 - 08:42:23]
want to launch myself the studio now the

[08:42:20 - 08:42:26]
UI is a little bit all over the place

[08:42:23 - 08:42:28]
but I'm going to go to my studio

[08:42:26 - 08:42:30]
started a project from a template I

[08:42:28 - 08:42:32]
don't want to start from a template I

[08:42:30 - 08:42:33]
just want to start creating so the

[08:42:32 - 08:42:35]
wording is a little bit funny let's go

[08:42:33 - 08:42:37]
to home maybe here we go and so now I

[08:42:35 - 08:42:40]
can go ahead and start a new studio and

[08:42:37 - 08:42:42]
we have code and we have a model

[08:42:40 - 08:42:45]
language um so let's go ahead and hit

[08:42:42 - 08:42:47]
start I don't have it defaults to gpus I

[08:42:45 - 08:42:48]
wanted to start on CPUs but we'll see

[08:42:47 - 08:42:52]
what happens here in just a

[08:42:48 - 08:42:55]
moment so it's on CPUs which is fine um

[08:42:52 - 08:42:57]
but with llama 3.2 we do need gpus

[08:42:55 - 08:42:59]
actually if we want to work with this

[08:42:57 - 08:43:00]
but we're going to start with CPUs

[08:42:59 - 08:43:03]
first okay and we're going to let this

[08:43:00 - 08:43:06]
environment spin up okay all right so

[08:43:03 - 08:43:08]
our lightning environment is up and so

[08:43:06 - 08:43:10]
uh you can work in a jupyter notebook or

[08:43:08 - 08:43:12]
in

[08:43:10 - 08:43:16]
here how do I want to work with this

[08:43:12 - 08:43:20]
today I think I will work

[08:43:16 - 08:43:20]
in uh Jupiter I think I prefer Jupiter

[08:43:20 - 08:43:22]
here

[08:43:20 - 08:43:24]
today so it's up to you you can either

[08:43:22 - 08:43:27]
or it's the same compute but I'm going

[08:43:24 - 08:43:28]
to switch over to that Al have tensor

[08:43:27 - 08:43:30]
board here on the on the left hand side

[08:43:28 - 08:43:32]
so I'm going to go ahead and make myself

[08:43:30 - 08:43:33]
a new notebook for Python 3 and I'm

[08:43:32 - 08:43:35]
going to rename this

[08:43:33 - 08:43:38]
[Music]

[08:43:35 - 08:43:42]
to hugging face Basics so hugging

[08:43:38 - 08:43:44]
hugging face HF basic just so we know

[08:43:42 - 08:43:45]
what that is and so we'll start working

[08:43:44 - 08:43:46]
with this so how can we work with this

[08:43:45 - 08:43:49]
model well first you have to accept the

[08:43:46 - 08:43:51]
terms so see it says gated model you

[08:43:49 - 08:43:53]
have been granted access so be very

[08:43:51 - 08:43:55]
careful and and do this CU I've seen

[08:43:53 - 08:43:56]
people where they think they've got it

[08:43:55 - 08:43:58]
but they actually really haven't done it

[08:43:56 - 08:44:00]
yet and so this is where we can start

[08:43:58 - 08:44:02]
programmatically um working with this

[08:44:00 - 08:44:06]
model so we go over here we have

[08:44:02 - 08:44:08]
Transformers and VM so VM is um a way of

[08:44:06 - 08:44:10]
serving a model but Transformers is

[08:44:08 - 08:44:14]
another way so here's suggesting that we

[08:44:10 - 08:44:16]
use the hunging face Li to log in um so

[08:44:14 - 08:44:18]
login with a HF token with a gated

[08:44:16 - 08:44:20]
access permission I suppose that's one

[08:44:18 - 08:44:21]
way I'm just going to provide the token

[08:44:20 - 08:44:23]
directly as that is another way for us

[08:44:21 - 08:44:27]
to do it but I'm going to go ahead and

[08:44:23 - 08:44:28]
grab this code here and I go back over

[08:44:27 - 08:44:30]
to here and so that'll be the first

[08:44:28 - 08:44:32]
thing I'm going to have to go above here

[08:44:30 - 08:44:35]
and we're going to have to do a pip uh

[08:44:32 - 08:44:38]
pip

[08:44:35 - 08:44:38]
install

[08:44:38 - 08:44:43]
Transformers okay so that's going

[08:44:41 - 08:44:45]
to could not find a version of the

[08:44:43 - 08:44:47]
package that satisfies Transformers I

[08:44:45 - 08:44:51]
probably spelled it

[08:44:47 - 08:44:52]
wrong there we go why they call it

[08:44:51 - 08:44:54]
hugging face Transformers I don't know

[08:44:52 - 08:44:55]
really is confusing they're they're

[08:44:54 - 08:44:59]
naming here if you don't like all the

[08:44:55 - 08:45:00]
stuff there you could do hyphen q and it

[08:44:59 - 08:45:03]
will still install but it'll just be

[08:45:00 - 08:45:06]
less noisy um so we have that we do need

[08:45:03 - 08:45:07]
to set our hugging face API key so that

[08:45:06 - 08:45:10]
is something that we'll need to set I'm

[08:45:07 - 08:45:13]
going to make my way um over here in a

[08:45:10 - 08:45:15]
new tab so I'm going go here and then go

[08:45:13 - 08:45:16]
to access tokens I'm going to create a

[08:45:15 - 08:45:19]
new token set it to read and this is

[08:45:16 - 08:45:21]
just going to be HF example and I'm

[08:45:19 - 08:45:26]
going to create that token and so now I

[08:45:21 - 08:45:28]
have a token so there's a hugging face

[08:45:26 - 08:45:33]
uh

[08:45:28 - 08:45:33]
endpoint it's like hugging face

[08:45:33 - 08:45:38]
um I mean I've never tried the hugging

[08:45:36 - 08:45:40]
the hugging facei it's not that I've

[08:45:38 - 08:45:41]
never tried it but it's been a while so

[08:45:40 - 08:45:43]
I'm actually just curious if we were to

[08:45:41 - 08:45:45]
use that but hugging facei I found was

[08:45:43 - 08:45:48]
kind of a pain to install so I'm not

[08:45:45 - 08:45:51]
sure we could try

[08:45:48 - 08:45:53]
it yeah so we have this so I'm going to

[08:45:51 - 08:45:55]
grabb it here I don't trust running it

[08:45:53 - 08:45:57]
in

[08:45:55 - 08:45:59]
um in this context I'm going to go ahead

[08:45:57 - 08:46:01]
and make a new

[08:45:59 - 08:46:05]
terminal

[08:46:01 - 08:46:08]
here and I'm going to paste it

[08:46:05 - 08:46:10]
here I'm going to type in clear does

[08:46:08 - 08:46:13]
this have cond installed it

[08:46:10 - 08:46:14]
does um but I'm not sure if we are doing

[08:46:13 - 08:46:16]
that in that context because all these

[08:46:14 - 08:46:18]
environments are in different context

[08:46:16 - 08:46:19]
right but we only have the one here so

[08:46:18 - 08:46:21]
I'm

[08:46:19 - 08:46:23]
assuming it's already set to that one

[08:46:21 - 08:46:26]
I'm not sure or what we could do before

[08:46:23 - 08:46:28]
we do that was just do cond

[08:46:26 - 08:46:30]
list maybe will tell us no that's not it

[08:46:28 - 08:46:33]
cond

[08:46:30 - 08:46:36]
EnV cond I'm assuming it's using cond

[08:46:33 - 08:46:39]
underneath I just want to see what um

[08:46:36 - 08:46:39]
environments we have we have

[08:46:40 - 08:46:45]
packages

[08:46:42 - 08:46:46]
uh just show me what possible

[08:46:45 - 08:46:49]
environments we have I'm not sure why

[08:46:46 - 08:46:49]
it's so hard to

[08:46:52 - 08:46:56]
find oh right maybe the environment is

[08:46:54 - 08:46:58]
like a local

[08:46:56 - 08:47:00]
thing okay well anyway I think it's

[08:46:58 - 08:47:01]
using Python 3 here and we did install

[08:47:00 - 08:47:04]
that there so let's go ahead and just

[08:47:01 - 08:47:07]
see if it works if it doesn't we'll just

[08:47:04 - 08:47:07]
circle back and do something

[08:47:09 - 08:47:14]
else okay but this is not usually the

[08:47:12 - 08:47:16]
way the way I like to do it but I'm just

[08:47:14 - 08:47:18]
trying something different for a change

[08:47:16 - 08:47:21]
so it says enter your token here okay so

[08:47:18 - 08:47:25]
we'll go ahead and grab

[08:47:21 - 08:47:27]
it uh from here copy of course use your

[08:47:25 - 08:47:29]
own token don't take mine I'm going to

[08:47:27 - 08:47:33]
delete mine anyway so you're not going

[08:47:29 - 08:47:36]
to get it hit enter add token as git

[08:47:33 - 08:47:38]
credential uh sure I don't

[08:47:36 - 08:47:42]
know so canot authenticate get

[08:47:38 - 08:47:42]
credential as no helpers defining your

[08:47:42 - 08:47:49]
machine uh sure okay there we go we'll

[08:47:47 - 08:47:51]
try this again I'm going to go ahead and

[08:47:49 - 08:47:52]
I realize this is small so I'm just

[08:47:51 - 08:47:56]
going to bump it up a little bit I'm

[08:47:52 - 08:47:57]
going to go and grab this again

[08:47:56 - 08:48:00]
we'll copy it we'll go back over to here

[08:47:57 - 08:48:03]
we'll paste it in we'll hit enter we'll

[08:48:00 - 08:48:05]
say yes and now it says it's active Okay

[08:48:03 - 08:48:06]
so just because it works in here does

[08:48:05 - 08:48:09]
not necessarily mean it will work in

[08:48:06 - 08:48:10]
here and so this just really has to do

[08:48:09 - 08:48:12]
again with this environment and whether

[08:48:10 - 08:48:14]
I'm actually in the same context as this

[08:48:12 - 08:48:16]
environment but I don't know where that

[08:48:14 - 08:48:18]
environment is uh usually when you have

[08:48:16 - 08:48:20]
cond will do parentheses and tell you

[08:48:18 - 08:48:21]
but this looks like it's a bit modified

[08:48:20 - 08:48:23]
so I can't really tell what's going on I

[08:48:21 - 08:48:25]
guess I could type in cond info and see

[08:48:23 - 08:48:27]
what I get

[08:48:25 - 08:48:29]
and so oh it's telling us where it is

[08:48:27 - 08:48:30]
it's right here okay so this is the

[08:48:29 - 08:48:33]
environment that is activated called

[08:48:30 - 08:48:35]
Cloud space um not exactly the same name

[08:48:33 - 08:48:39]
as

[08:48:35 - 08:48:42]
here but it might be okay so I guess

[08:48:39 - 08:48:45]
we'll see but anyway uh what we have

[08:48:42 - 08:48:46]
here is we have the Transformers and

[08:48:45 - 08:48:49]
then we are making a pipeline we have

[08:48:46 - 08:48:51]
text generation meta llama 3.21 billion

[08:48:49 - 08:48:53]
so this should download the model right

[08:48:51 - 08:48:56]
so if I hit play here this should

[08:48:53 - 08:48:58]
download the model

[08:48:56 - 08:49:00]
okay if we go down here we might get a

[08:48:58 - 08:49:00]
problem

[08:49:01 - 08:49:06]
about cannot Grant access so it doesn't

[08:49:04 - 08:49:07]
think it's set right and so this is this

[08:49:06 - 08:49:11]
is what I mean where I'm having a little

[08:49:07 - 08:49:13]
bit of an issue so

[08:49:11 - 08:49:19]
um oh I always forget how to do let's go

[08:49:13 - 08:49:22]
ask chat BT how do I load an N an nvar

[08:49:19 - 08:49:26]
[Music]

[08:49:22 - 08:49:27]
into uh Jupiter Labs cuz I I I imagine

[08:49:26 - 08:49:30]
we could make like aemv file and load it

[08:49:27 - 08:49:30]
that

[08:49:30 - 08:49:34]
way yeah that's one

[08:49:36 - 08:49:42]
way so that's what I was thinking that's

[08:49:39 - 08:49:42]
another

[08:49:42 - 08:49:46]
way and there's

[08:49:46 - 08:49:51]
[Music]

[08:49:49 - 08:49:53]
EnV yeah I feel like that's a little bit

[08:49:51 - 08:49:57]
more safe so I'm going to go ahead with

[08:49:53 - 08:50:02]
that and and we'll go back over to I

[08:49:57 - 08:50:03]
suppose here and I'm just going to grab

[08:50:02 - 08:50:04]
that and put that there as well we'll

[08:50:03 - 08:50:06]
hit play and that that'll install both

[08:50:04 - 08:50:09]
of

[08:50:06 - 08:50:10]
them okay and then I'm going to go back

[08:50:09 - 08:50:13]
over to

[08:50:10 - 08:50:15]
here and we need our EMV so we'll go

[08:50:13 - 08:50:18]
ahead and make

[08:50:15 - 08:50:21]
that uh new

[08:50:18 - 08:50:21]
file

[08:50:22 - 08:50:28]
dotv um I'll rename this here so

[08:50:25 - 08:50:28]
dmv.

[08:50:29 - 08:50:35]
txt and we'll look for hugging

[08:50:32 - 08:50:39]
face

[08:50:35 - 08:50:41]
um hugging face and VAR because it'll

[08:50:39 - 08:50:44]
have a very specific

[08:50:41 - 08:50:48]
name that it can

[08:50:44 - 08:50:48]
load API

[08:50:50 - 08:50:55]
key HF token that's what it is okay so

[08:50:53 - 08:50:58]
I'm going to go back over to here

[08:50:55 - 08:51:00]
again trying to do it in a way that's

[08:50:58 - 08:51:04]
safe okay and then I'm going to go ahead

[08:51:00 - 08:51:06]
and grab my hugging face API key

[08:51:04 - 08:51:07]
here and if somebody smarter than me and

[08:51:06 - 08:51:09]
thinks there's a better way happy to

[08:51:07 - 08:51:13]
hear it but we'll save that there and so

[08:51:09 - 08:51:15]
I want to load that specific uh like a

[08:51:13 - 08:51:17]
very specific file so go back over to

[08:51:15 - 08:51:18]
chat GPT

[08:51:17 - 08:51:24]
here

[08:51:18 - 08:51:26]
um okay what if the file is called .txt

[08:51:24 - 08:51:30]
can I load

[08:51:26 - 08:51:30]
that cuz there's probably a way to do

[08:51:39 - 08:51:44]
that there we go so this is what I need

[08:51:42 - 08:51:44]
so we'll grab

[08:51:45 - 08:51:48]
this

[08:51:46 - 08:51:51]
[Music]

[08:51:48 - 08:51:53]
and yeah so we'll grab this

[08:51:51 - 08:51:56]
here I'll go back over to here and I'm

[08:51:53 - 08:51:58]
just going to bring this down

[08:51:56 - 08:52:00]
one and we'll run

[08:51:58 - 08:52:02]
that and then we'll run this again and

[08:52:00 - 08:52:04]
so now it's downloading the model okay

[08:52:02 - 08:52:06]
and so understand that when we are

[08:52:04 - 08:52:08]
downloading models it's good to be in

[08:52:06 - 08:52:09]
the CPU mode here um but then when we

[08:52:08 - 08:52:12]
want to actually do inference we're

[08:52:09 - 08:52:16]
going to probably want gpus um if you

[08:52:12 - 08:52:20]
had a very special type of CPU like

[08:52:16 - 08:52:23]
Intel lunar lake or uh a metal chip they

[08:52:20 - 08:52:24]
have igpus built in um so I would just

[08:52:23 - 08:52:27]
say that we'll probably switch over to

[08:52:24 - 08:52:30]
gpus when we want to start using this

[08:52:27 - 08:52:32]
but you might have a machine that's not

[08:52:30 - 08:52:34]
necessarily using the gpus but using the

[08:52:32 - 08:52:36]
igpus and we're not necessarily

[08:52:34 - 08:52:38]
utilizing those here today um this

[08:52:36 - 08:52:40]
actually could probably work with like a

[08:52:38 - 08:52:42]
Zeon processor so if we had like a xon 4

[08:52:40 - 08:52:45]
skillable processor with enough CPU we

[08:52:42 - 08:52:47]
could technically uh utilize it that way

[08:52:45 - 08:52:48]
um but there's no harm we can try to run

[08:52:47 - 08:52:53]
it and see if it works if it works with

[08:52:48 - 08:52:55]
four four uh CPUs with 16 gbits of ram

[08:52:53 - 08:52:57]
that's fine as well but you know we're

[08:52:55 - 08:53:00]
not going to get the best performance so

[08:52:57 - 08:53:03]
again we're letting that model

[08:53:00 - 08:53:05]
download it's going good device set to

[08:53:03 - 08:53:08]
use CPU which is totally fine because we

[08:53:05 - 08:53:12]
are utilizing CPUs right now so I'm

[08:53:08 - 08:53:13]
going to go back over to here and we

[08:53:12 - 08:53:16]
have a bit of code here so load the

[08:53:13 - 08:53:18]
model

[08:53:16 - 08:53:22]
directly so actually this would probably

[08:53:18 - 08:53:23]
download the model what did this do then

[08:53:22 - 08:53:25]
safe tensor no no it's downloading the

[08:53:23 - 08:53:27]
stuff right here here okay where it

[08:53:25 - 08:53:28]
downloaded I don't know so it it

[08:53:27 - 08:53:31]
definitely downloaded it here and so

[08:53:28 - 08:53:33]
then we have the tokenizer and the model

[08:53:31 - 08:53:35]
um so go ahead and grab

[08:53:33 - 08:53:36]
that we'll paste this in it shouldn't

[08:53:35 - 08:53:39]
download it

[08:53:36 - 08:53:42]
twice Auto tokenizer is not defined

[08:53:39 - 08:53:43]
because we didn't import it oh sorry so

[08:53:42 - 08:53:46]
this we can either do it this way or

[08:53:43 - 08:53:48]
that way okay sorry so um some like I

[08:53:46 - 08:53:50]
often do it this way like load the all

[08:53:48 - 08:53:52]
directly but here we're using the

[08:53:50 - 08:53:54]
pipeline um so let's read the highle

[08:53:52 - 08:53:57]
pipeline documentation

[08:53:54 - 08:53:59]
and see how this might work so we have

[08:53:57 - 08:54:01]
the

[08:53:59 - 08:54:04]
pipe and then we can provide something

[08:54:01 - 08:54:06]
here so let's go ahead and grab

[08:54:04 - 08:54:07]
that

[08:54:06 - 08:54:10]
okay that's why I was getting a little

[08:54:07 - 08:54:13]
bit mixed up so go ahead and run it like

[08:54:10 - 08:54:16]
this it would say set padding ID and EOS

[08:54:13 - 08:54:18]
token ID for open and generation it

[08:54:16 - 08:54:19]
still worked um so this I think has

[08:54:18 - 08:54:22]
something to do with uh embeddings or

[08:54:19 - 08:54:24]
tokenization and so uh there's some kind

[08:54:22 - 08:54:26]
of underlying file we might have to

[08:54:24 - 08:54:28]
tweak but but it clearly still generated

[08:54:26 - 08:54:29]
out it says this restaurant is awesome

[08:54:28 - 08:54:31]
the food is delicious and the service is

[08:54:29 - 08:54:35]
great the only downside is in the

[08:54:31 - 08:54:37]
location I wouldn't so we provided some

[08:54:35 - 08:54:39]
text and then it went to a certain

[08:54:37 - 08:54:40]
degree uh but let's go take a look and

[08:54:39 - 08:54:42]
see if we can learn a little bit more

[08:54:40 - 08:54:45]
about pipelines so pipelines are a great

[08:54:42 - 08:54:48]
way to ensure models for

[08:54:45 - 08:54:49]
inference okay um the pipeline

[08:54:48 - 08:54:51]
abstraction is a wrapper around all of

[08:54:49 - 08:54:53]
their available pipelines which makes

[08:54:51 - 08:54:55]
sense and so here we're doing text

[08:54:53 - 08:54:57]
classification

[08:54:55 - 08:54:59]
uh but what did we do we did um text

[08:54:57 - 08:55:02]
generation so we have different types of

[08:54:59 - 08:55:04]
pipelines there so what might be

[08:55:02 - 08:55:05]
interesting is to find out exactly where

[08:55:04 - 08:55:07]
that information is for the different

[08:55:05 - 08:55:09]
types of pipelines uh the text is really

[08:55:07 - 08:55:10]
hard to read here on the right hand side

[08:55:09 - 08:55:12]
I'm going just blow it up I'm not sure

[08:55:10 - 08:55:16]
why they make it like super

[08:55:12 - 08:55:18]
gray but I'm going to zoom out here I'm

[08:55:16 - 08:55:20]
imagining

[08:55:18 - 08:55:21]
that that pipeline is this one right

[08:55:20 - 08:55:23]
here so if we click into

[08:55:21 - 08:55:25]
this right this is the pipeline I think

[08:55:23 - 08:55:29]
we're

[08:55:25 - 08:55:32]
izing okay so we have pipeline yep and

[08:55:29 - 08:55:33]
then we have generator they just named

[08:55:32 - 08:55:35]
instead of name it pipe then named it

[08:55:33 - 08:55:38]
generator based on what it

[08:55:35 - 08:55:39]
is okay and so that's an example of it

[08:55:38 - 08:55:42]
working there I was hoping that we could

[08:55:39 - 08:55:44]
see a little bit more about the

[08:55:42 - 08:55:47]
parameters which I don't

[08:55:44 - 08:55:47]
see but that's totally fine another

[08:55:47 - 08:55:49]
thing we could do is we could switch

[08:55:47 - 08:55:52]
over to summarization pipeline maybe so

[08:55:49 - 08:55:55]
maybe we could try that for a

[08:55:52 - 08:55:57]
second the summarization

[08:55:55 - 08:55:59]
Pipeline and so I'll scroll on down and

[08:55:57 - 08:56:02]
so here what we could do is switch this

[08:55:59 - 08:56:05]
out let's just see if this

[08:56:02 - 08:56:07]
works and I'm going to go back over to

[08:56:05 - 08:56:08]
here and we'll scroll up and so I'm

[08:56:07 - 08:56:12]
going to switch this out

[08:56:08 - 08:56:13]
to summarization right I'm just guessing

[08:56:12 - 08:56:15]
I'm not really following well I guess it

[08:56:13 - 08:56:18]
has it right here so I'm not necessarily

[08:56:15 - 08:56:21]
guessing and we have a few parameters

[08:56:18 - 08:56:24]
here so grab that

[08:56:21 - 08:56:27]
there and

[08:56:24 - 08:56:29]
go ahead and run it shouldn't download

[08:56:27 - 08:56:29]
the model

[08:56:32 - 08:56:37]
twice that's fine so it says the model

[08:56:35 - 08:56:38]
llama for casual ELO is not supported

[08:56:37 - 08:56:41]
for summarization so there are very

[08:56:38 - 08:56:42]
specific models that can perform these

[08:56:41 - 08:56:46]
things and so it's just saying you

[08:56:42 - 08:56:49]
cannot use the LA metal llama llama 3.2

[08:56:46 - 08:56:52]
1 billion um so we'd have to use

[08:56:49 - 08:56:54]
something else so here we can see we

[08:56:52 - 08:56:56]
have Bart for conditional big

[08:56:54 - 08:56:58]
Pegasus I'm not familiar with both of

[08:56:56 - 08:57:01]
these models but let's go ahead and see

[08:56:58 - 08:57:04]
if we can uh figure out what these are

[08:57:01 - 08:57:05]
so I might go here just see if I can

[08:57:04 - 08:57:09]
search for

[08:57:05 - 08:57:09]
this uh let's go over to

[08:57:10 - 08:57:14]
here as I'm not again not very familiar

[08:57:13 - 08:57:17]
with

[08:57:14 - 08:57:19]
these hugging face Mario model let's go

[08:57:17 - 08:57:22]
here Mario mty

[08:57:19 - 08:57:24]
model and we found it over here so it

[08:57:22 - 08:57:26]
says so we have a bunch of models here

[08:57:24 - 08:57:28]
that are kind of directly supported

[08:57:26 - 08:57:29]
these are text models a framer for

[08:57:28 - 08:57:32]
translation

[08:57:29 - 08:57:33]
models using the same models as Bart

[08:57:32 - 08:57:36]
translation should be similar but not

[08:57:33 - 08:57:39]
identical to

[08:57:36 - 08:57:42]
it okay and so here we are using the

[08:57:39 - 08:57:42]
model this

[08:57:44 - 08:57:50]
way but I'm curious I wonder what would

[08:57:48 - 08:57:54]
happen Okay because we went to the

[08:57:50 - 08:57:54]
summarization pipeline

[08:57:54 - 08:57:59]
and I wonder if I can just well here

[08:57:57 - 08:58:01]
they're actually using the Google T5

[08:57:59 - 08:58:03]
base which is

[08:58:01 - 08:58:04]
fine but I'm almost wondering if I could

[08:58:03 - 08:58:07]
just drop in the Martin

[08:58:04 - 08:58:10]
one um so let's go

[08:58:07 - 08:58:11]
here and I'm going to just try this it

[08:58:10 - 08:58:13]
might not work whatsoever but I'm going

[08:58:11 - 08:58:13]
to try

[08:58:14 - 08:58:18]
anyway it's probably say I don't know

[08:58:16 - 08:58:18]
what you're talking

[08:58:20 - 08:58:24]
about is not a local folder or

[08:58:22 - 08:58:26]
identified there yeah yeah I figured as

[08:58:24 - 08:58:30]
much so maybe it's just ones that are

[08:58:26 - 08:58:32]
compatible with that right so let's see

[08:58:30 - 08:58:34]
if chat GPT can help us so you know I

[08:58:32 - 08:58:37]
want

[08:58:34 - 08:58:39]
to in the summarization

[08:58:37 - 08:58:41]
pipeline in hugging

[08:58:39 - 08:58:44]
face okay let's see if it can figure it

[08:58:41 - 08:58:44]
out for

[08:58:44 - 08:58:50]
us it just says that we can do it okay

[08:58:47 - 08:58:50]
so it says this for translation

[08:58:52 - 08:58:56]
tasks mhm

[08:58:59 - 08:59:02]
okay so here is the

[08:59:04 - 08:59:07]
model and that's what I was looking for

[08:59:06 - 08:59:10]
so I didn't I didn't really read the

[08:59:07 - 08:59:10]
rest of that I didn't really

[08:59:12 - 08:59:15]
care and again I'm just going to point

[08:59:14 - 08:59:17]
out I'm not an expert in this stuff it's

[08:59:15 - 08:59:18]
just like you kind of start figuring out

[08:59:17 - 08:59:22]
what to copy and paste and what doesn't

[08:59:18 - 08:59:24]
work the to cannot be in uh in uh

[08:59:22 - 08:59:26]
instantiated please make sure you have S

[08:59:24 - 08:59:28]
sentence piece installed to use this

[08:59:26 - 08:59:30]
tokenizer so I'm going to go up here and

[08:59:28 - 08:59:31]
just add it this again often what

[08:59:30 - 08:59:34]
happens is that I have to constantly do

[08:59:31 - 08:59:35]
this stuff uh the current process just

[08:59:34 - 08:59:39]
got

[08:59:35 - 08:59:42]
forked okay whatever and I'm going to go

[08:59:39 - 08:59:45]
ahead and try this again so run this

[08:59:42 - 08:59:47]
again and hugging face tokenizers the

[08:59:45 - 08:59:48]
current process just got forked after

[08:59:47 - 08:59:51]
parallelism has been already used

[08:59:48 - 08:59:53]
disable parallelism to avoid Deadlocks

[08:59:51 - 08:59:54]
sounds like something I wouldn't want to

[08:59:53 - 08:59:57]
happen

[08:59:54 - 08:59:58]
the tokenizer cannot be uh instantiated

[08:59:57 - 09:00:00]
please make sure you have sentence piece

[08:59:58 - 09:00:01]
installed in order to use the tokenizer

[09:00:00 - 09:00:03]
so sometimes when you have issues you

[09:00:01 - 09:00:05]
need to restart so I'm going to say

[09:00:03 - 09:00:06]
restart

[09:00:05 - 09:00:09]
kernel

[09:00:06 - 09:00:12]
okay and I'm just going to run this

[09:00:09 - 09:00:14]
again and then this one again and then

[09:00:12 - 09:00:17]
this one

[09:00:14 - 09:00:20]
again let's see if we can kind of get

[09:00:17 - 09:00:23]
this working so here it says um

[09:00:20 - 09:00:25]
recommend using Saros I don't know what

[09:00:23 - 09:00:30]
that is let's go take a

[09:00:25 - 09:00:32]
look it is what

[09:00:30 - 09:00:34]
um it looks like it's a

[09:00:32 - 09:00:38]
tokenizer and it looks like more like

[09:00:34 - 09:00:41]
scare Mo Moses looks like scare Moses

[09:00:38 - 09:00:44]
now that saying SC

[09:00:41 - 09:00:47]
Moses that is going to be something

[09:00:44 - 09:00:47]
there so I'll do that we'll restart the

[09:00:52 - 09:00:55]
kernel okay again don't know what I'm

[09:00:54 - 09:00:57]
doing but I'm getting it to work and

[09:00:55 - 09:00:59]
that's all that really matters I mean

[09:00:57 - 09:01:01]
you should know a little bit more but

[09:00:59 - 09:01:03]
now I'm not getting errors this is not

[09:01:01 - 09:01:05]
really a good summarization uh task so

[09:01:03 - 09:01:07]
I'm going to go ahead here can you can

[09:01:05 - 09:01:12]
you give me a

[09:01:07 - 09:01:12]
large amount of text for

[09:01:12 - 09:01:16]
summarization okay

[09:01:31 - 09:01:34]
and it goes and goes and

[09:01:37 - 09:01:43]
[Music]

[09:01:40 - 09:01:45]
goes good so I'm going to grab this text

[09:01:43 - 09:01:47]
right and we're going to bring it on

[09:01:45 - 09:01:51]
over uh to here and so this is going to

[09:01:47 - 09:01:52]
be my big big amount of text that's a

[09:01:51 - 09:01:57]
lot of

[09:01:52 - 09:01:57]
junk um I do not need all those

[09:01:57 - 09:02:00]
lines

[09:01:58 - 09:02:02]
um but I don't care I'm just going to

[09:02:00 - 09:02:05]
let it be like that because I can't even

[09:02:02 - 09:02:07]
see what I'm doing so run that see if

[09:02:05 - 09:02:07]
that

[09:02:07 - 09:02:10]
works un terminate string literal I knew

[09:02:09 - 09:02:13]
it was going to do something weird like

[09:02:10 - 09:02:13]
that so I'm going to go here to the

[09:02:15 - 09:02:20]
end yeah was having a little bit of

[09:02:17 - 09:02:20]
problems here

[09:02:29 - 09:02:31]
and so something it doesn't like

[09:02:30 - 09:02:34]
something in

[09:02:31 - 09:02:36]
here because you can see that it's not

[09:02:34 - 09:02:39]
terminating correctly right so I just

[09:02:36 - 09:02:39]
keep bringing it on to the next line

[09:02:52 - 09:02:56]
here it's oh now it's highlighting

[09:02:55 - 09:02:58]
properly excellent so probably just the

[09:02:56 - 09:03:02]
way I did multi-line so your max length

[09:02:58 - 09:03:06]
is 512 uh but your input is only

[09:03:02 - 09:03:07]
452 since it's a summarization where um

[09:03:06 - 09:03:09]
where do it

[09:03:07 - 09:03:10]
says with output shorter than input or

[09:03:09 - 09:03:13]
typically wanted you might consider

[09:03:10 - 09:03:15]
decreasing the the max length Okay but

[09:03:13 - 09:03:16]
it did go ahead and it attempted a

[09:03:15 - 09:03:19]
summarization now it is doing something

[09:03:16 - 09:03:21]
funny where it's showing French however

[09:03:19 - 09:03:23]
if you look at the model it says empty

[09:03:21 - 09:03:25]
English to French and so you know this

[09:03:23 - 09:03:27]
mod model is intended for translation

[09:03:25 - 09:03:30]
English to French now we were using it

[09:03:27 - 09:03:32]
here right but it's kind of interesting

[09:03:30 - 09:03:34]
that it did produce French in this case

[09:03:32 - 09:03:36]
so that kind of makes sense we can go

[09:03:34 - 09:03:39]
down here and maybe let's use the Google

[09:03:36 - 09:03:40]
T5 T5 base I'm not sure how large that

[09:03:39 - 09:03:42]
one here it's suggesting that it uses

[09:03:40 - 09:03:44]
the tensorflow framework and it has to

[09:03:42 - 09:03:46]
use this tokenizer so I'm going to go

[09:03:44 - 09:03:47]
ahead and grab it here and I'm going to

[09:03:46 - 09:03:50]
paste it

[09:03:47 - 09:03:53]
in okay let's go run

[09:03:50 - 09:03:56]
this and pipel can on for suitable mod

[09:03:53 - 09:03:57]
class class for T5 Bas so not sure why

[09:03:56 - 09:03:59]
that's happening so I'm going to go back

[09:03:57 - 09:04:02]
to this so this is not a obviously a

[09:03:59 - 09:04:03]
very good example for translation but

[09:04:02 - 09:04:05]
let's go over to here maybe they have

[09:04:03 - 09:04:06]
one for translation they have a

[09:04:05 - 09:04:10]
translation

[09:04:06 - 09:04:11]
pipeline okay so let's just go this

[09:04:10 - 09:04:13]
one's English to

[09:04:11 - 09:04:15]
French this one's English to French this

[09:04:13 - 09:04:17]
might be perfect is this one using the

[09:04:15 - 09:04:19]
one that we're using no not necessarily

[09:04:17 - 09:04:22]
and so I'm going to switch this out to

[09:04:19 - 09:04:25]
here okay so we're going to take all

[09:04:22 - 09:04:25]
this text out of here now

[09:04:25 - 09:04:30]
holy smokes that's long okay and I'm

[09:04:28 - 09:04:33]
just going to go down like

[09:04:30 - 09:04:35]
this and for those who know I'm in

[09:04:33 - 09:04:38]
Canada and yes we do speak French here

[09:04:35 - 09:04:44]
but not so much myself I'll say hello

[09:04:38 - 09:04:46]
how is your day going today right and so

[09:04:44 - 09:04:52]
I'm going to go ahead and hit run

[09:04:46 - 09:04:52]
here and then we'll do this

[09:04:54 - 09:04:59]
uhour

[09:04:57 - 09:05:02]
a oh I don't know how to say that but

[09:04:59 - 09:05:04]
anyway so you know we have that there

[09:05:02 - 09:05:07]
and so that is

[09:05:04 - 09:05:09]
pipelines um do I like pipelines they're

[09:05:07 - 09:05:11]
okay but they do standardize stuff to a

[09:05:09 - 09:05:12]
certain degree there are all sorts of

[09:05:11 - 09:05:14]
pipelines like natural language

[09:05:12 - 09:05:17]
processing we got multimodal ones and

[09:05:14 - 09:05:19]
things like that um but you know there

[09:05:17 - 09:05:21]
are other ways that we might use it at a

[09:05:19 - 09:05:23]
at a lower level uh for hugging face

[09:05:21 - 09:05:24]
we're going to do more with hugging face

[09:05:23 - 09:05:27]
but I'm just going going to stop the

[09:05:24 - 09:05:29]
video here um you can stop this

[09:05:27 - 09:05:30]
environment whenever you want uh by

[09:05:29 - 09:05:33]
going back over to here I'm not going to

[09:05:30 - 09:05:34]
stop it because I want to continue on

[09:05:33 - 09:05:36]
but I just want to give us a checkpoint

[09:05:34 - 09:05:38]
here uh for this yeah so if you want to

[09:05:36 - 09:05:39]
stop that you can just sleep it or

[09:05:38 - 09:05:43]
delete it if you really need to get rid

[09:05:39 - 09:05:46]
of you can just delete it um and I

[09:05:43 - 09:05:47]
suppose I could export this code in its

[09:05:46 - 09:05:48]
current state if anybody wants to play

[09:05:47 - 09:05:51]
around with this I'm going to go ahead

[09:05:48 - 09:05:54]
and download this and we're going to

[09:05:51 - 09:05:55]
bring it into our

[09:05:54 - 09:05:57]
repo but we're just going to keep

[09:05:55 - 09:05:59]
playing around hugging face because

[09:05:57 - 09:06:00]
there's so much to do in here and I'm

[09:05:59 - 09:06:02]
just not even sure what to show you

[09:06:00 - 09:06:05]
there's so much um so I'm going to just

[09:06:02 - 09:06:09]
bring this into here for

[09:06:05 - 09:06:14]
now hugging face

[09:06:09 - 09:06:17]
right and I'll see you here shortly here

[09:06:14 - 09:06:20]
[Music]

[09:06:17 - 09:06:24]
okay welcome back we're continuing to

[09:06:20 - 09:06:27]
learn about hugging face uh we used the

[09:06:24 - 09:06:29]
um uh we used a pipeline and so there

[09:06:27 - 09:06:31]
are different ways that obviously we can

[09:06:29 - 09:06:33]
work with models and so pipelines is one

[09:06:31 - 09:06:34]
of them but what I want to do is go back

[09:06:33 - 09:06:36]
over to here to hugging face and I'm

[09:06:34 - 09:06:37]
going to again continue to focus on

[09:06:36 - 09:06:40]
llama

[09:06:37 - 09:06:42]
3.2 um and see what else we can do with

[09:06:40 - 09:06:44]
it so we went here and went to

[09:06:42 - 09:06:46]
Transformers and so we used a pipeline

[09:06:44 - 09:06:48]
which is this one which way this way

[09:06:46 - 09:06:51]
there's another way where we can

[09:06:48 - 09:06:53]
directly load a model um and so this

[09:06:51 - 09:06:54]
might be a way that we might want to

[09:06:53 - 09:06:56]
work with it so I'm going to go ahead

[09:06:54 - 09:06:57]
and copy this and I'm going to go back

[09:06:56 - 09:06:59]
over to lightning AI which I still have

[09:06:57 - 09:07:01]
running with our CPUs I'm going to go

[09:06:59 - 09:07:04]
ahead and make a new file here new

[09:07:01 - 09:07:06]
notebook this will be HF I really should

[09:07:04 - 09:07:09]
name this one pipelines but that's fine

[09:07:06 - 09:07:10]
and we'll rename this one to HF uh

[09:07:09 - 09:07:12]
direct

[09:07:10 - 09:07:14]
model okay so I'm going to go ahead and

[09:07:12 - 09:07:16]
paste this but I'm not exactly sure how

[09:07:14 - 09:07:18]
to fill the rest in here as I I normally

[09:07:16 - 09:07:20]
have a basis of code that I work with I

[09:07:18 - 09:07:22]
tweak it from there but let's go ahead

[09:07:20 - 09:07:24]
and see if chat GPT can help us out so

[09:07:22 - 09:07:26]
we'll say

[09:07:24 - 09:07:28]
um you know what we should try to use

[09:07:26 - 09:07:29]
other models we should just use chat GPT

[09:07:28 - 09:07:31]
every day so I'm going to go ahead and

[09:07:29 - 09:07:33]
go over to

[09:07:31 - 09:07:38]
Gemini and I'll just say uh you know I

[09:07:33 - 09:07:40]
want to run uh I want to uh have chat

[09:07:38 - 09:07:45]
with

[09:07:40 - 09:07:49]
uh with with uh llama

[09:07:45 - 09:07:51]
3.2 but I need to complete the

[09:07:49 - 09:07:52]
code and if I see the code then I I'll

[09:07:51 - 09:07:54]
be like okay yeah that's what it's

[09:07:52 - 09:07:56]
supposed to look like

[09:07:54 - 09:07:59]
wow that was fast that was really really

[09:07:56 - 09:08:00]
fast that was really really fast um and

[09:07:59 - 09:08:02]
I guess we're on flash so that kind of

[09:08:00 - 09:08:04]
makes sense and so here we have

[09:08:02 - 09:08:06]
Transformers the same lines and so we

[09:08:04 - 09:08:09]
have some python down here here's how

[09:08:06 - 09:08:11]
you can complete the code okay so here

[09:08:09 - 09:08:14]
we could set the setting to GPU or Aruda

[09:08:11 - 09:08:16]
actually that looks pretty good um and

[09:08:14 - 09:08:17]
it would default to CPU so actually I'm

[09:08:16 - 09:08:21]
really happy with

[09:08:17 - 09:08:24]
that um so we'll go back over to

[09:08:21 - 09:08:26]
here okay but I I think it if you didn't

[09:08:24 - 09:08:29]
specify anything it would just fall back

[09:08:26 - 09:08:30]
to that sometimes I see numbers here

[09:08:29 - 09:08:33]
instead so instead of Cuda and GPU it

[09:08:30 - 09:08:35]
might be zero and one uh and one might

[09:08:33 - 09:08:38]
be CPUs for some weird reason then down

[09:08:35 - 09:08:40]
below we have a function okay so let's

[09:08:38 - 09:08:43]
go ahead and copy this and see what we

[09:08:40 - 09:08:45]
have go down here and I'm going to break

[09:08:43 - 09:08:48]
this up into three functions I think

[09:08:45 - 09:08:50]
that's a little bit better okay and so

[09:08:48 - 09:08:51]
we have our function where it's going to

[09:08:50 - 09:08:54]
generate text and so we have the

[09:08:51 - 09:08:54]
tokenizer

[09:08:54 - 09:09:00]
okay yeah because when you have an llm

[09:08:57 - 09:09:03]
or a model you need to uh tokenize it

[09:09:00 - 09:09:04]
before you put it into the class okay so

[09:09:03 - 09:09:08]
that makes

[09:09:04 - 09:09:10]
sense and then we have model generate so

[09:09:08 - 09:09:12]
we're calling do generate on a model so

[09:09:10 - 09:09:16]
if we looked up maybe like

[09:09:12 - 09:09:18]
Auto auto auto model for casual llm if

[09:09:16 - 09:09:20]
we looked at this probably yeah we have

[09:09:18 - 09:09:21]
Auto classes so in many cases the

[09:09:20 - 09:09:24]
architecture you want can be used and

[09:09:21 - 09:09:26]
guess from the name or path of pre train

[09:09:24 - 09:09:29]
model okay so we have

[09:09:26 - 09:09:30]
that what I'm looking for here is it's

[09:09:29 - 09:09:35]
just the functions like generate and

[09:09:30 - 09:09:39]
things like that so do we have generate

[09:09:35 - 09:09:40]
here um I mean suggesting that it's in

[09:09:39 - 09:09:42]
here

[09:09:40 - 09:09:44]
somewhere generate generate generate

[09:09:42 - 09:09:44]
generate

[09:09:46 - 09:09:50]
generate uh or am I just in Auto classes

[09:09:49 - 09:09:55]
hold on here I'm just in regular Auto

[09:09:50 - 09:09:55]
classes I want this one in particular

[09:09:55 - 09:10:03]
um this one here okay and so what I'm

[09:10:00 - 09:10:06]
looking for here this is hugging face uh

[09:10:03 - 09:10:08]
API somewhere else so we can configure

[09:10:06 - 09:10:10]
it

[09:10:08 - 09:10:13]
m

[09:10:10 - 09:10:14]
okay but where does that generate thing

[09:10:13 - 09:10:16]
come in

[09:10:14 - 09:10:18]
play from

[09:10:16 - 09:10:21]
pre-trained because maybe yeah you have

[09:10:18 - 09:10:21]
the model here

[09:10:22 - 09:10:25]
right and

[09:10:25 - 09:10:29]
and then we can call functions on it

[09:10:27 - 09:10:32]
like generate but where does that come

[09:10:29 - 09:10:34]
from so let's go back over to Gemini

[09:10:32 - 09:10:38]
it's like where does where does the

[09:10:34 - 09:10:38]
generate function come

[09:10:42 - 09:10:46]
from the generary function is powerful

[09:10:44 - 09:10:48]
okay great but I can't find it okay but

[09:10:46 - 09:10:52]
where let's go here and see it might

[09:10:48 - 09:10:52]
have a docs for us

[09:10:54 - 09:10:56]
there it is text

[09:10:56 - 09:11:01]
generation each framework has a generate

[09:10:59 - 09:11:05]
method for text

[09:11:01 - 09:11:07]
generation okay so basically whatever

[09:11:05 - 09:11:10]
it's so there's different Frameworks

[09:11:07 - 09:11:12]
like P torch tensorflow flax Jacks and

[09:11:10 - 09:11:15]
so I guess the idea is that it's mapping

[09:11:12 - 09:11:18]
to that one underneath with a generic

[09:11:15 - 09:11:19]
one there I still don't understand how

[09:11:18 - 09:11:21]
it's getting there but I at least kind

[09:11:19 - 09:11:24]
of have an idea of it so that's totally

[09:11:21 - 09:11:26]
fine I I think this is going to work

[09:11:24 - 09:11:27]
um and then we can set it have the max

[09:11:26 - 09:11:30]
amount of tokens and things like that so

[09:11:27 - 09:11:31]
I'm going to go ahead and give this a

[09:11:30 - 09:11:33]
run so

[09:11:31 - 09:11:35]
we'll do I have to install anything

[09:11:33 - 09:11:39]
probably Transformers at least right so

[09:11:35 - 09:11:39]
we'll do pip install

[09:11:39 - 09:11:42]
Transformers it might already be in our

[09:11:41 - 09:11:45]
environment but I'm going to go ahead

[09:11:42 - 09:11:46]
and run this again anyway and by the way

[09:11:45 - 09:11:47]
like when you're working on dramatically

[09:11:46 - 09:11:50]
different things you probably would want

[09:11:47 - 09:11:52]
to spin up a separate Studio as when

[09:11:50 - 09:11:54]
you're working locally with code You'

[09:11:52 - 09:11:56]
often spin up a separate uh cond

[09:11:54 - 09:11:57]
environment right I'm gonna go down here

[09:11:56 - 09:12:00]
and again I'm just going to silence

[09:11:57 - 09:12:02]
silence this as this is kind of annoying

[09:12:00 - 09:12:04]
and then we'll run the next one so it's

[09:12:02 - 09:12:05]
going to download llama 3.21 billion we

[09:12:04 - 09:12:07]
actually already have it downloaded from

[09:12:05 - 09:12:08]
the pipeline before so I'm assuming it

[09:12:07 - 09:12:12]
will go the same place we can actually

[09:12:08 - 09:12:14]
tell it where to download by the way um

[09:12:12 - 09:12:15]
if we wanted to put in a very specific

[09:12:14 - 09:12:16]
folder and that's something you might

[09:12:15 - 09:12:18]
want to do and we probably will do it

[09:12:16 - 09:12:20]
some later point because when you're

[09:12:18 - 09:12:23]
working with containers uh you need to

[09:12:20 - 09:12:25]
place it somewhere outside the container

[09:12:23 - 09:12:27]
and so and also just it's good to know

[09:12:25 - 09:12:28]
exactly where you have it so I I prefer

[09:12:27 - 09:12:31]
to explicitly say where it's going to go

[09:12:28 - 09:12:32]
so I can see the files um but really

[09:12:31 - 09:12:35]
what it's doing is it's literally

[09:12:32 - 09:12:37]
downloading the contents of this so if

[09:12:35 - 09:12:38]
we were to specify where to download it

[09:12:37 - 09:12:41]
I think that we would see that maybe we

[09:12:38 - 09:12:45]
could uh ask it to do that we'll go back

[09:12:41 - 09:12:47]
here uh to Gemini uh can we change the

[09:12:45 - 09:12:52]
code so we can say

[09:12:47 - 09:12:53]
exactly where the model should be

[09:12:52 - 09:12:58]
downloaded cuz I don't want to feel like

[09:12:53 - 09:13:00]
how how to find that here and yeah so

[09:12:58 - 09:13:02]
here yeah are we just specifying cash is

[09:13:00 - 09:13:04]
that what it is Cash directory and so

[09:13:02 - 09:13:08]
here what we could

[09:13:04 - 09:13:10]
do is grab this here I said we' do it

[09:13:08 - 09:13:12]
later but let's just do it

[09:13:10 - 09:13:15]
now and the path I want to put it here

[09:13:12 - 09:13:15]
is just like um

[09:13:18 - 09:13:21]
models okay and I'll just make a new

[09:13:20 - 09:13:24]
folder here called

[09:13:21 - 09:13:26]
models this should

[09:13:24 - 09:13:29]
relative I'm not sure if I could just do

[09:13:26 - 09:13:32]
this and say like period slash like that

[09:13:29 - 09:13:34]
um this says model path so I'm not sure

[09:13:32 - 09:13:37]
if we should put llama within it or this

[09:13:34 - 09:13:40]
going to be a single model

[09:13:37 - 09:13:40]
um okay

[09:13:40 - 09:13:48]
so is this a path to a generic models or

[09:13:46 - 09:13:50]
should I have a

[09:13:48 - 09:13:52]
folder with the model

[09:13:50 - 09:13:55]
name I don't like how they didn't give

[09:13:52 - 09:13:58]
me a concrete

[09:13:55 - 09:13:58]
example if you don't specify

[09:13:59 - 09:14:04]
folder okay so maybe we'll try this

[09:14:06 - 09:14:11]
here

[09:14:08 - 09:14:13]
right and so let's do this because I

[09:14:11 - 09:14:15]
wanted to see it download

[09:14:13 - 09:14:16]
right um am I complain that the folder

[09:14:15 - 09:14:20]
doesn't

[09:14:16 - 09:14:20]
exist let's go down

[09:14:20 - 09:14:24]
here oh right right right right right

[09:14:22 - 09:14:25]
right we got to load it in so we did

[09:14:24 - 09:14:28]
this

[09:14:25 - 09:14:32]
before in this other one here and we're

[09:14:28 - 09:14:34]
going to need to bring in Python dot EnV

[09:14:32 - 09:14:37]
so we'll go up here and put this in here

[09:14:34 - 09:14:39]
and then we'll grab this put that in

[09:14:37 - 09:14:41]
there so we'll run this and then

[09:14:39 - 09:14:42]
this and it says we need to restart our

[09:14:41 - 09:14:46]
kernel let's just restart

[09:14:42 - 09:14:46]
it and we'll run it

[09:14:48 - 09:14:52]
again and I don't know if this is going

[09:14:50 - 09:14:55]
to work without that folder but oh it is

[09:14:52 - 09:14:57]
okay so if we go into here in llama 3.2

[09:14:55 - 09:14:59]
see we didn't yeah see we could have

[09:14:57 - 09:15:01]
just put in a generic

[09:14:59 - 09:15:04]
folder that's

[09:15:01 - 09:15:05]
silly yeah it didn't really understand

[09:15:04 - 09:15:06]
what I was asking for so we could have

[09:15:05 - 09:15:08]
just done

[09:15:06 - 09:15:10]
this and I'm just going to stop this

[09:15:08 - 09:15:12]
because I don't want that to uh to go

[09:15:10 - 09:15:14]
there and so I just want to go ahead and

[09:15:12 - 09:15:18]
clean this up a little

[09:15:14 - 09:15:23]
bit we'll delete this delete

[09:15:18 - 09:15:23]
delete I do not care just delete it

[09:15:25 - 09:15:30]
models delete this folder please

[09:15:32 - 09:15:37]
delete okay that's fine

[09:15:35 - 09:15:39]
um going open up terminal here we

[09:15:37 - 09:15:41]
actually can see our terminals over here

[09:15:39 - 09:15:42]
I believe that was like when I was

[09:15:41 - 09:15:46]
running before I don't want to do it

[09:15:42 - 09:15:47]
that way let's go back over to terminals

[09:15:46 - 09:15:50]
here

[09:15:47 - 09:15:53]
and maybe down here there we go so I'll

[09:15:50 - 09:15:56]
just type in LS and so I'm just going to

[09:15:53 - 09:16:00]
go into models here and I'm going to go

[09:15:56 - 09:16:02]
remove RF llama 3.2 there we go and if I

[09:16:00 - 09:16:05]
go back over to

[09:16:02 - 09:16:06]
here okay now this there we go and so

[09:16:05 - 09:16:07]
now we just have an empty models folder

[09:16:06 - 09:16:11]
that's a bit nicer we'll go ahead and

[09:16:07 - 09:16:14]
download it again this is how I would

[09:16:11 - 09:16:16]
probably work with it um it does store

[09:16:14 - 09:16:19]
it somewhere I just don't know where and

[09:16:16 - 09:16:21]
I can't be bothered to look for it but I

[09:16:19 - 09:16:23]
I like to know where my models are and

[09:16:21 - 09:16:24]
and uh it's just how I do it so we'll

[09:16:23 - 09:16:26]
we'll give a moment for this to download

[09:16:24 - 09:16:28]
and again if you're utilizing gpus if

[09:16:26 - 09:16:30]
you need them you can always switch

[09:16:28 - 09:16:32]
between CPUs and gpus here so when

[09:16:30 - 09:16:33]
you're downloading models use CPUs and

[09:16:32 - 09:16:35]
then we not go to

[09:16:33 - 09:16:37]
gpus all right so that model is done

[09:16:35 - 09:16:40]
downloading but let's go take a look at

[09:16:37 - 09:16:42]
its contents okay so we have blobs refs

[09:16:40 - 09:16:45]
snapshots we go into

[09:16:42 - 09:16:46]
here that's not really that useful we'll

[09:16:45 - 09:16:48]
go into

[09:16:46 - 09:16:50]
here okay and so this is the stuff that

[09:16:48 - 09:16:53]
you that will look a bit familiar so we

[09:16:50 - 09:16:55]
go back over to hugging phase I believe

[09:16:53 - 09:16:58]
if we look at it

[09:16:55 - 09:17:00]
here yeah it's these files we have this

[09:16:58 - 09:17:01]
the the model safe tensor flow and some

[09:17:00 - 09:17:03]
of the other

[09:17:01 - 09:17:05]
ones yeah so we have the ones that we

[09:17:03 - 09:17:07]
need it's not all of them but it's most

[09:17:05 - 09:17:08]
of them and so you know that's what we

[09:17:07 - 09:17:11]
can see here I'm not sure if we can get

[09:17:08 - 09:17:13]
info from here um we probably go to

[09:17:11 - 09:17:15]
terminal to find out but uh you know

[09:17:13 - 09:17:17]
what's really important to to note is

[09:17:15 - 09:17:18]
like how large these files are so this

[09:17:17 - 09:17:22]
is basically is the model weights if

[09:17:18 - 09:17:24]
you're using a um uh a tensor flow one

[09:17:22 - 09:17:26]
it's going to be different for for um

[09:17:24 - 09:17:28]
but this one is uh no so this is a

[09:17:26 - 09:17:30]
tensor flow model but if it's p torch it

[09:17:28 - 09:17:32]
the the format looks a bit different I

[09:17:30 - 09:17:34]
usually see bin files there's another

[09:17:32 - 09:17:36]
format for pytorch I don't know what it

[09:17:34 - 09:17:39]
is but anyway the model is now

[09:17:36 - 09:17:41]
downloaded and so we can tell it to use

[09:17:39 - 09:17:44]
Cuda if it doesn't we'll do that saying

[09:17:41 - 09:17:47]
name torch is not defined um so this is

[09:17:44 - 09:17:49]
where we'll have to include

[09:17:47 - 09:17:50]
torch okay that's P torch um I'm

[09:17:49 - 09:17:52]
actually going to put this on a separate

[09:17:50 - 09:17:54]
line just because

[09:17:52 - 09:17:56]
is a bit of a pain in the

[09:17:54 - 09:17:57]
butt and I I want to see it do all the

[09:17:56 - 09:18:00]
stuff here so I'm going to go ahead and

[09:17:57 - 09:18:02]
do that it's going to be a big old mess

[09:18:00 - 09:18:04]
um I'm going to go ahead and restart

[09:18:02 - 09:18:06]
this

[09:18:04 - 09:18:07]
kernel one thing that uh I don't wanted

[09:18:06 - 09:18:09]
to do I don't wanted to constantly

[09:18:07 - 09:18:11]
download the model that already exists

[09:18:09 - 09:18:13]
but I think that if it does exist it

[09:18:11 - 09:18:15]
won't do that so I think that's fine and

[09:18:13 - 09:18:18]
so I'm going to go back to the top here

[09:18:15 - 09:18:19]
and we'll run this one and then we'll

[09:18:18 - 09:18:21]
run this one I don't think it will

[09:18:19 - 09:18:23]
download twice will it download

[09:18:21 - 09:18:25]
twice if it does we can put code in

[09:18:23 - 09:18:28]
there to say hey don't do that but I

[09:18:25 - 09:18:30]
would expect that it would see that it's

[09:18:28 - 09:18:32]
there yes it did and now we can run this

[09:18:30 - 09:18:32]
now

[09:18:32 - 09:18:36]
torch talking about it's right

[09:18:36 - 09:18:41]
there oh torch right here okay so we

[09:18:39 - 09:18:43]
have to import it right so I'll go here

[09:18:41 - 09:18:45]
and we'll start importing our torch

[09:18:43 - 09:18:47]
import torch and torch might have

[09:18:45 - 09:18:50]
already been pre-installed I'm not

[09:18:47 - 09:18:54]
sure

[09:18:50 - 09:18:56]
uh m

[09:18:54 - 09:18:57]
okay I mean I didn't get any errors so

[09:18:56 - 09:18:59]
that's probably fine I don't know if

[09:18:57 - 09:19:01]
that's from the import torch I'm not

[09:18:59 - 09:19:03]
sure why it's printing out all that but

[09:19:01 - 09:19:05]
I'm just going to ignore that for now so

[09:19:03 - 09:19:07]
we created our function and so here we

[09:19:05 - 09:19:09]
have kind of a loop um I'm not sure if

[09:19:07 - 09:19:11]
this is going to

[09:19:09 - 09:19:13]
work because I'm not seeing it like

[09:19:11 - 09:19:14]
expecting any input from us well does

[09:19:13 - 09:19:16]
say user input here let's see what

[09:19:14 - 09:19:19]
happens okay great so we can put it user

[09:19:16 - 09:19:22]
input so here we'll just say

[09:19:19 - 09:19:24]
hello we' enter it says the intention

[09:19:22 - 09:19:26]
mask and the pad token ID were not set

[09:19:24 - 09:19:27]
as a consequent you may observe

[09:19:26 - 09:19:30]
unexpected behaviors please pass your

[09:19:27 - 09:19:33]
input attention mask to obtain reliable

[09:19:30 - 09:19:34]
results so we do get a response back

[09:19:33 - 09:19:38]
hello my name is Maddie I'm a

[09:19:34 - 09:19:41]
20-year-old and I'm living in

[09:19:38 - 09:19:45]
whoa what the heck

[09:19:41 - 09:19:47]
uh this this is screenshot worthy this

[09:19:45 - 09:19:47]
is screenshot

[09:19:49 - 09:19:54]
worthy it's like this is built for

[09:19:51 - 09:19:56]
catfishing all right so

[09:19:54 - 09:19:58]
um sorry that was just so unusual I had

[09:19:56 - 09:20:01]
to take a screenshot and just share it

[09:19:58 - 09:20:03]
with my socials because literally I did

[09:20:01 - 09:20:05]
not expect it to make up such a weird

[09:20:03 - 09:20:07]
scenario are you real let's see if it

[09:20:05 - 09:20:07]
even

[09:20:11 - 09:20:16]
knows and it is working again we don't

[09:20:14 - 09:20:18]
have a lot of CPUs here and you can see

[09:20:16 - 09:20:20]
like the ram CPUs using up here but it

[09:20:18 - 09:20:22]
works really

[09:20:20 - 09:20:24]
well I'm a real estate broker in the

[09:20:22 - 09:20:26]
state of Florida that is that is really

[09:20:24 - 09:20:28]
great so we'll go ahead here I just want

[09:20:26 - 09:20:30]
to ask it about this um sometimes you

[09:20:28 - 09:20:34]
have to tweak like this an error

[09:20:30 - 09:20:35]
get what do I do about this error this

[09:20:34 - 09:20:37]
is something I've had to solve before

[09:20:35 - 09:20:39]
and there could be like a configuration

[09:20:37 - 09:20:41]
file that we might have to tweak or it

[09:20:39 - 09:20:44]
could be just input parameters here but

[09:20:41 - 09:20:46]
this is where if you use the pipeline

[09:20:44 - 09:20:48]
there's less fiddling around but if you

[09:20:46 - 09:20:51]
use direct model control you have a lot

[09:20:48 - 09:20:53]
more um control of what you're you are

[09:20:51 - 09:20:55]
utilizing so anyway that's direct model

[09:20:53 - 09:20:57]
control I'm not sure how much more I

[09:20:55 - 09:21:00]
need to really show of this to you folks

[09:20:57 - 09:21:02]
so we'll call this one dusted and done

[09:21:00 - 09:21:03]
and then we will uh take a look at

[09:21:02 - 09:21:05]
something else that we can do on hugging

[09:21:03 - 09:21:07]
face as there is a lot that we can do on

[09:21:05 - 09:21:10]
uh with hugging face and we should learn

[09:21:07 - 09:21:11]
as much as we can as I think it's super

[09:21:10 - 09:21:14]
valuable let me just clear

[09:21:11 - 09:21:18]
out um these here if I right click here

[09:21:14 - 09:21:20]
it will say clear all uh clear all cell

[09:21:18 - 09:21:21]
outputs and right now we're working with

[09:21:20 - 09:21:24]
lightning AI but just understand that I

[09:21:21 - 09:21:25]
like to do local development as well but

[09:21:24 - 09:21:28]
just trying to give you a place where

[09:21:25 - 09:21:29]
you have reliable compute assuming that

[09:21:28 - 09:21:30]
this platform is free while you're

[09:21:29 - 09:21:33]
utilizing it but I'm going to go ahead

[09:21:30 - 09:21:37]
and download this one and we're going to

[09:21:33 - 09:21:38]
bring that on in to uh GitHub wherever

[09:21:37 - 09:21:41]
that is

[09:21:38 - 09:21:42]
here um into hugging phase and so that's

[09:21:41 - 09:21:47]
our direct

[09:21:42 - 09:21:47]
model there we go

[09:21:53 - 09:21:57]
there we

[09:21:54 - 09:21:58]
are thank you very much and I will see

[09:21:57 - 09:21:59]
you again and we'll do more with hugging

[09:21:58 - 09:22:03]
face

[09:21:59 - 09:22:05]
[Music]

[09:22:03 - 09:22:08]
okay all right let's keep doing

[09:22:05 - 09:22:12]
something here so um we've worked with

[09:22:08 - 09:22:14]
uh uh uh Transformers the library and so

[09:22:12 - 09:22:17]
that's pretty good so far with that also

[09:22:14 - 09:22:18]
we've been using with 1B so it's

[09:22:17 - 09:22:21]
actually surprising that that worked

[09:22:18 - 09:22:26]
really well for a conversation normally

[09:22:21 - 09:22:29]
you use 3.2 1B instruct and so sometimes

[09:22:26 - 09:22:31]
some apis are not going to work with the

[09:22:29 - 09:22:32]
jic 1B model and you have to use the

[09:22:31 - 09:22:37]
instruct model so if we go over here to

[09:22:32 - 09:22:41]
like instruct see llama uh

[09:22:37 - 09:22:44]
3.2 um 1B just understand that you know

[09:22:41 - 09:22:49]
if we were to use something like VM or

[09:22:44 - 09:22:51]
something like uh uh TGI it might not uh

[09:22:49 - 09:22:53]
be as Cooperative as we would like it to

[09:22:51 - 09:22:55]
be I'm not sure what options they have

[09:22:53 - 09:22:57]
over here I was just taking a look here

[09:22:55 - 09:23:00]
of what what they're showing

[09:22:57 - 09:23:02]
here oh we' got a lot of options but

[09:23:00 - 09:23:06]
anyway that's something that is kind of

[09:23:02 - 09:23:08]
interesting there um what else could we

[09:23:06 - 09:23:09]
look at here I mean we could upload

[09:23:08 - 09:23:11]
models things like that but you can also

[09:23:09 - 09:23:13]
do things like use the model directly

[09:23:11 - 09:23:15]
here on hugging face so here on the

[09:23:13 - 09:23:17]
right hand side we have inference

[09:23:15 - 09:23:20]
API um and I'm not sure what this costs

[09:23:17 - 09:23:22]
but some models are free so if I go here

[09:23:20 - 09:23:24]
say and we run this Compu here

[09:23:22 - 09:23:26]
right I didn't have to use anything I'm

[09:23:24 - 09:23:27]
just pressing the button it works and so

[09:23:26 - 09:23:29]
it's completing it so I'm not sure how

[09:23:27 - 09:23:31]
they have the compute to do this but

[09:23:29 - 09:23:32]
they are able to do it maybe because of

[09:23:31 - 09:23:34]
the way that they are doing this but

[09:23:32 - 09:23:38]
this is a cached example so I think if I

[09:23:34 - 09:23:40]
was to change say uh Andrew Brown uh is

[09:23:38 - 09:23:42]
the best cloud

[09:23:40 - 09:23:44]
instructor

[09:23:42 - 09:23:47]
because uh because and let's see if this

[09:23:44 - 09:23:47]
works

[09:23:52 - 09:23:56]
okay cool and so if we go down here

[09:23:54 - 09:23:59]
there's some pre-built examples if we

[09:23:56 - 09:24:02]
view the code um you can see we have an

[09:23:59 - 09:24:04]
example here and this is actually

[09:24:02 - 09:24:06]
directly using the AI inference hugging

[09:24:04 - 09:24:08]
face so hugging face like literally

[09:24:06 - 09:24:10]
you're hitting this and you're using

[09:24:08 - 09:24:13]
their compute to do it now do they have

[09:24:10 - 09:24:16]
pricing for this probably inference API

[09:24:13 - 09:24:18]
so look at this inference API hugging

[09:24:16 - 09:24:20]
phase huging phas is just a mess of

[09:24:18 - 09:24:22]
things so if we go over to here servess

[09:24:20 - 09:24:24]
inference

[09:24:22 - 09:24:27]
probably go to pricing

[09:24:24 - 09:24:31]
here probably somewhere here let's see

[09:24:27 - 09:24:34]
what we have uh unlimited Etc zero GPU

[09:24:31 - 09:24:38]
and Dev mode for spaces INF for end

[09:24:34 - 09:24:41]
points okay so I'm not exactly sure

[09:24:38 - 09:24:44]
exactly how the pricing works but

[09:24:41 - 09:24:45]
clearly they have inference on here with

[09:24:44 - 09:24:47]
a few different examples so if you just

[09:24:45 - 09:24:49]
wanted to use direct curl so you know

[09:24:47 - 09:24:52]
that's that's

[09:24:49 - 09:24:53]
great um and then they're talking about

[09:24:52 - 09:24:57]
about spaces I believe this is for

[09:24:53 - 09:25:01]
gradio okay so we go over to spaces

[09:24:57 - 09:25:04]
here maybe it's not let's go take a look

[09:25:01 - 09:25:04]
hugging face

[09:25:04 - 09:25:09]
spaces

[09:25:06 - 09:25:11]
okay so this looks just looks like

[09:25:09 - 09:25:13]
curation the reason I'm getting confused

[09:25:11 - 09:25:17]
is there's also a thing called gradio

[09:25:13 - 09:25:18]
spaces okay so if we type in this and

[09:25:17 - 09:25:21]
also gradio is

[09:25:18 - 09:25:23]
maintained by hugging face I believe and

[09:25:21 - 09:25:26]
so that's where I get a little bit

[09:25:23 - 09:25:28]
confused okay but let's go over here

[09:25:26 - 09:25:29]
let's see if we can even figure out

[09:25:28 - 09:25:32]
anything about

[09:25:29 - 09:25:34]
spaces discover amazing AI apps by the

[09:25:32 - 09:25:36]
community

[09:25:34 - 09:25:37]
mhm so these are the spaces we have this

[09:25:36 - 09:25:40]
week let's go ahead say let's go click

[09:25:37 - 09:25:43]
this create a new

[09:25:40 - 09:25:46]
space Oh okay space SDK all right so

[09:25:43 - 09:25:48]
this is starting to make sense okay so

[09:25:46 - 09:25:50]
streamlit gradio Docker I'm not sure

[09:25:48 - 09:25:52]
what static is I guess HTML 5 static but

[09:25:50 - 09:25:56]
it's a way I think of serving things in

[09:25:52 - 09:25:59]
a UI and so maybe spaces allows you to

[09:25:56 - 09:26:02]
utilize those that is that is

[09:25:59 - 09:26:04]
interesting okay let me go back here so

[09:26:02 - 09:26:05]
let's say we clicked into this one here

[09:26:04 - 09:26:06]
I don't know you know this is but it's

[09:26:05 - 09:26:11]
like 3D

[09:26:06 - 09:26:15]
generation ah okay so spaces clearly is

[09:26:11 - 09:26:16]
a way for you to have an interface a UI

[09:26:15 - 09:26:18]
interface and start working with it

[09:26:16 - 09:26:20]
something that's very similar to this is

[09:26:18 - 09:26:21]
like called uh was it called replicate

[09:26:20 - 09:26:22]
which we'll be looking at some other

[09:26:21 - 09:26:24]
point

[09:26:22 - 09:26:27]
so replicate is basically this where you

[09:26:24 - 09:26:30]
could go around and you find

[09:26:27 - 09:26:31]
something let's say explore here I'm

[09:26:30 - 09:26:33]
just trying to do this as a comparison

[09:26:31 - 09:26:35]
but let's say you wanted to use this one

[09:26:33 - 09:26:37]
it has an interface here and you can

[09:26:35 - 09:26:39]
just start using it but I'm not sure if

[09:26:37 - 09:26:40]
you can make your own maybe you can this

[09:26:39 - 09:26:42]
says it's

[09:26:40 - 09:26:44]
public um but yeah it looks like we're

[09:26:42 - 09:26:45]
creating interface here so upload an

[09:26:44 - 09:26:47]
image and click generate to create a 3D

[09:26:45 - 09:26:50]
asset if the image has an alpha Channel

[09:26:47 - 09:26:53]
it will be used as a mark and running on

[09:26:50 - 09:26:54]
zero I'm not sure what zero is

[09:26:53 - 09:26:58]
hugging

[09:26:54 - 09:26:58]
face zero

[09:26:58 - 09:27:03]
GPU there a new kind of hardware for

[09:27:01 - 09:27:05]
spaces what is it a shared

[09:27:03 - 09:27:07]
infrastructure that optimizes GPU usage

[09:27:05 - 09:27:09]
for AI models and demos on hugging face

[09:27:07 - 09:27:11]
okay that's kind of cool um so here we

[09:27:09 - 09:27:12]
want to generate something so I need

[09:27:11 - 09:27:15]
something like an image so I'm going to

[09:27:12 - 09:27:17]
say um trying to think of something that

[09:27:15 - 09:27:21]
is a little bit interesting

[09:27:17 - 09:27:23]
um that we could do like say like a cup

[09:27:21 - 09:27:26]
that's not that interesting but we'll go

[09:27:23 - 09:27:29]
ahead and do it anyway and

[09:27:26 - 09:27:31]
so I mean this Lego Cup's pretty

[09:27:29 - 09:27:33]
cool I'm not sure if it's going to work

[09:27:31 - 09:27:35]
for this

[09:27:33 - 09:27:41]
example okay it's also kind of

[09:27:35 - 09:27:41]
copyrighted so maybe we shouldn't do

[09:27:41 - 09:27:48]
that let's just use the standard party

[09:27:44 - 09:27:49]
cup I feel more confident with this

[09:27:48 - 09:27:51]
there we go Uline and I probably get

[09:27:49 - 09:27:53]
that because I use Uline all the time to

[09:27:51 - 09:27:57]
buy things that's where my snowsuit came

[09:27:53 - 09:27:57]
from by the way uh would be like

[09:27:57 - 09:28:01]
freezer jacket

[09:28:02 - 09:28:05]
maybe

[09:28:06 - 09:28:14]
jumpsuit this is this is exactly what I

[09:28:11 - 09:28:17]
wear okay I wear a cold storage cover

[09:28:14 - 09:28:19]
walls that is my snowsuit I'm going to

[09:28:17 - 09:28:21]
tell you best thing best thing ever

[09:28:19 - 09:28:22]
anyway so I have that image downloaded

[09:28:21 - 09:28:25]
let's go back

[09:28:22 - 09:28:27]
over

[09:28:25 - 09:28:29]
to still have this running here if I'm

[09:28:27 - 09:28:32]
not using I probably should stop it I'm

[09:28:29 - 09:28:32]
going stop this for

[09:28:34 - 09:28:39]
now sleep for now yeah say yes sleep and

[09:28:38 - 09:28:42]
I'm going to go back over

[09:28:39 - 09:28:45]
to wherever that spaces

[09:28:42 - 09:28:46]
was maybe close out some of these tabs

[09:28:45 - 09:28:49]
so things are a little bit less

[09:28:46 - 09:28:51]
confusing here it is okay so I have the

[09:28:49 - 09:28:54]
cup I'm just going to try and see what

[09:28:51 - 09:28:54]
happens

[09:28:57 - 09:29:04]
okay so we have our cup

[09:28:59 - 09:29:05]
good now what upload an image and click

[09:29:04 - 09:29:09]
generate

[09:29:05 - 09:29:09]
generate did I click

[09:29:09 - 09:29:14]
it okay I did I did click it okay great

[09:29:11 - 09:29:16]
so it's spinning and it's processing it

[09:29:14 - 09:29:18]
here it's suggesting it could take 22

[09:29:16 - 09:29:22]
seconds we don't really know for certain

[09:29:18 - 09:29:24]
whoa that is awesome

[09:29:22 - 09:29:26]
that is really cool okay so now the next

[09:29:24 - 09:29:28]
question is could I download this asset

[09:29:26 - 09:29:31]
so if you find the generated 3D asset uh

[09:29:28 - 09:29:33]
satisfactory extract the glb file so

[09:29:31 - 09:29:35]
we'll go ahead and extract that out and

[09:29:33 - 09:29:36]
I think I've been seeing these online

[09:29:35 - 09:29:37]
some of these things here so that's

[09:29:36 - 09:29:40]
pretty

[09:29:37 - 09:29:42]
cool and so now it's running another

[09:29:40 - 09:29:45]
thing to extract it

[09:29:42 - 09:29:47]
out and so I'm just waiting for it I

[09:29:45 - 09:29:50]
feel like I can make a video game so

[09:29:47 - 09:29:52]
quickly these days because of this it's

[09:29:50 - 09:29:55]
amazing not a good video game but I

[09:29:52 - 09:29:56]
could make a video game and so down

[09:29:55 - 09:29:58]
below here it's just processing it so

[09:29:56 - 09:30:00]
we're just waiting for that extraction

[09:29:58 - 09:30:03]
so we'll give it a moment okay all right

[09:30:00 - 09:30:05]
so let's go download the glb file and I

[09:30:03 - 09:30:08]
actually don't know what a glb

[09:30:05 - 09:30:11]
is I wonder if I could open that in

[09:30:08 - 09:30:11]
blender uh let's see

[09:30:13 - 09:30:17]
blender okay what if I was to open

[09:30:16 - 09:30:22]
blender do I have blender install on

[09:30:17 - 09:30:24]
this computer I do not um what could

[09:30:22 - 09:30:24]
could render

[09:30:26 - 09:30:31]
glbs for those who don't know I used to

[09:30:28 - 09:30:33]
do 3D modeling like long time ago but

[09:30:31 - 09:30:36]
it's been a while so supported by

[09:30:33 - 09:30:40]
various it says blender can do it

[09:30:36 - 09:30:43]
um but I guess I just don't

[09:30:40 - 09:30:45]
have blend here so like glb

[09:30:43 - 09:30:47]
preview I mean it's previewing in the

[09:30:45 - 09:30:48]
browser so I don't really feel like I

[09:30:47 - 09:30:50]
need to do much with it but it would

[09:30:48 - 09:30:52]
have been interesting to just like open

[09:30:50 - 09:30:54]
it up in blender or something that I

[09:30:52 - 09:30:57]
know and just see like how clean the

[09:30:54 - 09:31:00]
lines are um for those who don't know

[09:30:57 - 09:31:03]
like models are made up of ver ver

[09:31:00 - 09:31:05]
vertices and edges and based on the

[09:31:03 - 09:31:07]
shapes of them some are better than

[09:31:05 - 09:31:08]
others so uh you know that might be

[09:31:07 - 09:31:11]
something to look into but I'm dragging

[09:31:08 - 09:31:13]
the file in here to here I mean it loads

[09:31:11 - 09:31:16]
and it's textured too which is nice I

[09:31:13 - 09:31:19]
wonder if we could go and see it's

[09:31:16 - 09:31:22]
skeleton or wireframe there we go oh no

[09:31:19 - 09:31:26]
no no no no no no no no no I mean it's

[09:31:22 - 09:31:27]
good but whoa that's a little bit too

[09:31:26 - 09:31:30]
much

[09:31:27 - 09:31:33]
um I can take anything off

[09:31:30 - 09:31:36]
here

[09:31:33 - 09:31:39]
none oh my

[09:31:36 - 09:31:44]
goodness

[09:31:39 - 09:31:47]
uh I'm just trying to see like really is

[09:31:44 - 09:31:49]
that it's really that that many uh that

[09:31:47 - 09:31:52]
many vertices I mean it looks good but

[09:31:49 - 09:31:56]
the question is like how many you know

[09:31:52 - 09:31:56]
how many polygons glb polygon

[09:32:02 - 09:32:05]
count and so that wouldn't be easy for

[09:32:04 - 09:32:08]
me to check right now again I'd have to

[09:32:05 - 09:32:11]
bring that into something like blender

[09:32:08 - 09:32:13]
does it look good yeah it looks good but

[09:32:11 - 09:32:15]
um would I use that in a game I don't

[09:32:13 - 09:32:18]
know it depends on uh I mean it's

[09:32:15 - 09:32:20]
rendering fine I guess in my browser so

[09:32:18 - 09:32:22]
I guess it's fine but like notice here

[09:32:20 - 09:32:24]
looks like the polygons are lot smaller

[09:32:22 - 09:32:26]
so I don't know the only way I would

[09:32:24 - 09:32:29]
really know is that I have to bring that

[09:32:26 - 09:32:31]
into um I'd have to bring that into a

[09:32:29 - 09:32:33]
blender and I don't feel like installing

[09:32:31 - 09:32:34]
that here today um let's go take a look

[09:32:33 - 09:32:37]
at another one here I'm just curious

[09:32:34 - 09:32:37]
let's go generate this one

[09:32:41 - 09:32:47]
out this is why we need more expensive

[09:32:43 - 09:32:48]
CPUs because people can be uh um using

[09:32:47 - 09:32:50]
these kind of assets but there is a way

[09:32:48 - 09:32:53]
that I could bring it into blender and

[09:32:50 - 09:32:55]
then low poy it that's really good

[09:32:53 - 09:32:58]
that's really really

[09:32:55 - 09:32:59]
good let's go generate that out that

[09:32:58 - 09:33:03]
looks like

[09:32:59 - 09:33:03]
fun oh I already generated

[09:33:04 - 09:33:08]
it what I meant to do was I meant to

[09:33:06 - 09:33:10]
click the extract

[09:33:08 - 09:33:12]
glb but like it didn't take that long

[09:33:10 - 09:33:14]
there we go so let's click this now it

[09:33:12 - 09:33:16]
says 42 seconds so we'll just wait a

[09:33:14 - 09:33:17]
moment till that's done all right so

[09:33:16 - 09:33:18]
this is now generated out let's take a

[09:33:17 - 09:33:22]
look

[09:33:18 - 09:33:26]
here and uh I mean I can see the polygon

[09:33:22 - 09:33:28]
so maybe the polygon count is not as

[09:33:26 - 09:33:30]
high but yeah I just don't have

[09:33:28 - 09:33:31]
confidence with that that preview app

[09:33:30 - 09:33:33]
that I was using but uh it looks good

[09:33:31 - 09:33:36]
and I mean it's running my browser no

[09:33:33 - 09:33:37]
problem so yeah that's that's great um

[09:33:36 - 09:33:40]
I'm not sure how textures things it

[09:33:37 - 09:33:40]
doesn't know

[09:33:40 - 09:33:44]
about I don't know it seems to do a

[09:33:42 - 09:33:46]
really good job so that's pretty cool

[09:33:44 - 09:33:48]
let's go back

[09:33:46 - 09:33:54]
here is there any other spaces we could

[09:33:48 - 09:33:56]
check out uh flux Phil outp flux wow uh

[09:33:54 - 09:33:58]
Sora 3D well that's another 3D one we

[09:33:56 - 09:34:00]
don't need to do that

[09:33:58 - 09:34:03]
twice but

[09:34:00 - 09:34:05]
uh let's try Flex out

[09:34:03 - 09:34:08]
painting

[09:34:05 - 09:34:10]
and I guess I need an image so let's go

[09:34:08 - 09:34:12]
ahead and I've been watching

[09:34:10 - 09:34:14]
Dandan I hope I don't get anything

[09:34:12 - 09:34:17]
that's inappropriate

[09:34:14 - 09:34:17]
here

[09:34:18 - 09:34:24]
um so yeah maybe we take this one here D

[09:34:21 - 09:34:26]
is pretty popular right now and I need

[09:34:24 - 09:34:29]
to crop it somehow so I'm going to just

[09:34:26 - 09:34:32]
bring it into paint really

[09:34:29 - 09:34:33]
quickly if I just find paint here open

[09:34:32 - 09:34:37]
with paint open with paint with paint

[09:34:33 - 09:34:40]
with paint where are you paint paint

[09:34:37 - 09:34:42]
there we go everyone's favorite app and

[09:34:40 - 09:34:44]
we drag that into here and what I'm

[09:34:42 - 09:34:45]
going to do is oops that's not what I

[09:34:44 - 09:34:49]
meant to

[09:34:45 - 09:34:50]
do um let's said out painting right so

[09:34:49 - 09:34:52]
let me just double check I think that

[09:34:50 - 09:34:55]
means like extend the scene if I'm if

[09:34:52 - 09:34:57]
I'm correct so we go back over to here

[09:34:55 - 09:35:00]
you like to extend and pick your R

[09:34:57 - 09:35:00]
expected ratio okay great

[09:35:02 - 09:35:10]
so I like image ratio that I'm providing

[09:35:06 - 09:35:10]
and resize input

[09:35:13 - 09:35:20]
ratio does the input one have to be

[09:35:16 - 09:35:22]
that okay well I'm going to

[09:35:20 - 09:35:25]
just can I uh restrict on the Square

[09:35:22 - 09:35:25]
size I'm not sure how I

[09:35:26 - 09:35:32]
could trying to make like a perfect

[09:35:28 - 09:35:34]
square here one second so this is n 190

[09:35:32 - 09:35:36]
by 1080 and so I'm going to go here I'm

[09:35:34 - 09:35:38]
just going to make a new

[09:35:36 - 09:35:42]
one no that's not what I

[09:35:38 - 09:35:44]
want I'm just going to drag this up let

[09:35:42 - 09:35:47]
see if I can bring the

[09:35:44 - 09:35:49]
smaller so what I'm trying to do can I

[09:35:47 - 09:35:53]
can I just double click this

[09:35:49 - 09:35:53]
no VI

[09:35:54 - 09:35:59]
and so I want to get this to be exactly

[09:35:56 - 09:36:01]
860 there we go okay great and so now we

[09:35:59 - 09:36:04]
have uh this image here I'm going to go

[09:36:01 - 09:36:06]
save it okay so that's somewhere

[09:36:04 - 09:36:08]
probably on my desktop and let's go

[09:36:06 - 09:36:12]
ahead and drag it in

[09:36:08 - 09:36:14]
here okay and I'm not going to provide

[09:36:12 - 09:36:19]
it any information the ratio is 1 to

[09:36:14 - 09:36:23]
one and we will go ahead and say

[09:36:19 - 09:36:26]
75% and this one is

[09:36:23 - 09:36:26]
what is this image size I

[09:36:28 - 09:36:34]
forgot it's uh 860 by

[09:36:31 - 09:36:36]
860 so that's fine yeah we'll go ahead

[09:36:34 - 09:36:38]
and just try that so they

[09:36:36 - 09:36:40]
generate I haven't provided it any

[09:36:38 - 09:36:42]
instructions it probably needs some

[09:36:40 - 09:36:43]
information if it wants to do a good job

[09:36:42 - 09:36:45]
but I just want to see if it extends and

[09:36:43 - 09:36:49]
again we're just trying out spaces for

[09:36:45 - 09:36:54]
fun here unbelievably awesome this uh

[09:36:49 - 09:36:54]
zero uh zero GPT or zero um

[09:37:00 - 09:37:07]
gpus okay so I'm going to pause

[09:37:04 - 09:37:12]
here there we go

[09:37:07 - 09:37:15]
and I mean it did extend the

[09:37:12 - 09:37:16]
image uh so just say scho uh anime

[09:37:15 - 09:37:21]
school

[09:37:16 - 09:37:24]
boy walking around uh outside their

[09:37:21 - 09:37:26]
school maybe that would help because

[09:37:24 - 09:37:29]
this is uh I mean it did generate stuff

[09:37:26 - 09:37:31]
we cannot say that it didn't do that but

[09:37:29 - 09:37:32]
um we did not provide it any information

[09:37:31 - 09:37:34]
so maybe this one we might do a little

[09:37:32 - 09:37:37]
bit better but again not spending any

[09:37:34 - 09:37:39]
money just clicking on things here here

[09:37:37 - 09:37:41]
we go and uh it's interesting we're

[09:37:39 - 09:37:43]
getting Japanese text so it knows that

[09:37:41 - 09:37:45]
it's anime uh is it making any sense

[09:37:43 - 09:37:47]
what it's saying down

[09:37:45 - 09:37:50]
there I don't know but you know what it

[09:37:47 - 09:37:53]
might be fun let's see what Tex had

[09:37:50 - 09:37:55]
actually produced so grab this um I can

[09:37:53 - 09:37:56]
go over to something like Chachi BT we

[09:37:55 - 09:38:00]
might be able to do in Gemini here let's

[09:37:56 - 09:38:03]
just try here Gemini uh can you uh

[09:38:00 - 09:38:05]
translate the Japanese

[09:38:03 - 09:38:07]
text to

[09:38:05 - 09:38:09]
English I'm not sure if it will do it

[09:38:07 - 09:38:11]
here but we'll

[09:38:09 - 09:38:15]
see maybe flash won't do

[09:38:11 - 09:38:18]
it so it says here I mean I'm not sure

[09:38:15 - 09:38:21]
if that really is what that image

[09:38:18 - 09:38:22]
said but uh oh did it grab it from an ex

[09:38:21 - 09:38:25]
existing source that is similar that's

[09:38:22 - 09:38:25]
really interesting but we have

[09:38:26 - 09:38:32]
here sometimes he sings in a high pitch

[09:38:28 - 09:38:32]
voice this translate he can sing a high

[09:38:32 - 09:38:37]
note yeah okay so I think what it did

[09:38:35 - 09:38:39]
maybe what the model did is it had

[09:38:37 - 09:38:41]
Source images in Japanese with subtitles

[09:38:39 - 09:38:43]
and it literally pulled them in because

[09:38:41 - 09:38:44]
I said anime right but uh it's really

[09:38:43 - 09:38:47]
interesting that it did that but it did

[09:38:44 - 09:38:48]
extend the scene so it kind of worked

[09:38:47 - 09:38:51]
and then we have some uh obviously

[09:38:48 - 09:38:53]
unusual stuff but again totally free I

[09:38:51 - 09:38:57]
can't expect to have amazing results

[09:38:53 - 09:39:00]
here but yeah that that's spaces I guess

[09:38:57 - 09:39:02]
and we can create our own space but I

[09:39:00 - 09:39:04]
mean I don't really have any use cases

[09:39:02 - 09:39:06]
for creating my own space so I guess I

[09:39:04 - 09:39:08]
don't care but clearly we would just

[09:39:06 - 09:39:10]
upload

[09:39:08 - 09:39:12]
um upload either gradio or Streamlight

[09:39:10 - 09:39:14]
code and I I just don't care about doing

[09:39:12 - 09:39:16]
that right now so I think we'll just

[09:39:14 - 09:39:18]
call this uh an exploration of spaces

[09:39:16 - 09:39:22]
and we'll continue on if we can find

[09:39:18 - 09:39:22]
anything else with hugging face okay

[09:39:23 - 09:39:25]
[Music]

[09:39:24 - 09:39:28]
all right so we are still in hugging

[09:39:25 - 09:39:30]
faces and um one thing we didn't do is

[09:39:28 - 09:39:31]
work with any data sets I don't work

[09:39:30 - 09:39:33]
with these very often but sometimes you

[09:39:31 - 09:39:35]
need them when you are trying to do

[09:39:33 - 09:39:38]
training I recognize SM talk uh as a

[09:39:35 - 09:39:40]
data set that I've seen before um I

[09:39:38 - 09:39:42]
don't know what the data set is let's go

[09:39:40 - 09:39:43]
take a look here it says this is a

[09:39:42 - 09:39:46]
synthetic data set designed for

[09:39:43 - 09:39:50]
supervised fine-tuning of LMS it was

[09:39:46 - 09:39:51]
used for small M2 instruct okay so yeah

[09:39:50 - 09:39:54]
data sets are there something that you

[09:39:51 - 09:39:55]
can load in okay and then you would use

[09:39:54 - 09:39:58]
for

[09:39:55 - 09:40:00]
training um I don't know I mean there's

[09:39:58 - 09:40:02]
probably like a really easy data set

[09:40:00 - 09:40:04]
that we can use let's go over back to

[09:40:02 - 09:40:07]
Gemini where are you Gemini do I still

[09:40:04 - 09:40:08]
have you kicking around

[09:40:07 - 09:40:10]
here uh we'll say

[09:40:08 - 09:40:14]
[Music]

[09:40:10 - 09:40:16]
Gemini it's crazy that um google'll

[09:40:14 - 09:40:17]
tried charging for this initially and

[09:40:16 - 09:40:20]
obviously they have the flash model now

[09:40:17 - 09:40:21]
so they went back on that but um I want

[09:40:20 - 09:40:25]
to

[09:40:21 - 09:40:29]
uh use a very simple data set in some

[09:40:25 - 09:40:31]
kind of uh example for hugging face and

[09:40:29 - 09:40:35]
so this is something that we

[09:40:31 - 09:40:40]
should give a give a

[09:40:35 - 09:40:40]
go okay and so

[09:40:42 - 09:40:50]
here I mean this is a small data set

[09:40:46 - 09:40:51]
okay but I I want to use an existing

[09:40:50 - 09:40:54]
data set

[09:40:51 - 09:40:57]
not upload one but at least it's telling

[09:40:54 - 09:41:00]
us that we could do it which is

[09:40:57 - 09:41:00]
[Music]

[09:41:02 - 09:41:07]
fine okay but it doesn't seem to know of

[09:41:04 - 09:41:07]
a basic

[09:41:11 - 09:41:16]
one here we

[09:41:14 - 09:41:18]
have you might need to preprocess the

[09:41:16 - 09:41:19]
data set before a specific task so this

[09:41:18 - 09:41:22]
could involve tokenization feature

[09:41:19 - 09:41:25]
section stuff like that

[09:41:22 - 09:41:27]
um you can use this fine tune Bert for

[09:41:25 - 09:41:29]
questioning and

[09:41:27 - 09:41:30]
answering so this might be something

[09:41:29 - 09:41:32]
that we could

[09:41:30 - 09:41:34]
do I don't really like what it's giving

[09:41:32 - 09:41:36]
us for examples I'm going to go over to

[09:41:34 - 09:41:36]
Claud

[09:41:37 - 09:41:45]
AI great so I'm going to say I need I

[09:41:41 - 09:41:49]
want to train or I want to use

[09:41:45 - 09:41:52]
a small data set to train uh pre-train

[09:41:49 - 09:41:55]
Bert

[09:41:52 - 09:42:00]
to do uh

[09:41:55 - 09:42:01]
Q&A using hugging face data sets can you

[09:42:00 - 09:42:04]
give

[09:42:01 - 09:42:05]
me a small code example can you give me

[09:42:04 - 09:42:08]
a code

[09:42:05 - 09:42:10]
example that will run on a small amount

[09:42:08 - 09:42:13]
of

[09:42:10 - 09:42:14]
CPUs that's not the best worded but I

[09:42:13 - 09:42:16]
have a feeling that Claude might perform

[09:42:14 - 09:42:17]
this a little bit better not to say that

[09:42:16 - 09:42:19]
Google Gemini is bad it was fine but

[09:42:17 - 09:42:21]
it's just like I need something more

[09:42:19 - 09:42:23]
concrete and

[09:42:21 - 09:42:25]
now we're seeing this squad thing again

[09:42:23 - 09:42:27]
so maybe that is a data set and this

[09:42:25 - 09:42:29]
one's giving us version

[09:42:27 - 09:42:32]
two so go over to here I'm not familiar

[09:42:29 - 09:42:35]
with Squad but so it says Stanford

[09:42:32 - 09:42:37]
question answering data set okay well

[09:42:35 - 09:42:38]
that makes sense and so here we have uh

[09:42:37 - 09:42:41]
title

[09:42:38 - 09:42:43]
Beyonce when did Beyonce become a star

[09:42:41 - 09:42:47]
and then here's the output so we're

[09:42:43 - 09:42:50]
getting example data so that's pretty

[09:42:47 - 09:42:53]
clear okay so let's go give that a

[09:42:50 - 09:42:56]
go so what I'm going to do is I'm going

[09:42:53 - 09:42:58]
to bring back our environment

[09:42:56 - 09:43:00]
here um this was was the one I was

[09:42:58 - 09:43:02]
running just a moment ago in lightning

[09:43:00 - 09:43:04]
AI again we can use whatever we want I'm

[09:43:02 - 09:43:07]
just using lightning AI here

[09:43:04 - 09:43:09]
today but because we're going to do some

[09:43:07 - 09:43:12]
super fine tuning in a very in the mo in

[09:43:09 - 09:43:14]
a very basic model with Bert um I

[09:43:12 - 09:43:17]
figured that uh you know this this will

[09:43:14 - 09:43:19]
be fine just using CPUs I could probably

[09:43:17 - 09:43:22]
do this on my my computer or on my Mac

[09:43:19 - 09:43:25]
but I'm going to go ahead and

[09:43:22 - 09:43:28]
and give this a go here using claud's

[09:43:25 - 09:43:30]
Code sorry Gemini I mean Gemini looks

[09:43:28 - 09:43:33]
okay I just uh I'm not sure about

[09:43:30 - 09:43:36]
it

[09:43:33 - 09:43:37]
so here it doesn't say like how much we

[09:43:36 - 09:43:40]
would

[09:43:37 - 09:43:42]
need so I'm going to go here so like how

[09:43:40 - 09:43:46]
much uh CPU and

[09:43:42 - 09:43:46]
memory would we

[09:43:47 - 09:43:51]
need I really don't know so this is

[09:43:49 - 09:43:52]
where like if I ask my friend roll plus

[09:43:51 - 09:43:55]
she'd know like right off the top of her

[09:43:52 - 09:43:59]
head so it says minimum uh two CPUs 4 to

[09:43:55 - 09:44:03]
8 8 to 16 training Time 1 to two hours

[09:43:59 - 09:44:07]
on four four four small I okay I need to

[09:44:03 - 09:44:10]
I need to train something in 15 minutes

[09:44:07 - 09:44:12]
okay what what do I need to do what what

[09:44:10 - 09:44:12]
can I do for

[09:44:16 - 09:44:21]
this okay for a 50-minute training

[09:44:19 - 09:44:23]
window okay that sounds great now it's

[09:44:21 - 09:44:25]
suggesting

[09:44:23 - 09:44:27]
Squad um and that's just a d a different

[09:44:25 - 09:44:30]
data set I suppose so I'm not sure if it

[09:44:27 - 09:44:31]
really matters if it's squad or Squad uh

[09:44:30 - 09:44:34]
Squad version 2 let's take a look at

[09:44:31 - 09:44:38]
this one and so the data is a little bit

[09:44:34 - 09:44:40]
different this is 87 rows this one's

[09:44:38 - 09:44:41]
130,000 rows so this data set's a little

[09:44:40 - 09:44:46]
bit

[09:44:41 - 09:44:49]
smaller um and we'll go back over to

[09:44:46 - 09:44:52]
here and so this one here is for 15

[09:44:49 - 09:44:53]
minute one use fast distilled uh BT so

[09:44:52 - 09:44:57]
you're going to see this term a lot

[09:44:53 - 09:44:58]
distill so what is distill because it

[09:44:57 - 09:45:00]
just means like they've done something

[09:44:58 - 09:45:02]
to the model to make it to smaller

[09:45:00 - 09:45:02]
distill

[09:45:02 - 09:45:06]
models the process of transferring

[09:45:04 - 09:45:08]
Knowledge from a larger model to a

[09:45:06 - 09:45:10]
smaller one okay so it's yeah distilling

[09:45:08 - 09:45:13]
that makes sense and this one says fast

[09:45:10 - 09:45:16]
so yeah using distill is is 40% smaller

[09:45:13 - 09:45:18]
60% faster reduce data set to 100

[09:45:16 - 09:45:21]
training examples and and things like

[09:45:18 - 09:45:23]
that so yeah this one's greatly reduced

[09:45:21 - 09:45:27]
used okay so what I want to do is go

[09:45:23 - 09:45:29]
back over to here and it's

[09:45:27 - 09:45:31]
suggesting it can train within 10 to 15

[09:45:29 - 09:45:32]
minutes okay that sounds a lot more

[09:45:31 - 09:45:37]
reasonable so I'm going to go ahead here

[09:45:32 - 09:45:37]
and say new new say HF data

[09:45:38 - 09:45:44]
sets and again not a super expert at

[09:45:41 - 09:45:47]
this stuff but you can see we're getting

[09:45:44 - 09:45:49]
by uh pretty well um and right now we're

[09:45:47 - 09:45:51]
in VSCO we could go to Jupiter lab if if

[09:45:49 - 09:45:53]
that's what people prefer here

[09:45:51 - 09:45:55]
[Music]

[09:45:53 - 09:45:57]
um I think I'm going to do I'm going to

[09:45:55 - 09:46:00]
switch over to

[09:45:57 - 09:46:02]
juper I'm indecisive I switch between uh

[09:46:00 - 09:46:05]
both of them all the time but I think

[09:46:02 - 09:46:05]
I'd rather do this in Jupiter here

[09:46:06 - 09:46:10]
today and so um you know again if my

[09:46:09 - 09:46:12]
friend Rola was here uh when she talks

[09:46:10 - 09:46:14]
about models she might say like hey you

[09:46:12 - 09:46:15]
don't always need llm you can use a

[09:46:14 - 09:46:17]
smaller model like Bert and that's what

[09:46:15 - 09:46:20]
we're doing right

[09:46:17 - 09:46:21]
now uh but we'll say hugging face um

[09:46:20 - 09:46:23]
data set

[09:46:21 - 09:46:26]
uh hugging face data set here I'm going

[09:46:23 - 09:46:28]
to go back over to here and I'm going to

[09:46:26 - 09:46:30]
bring in some of our code uh we're going

[09:46:28 - 09:46:32]
to have to do a pip install on this so

[09:46:30 - 09:46:34]
we're going to have to bring in PIP

[09:46:32 - 09:46:36]
install trans uh we'll do Hy and Q to

[09:46:34 - 09:46:37]
silence it we'll bring in Transformers

[09:46:36 - 09:46:41]
and data

[09:46:37 - 09:46:44]
sets okay we'll go ahead and install

[09:46:41 - 09:46:47]
those um we will need some of our other

[09:46:44 - 09:46:52]
code from before so I'm going to also

[09:46:47 - 09:46:56]
bring in um py uh python. EMV

[09:46:52 - 09:46:59]
okay we'll run that and I also need this

[09:46:56 - 09:47:01]
code here so I'll bring that in as well

[09:46:59 - 09:47:04]
which I'll bring above

[09:47:01 - 09:47:07]
here sometimes you have to restart not

[09:47:04 - 09:47:08]
always but here we are going to bring in

[09:47:07 - 09:47:11]
um data sets and then a bunch of stuff

[09:47:08 - 09:47:13]
for um the

[09:47:11 - 09:47:15]
Transformers and so I mean the rest of

[09:47:13 - 09:47:17]
the code looks

[09:47:15 - 09:47:19]
okay not that I'm an expert but we will

[09:47:17 - 09:47:21]
work through it here and see how far we

[09:47:19 - 09:47:23]
get so I'm just going to bring this down

[09:47:21 - 09:47:25]
I'm going to just make a few of these

[09:47:23 - 09:47:27]
we'll bring that here and then we'll

[09:47:25 - 09:47:30]
just start dragging this up I know it

[09:47:27 - 09:47:32]
looks really complex but sometimes by

[09:47:30 - 09:47:34]
the way you know if you're like Andrew

[09:47:32 - 09:47:35]
I'm not getting the same code again you

[09:47:34 - 09:47:36]
could just grab this from the repo

[09:47:35 - 09:47:38]
because I'm going to drop it in there

[09:47:36 - 09:47:42]
after this um but I'm grabbing this

[09:47:38 - 09:47:42]
stuff up here this function is really

[09:47:43 - 09:47:48]
large

[09:47:46 - 09:47:49]
okay and then we'll read through and

[09:47:48 - 09:47:52]
we'll see if we can kind of make sense

[09:47:49 - 09:47:52]
of it

[09:47:54 - 09:48:00]
oops oops oops I'm not sure why I did

[09:47:57 - 09:48:02]
that grab it again my keyboard was kind

[09:48:00 - 09:48:04]
of messing up

[09:48:02 - 09:48:06]
there

[09:48:04 - 09:48:08]
and H I think the last one yeah we'll

[09:48:06 - 09:48:10]
bring it into a separate one who cares

[09:48:08 - 09:48:12]
okay so now that it's broken

[09:48:10 - 09:48:14]
up it's a little bit more controlled and

[09:48:12 - 09:48:17]
we can kind of see what's going on here

[09:48:14 - 09:48:21]
um so first thing is we

[09:48:17 - 09:48:22]
have yeah we we need to load our liaries

[09:48:21 - 09:48:24]
and we have load the data set so it's

[09:48:22 - 09:48:25]
bringing the data set in and we're

[09:48:24 - 09:48:28]
saying only provide the first 100

[09:48:25 - 09:48:30]
examples and then we need a evaluation

[09:48:28 - 09:48:33]
data set to make sure that things have

[09:48:30 - 09:48:34]
worked correctly so we'll do that load

[09:48:33 - 09:48:36]
the smaller model and tokenizer so we

[09:48:34 - 09:48:38]
have the model name from pre-trained

[09:48:36 - 09:48:39]
model so remember we loaded a direct

[09:48:38 - 09:48:41]
model before so that's exactly what

[09:48:39 - 09:48:46]
we're doing here could there be a

[09:48:41 - 09:48:46]
pipeline for this I don't know

[09:48:46 - 09:48:51]
maybe um so it say some weights were not

[09:48:48 - 09:48:53]
initialized for the models

[09:48:51 - 09:48:54]
you should probably train the model on a

[09:48:53 - 09:48:57]
downstream task to be able to use it for

[09:48:54 - 09:48:59]
prediction inference that's what we are

[09:48:57 - 09:49:01]
doing that's our goal simplify

[09:48:59 - 09:49:03]
pre-processing function

[09:49:01 - 09:49:06]
so pre-processing means it's going to do

[09:49:03 - 09:49:08]
something to our data and prepare it so

[09:49:06 - 09:49:09]
here we're providing the examples okay

[09:49:08 - 09:49:11]
we're getting the questions we're

[09:49:09 - 09:49:14]
getting the context we're tokenizing the

[09:49:11 - 09:49:16]
inputs because the model requires the

[09:49:14 - 09:49:19]
data to be

[09:49:16 - 09:49:20]
tokenized um what it doing here it has

[09:49:19 - 09:49:22]
the inputs and it's looking at the

[09:49:20 - 09:49:24]
offset mapping it's finding the token

[09:49:22 - 09:49:27]
indices and it's putting the start and

[09:49:24 - 09:49:29]
end tokens I know that we keep getting

[09:49:27 - 09:49:31]
errors about like start and end tokens

[09:49:29 - 09:49:33]
so maybe has something to do with that

[09:49:31 - 09:49:34]
like errors prior like that having start

[09:49:33 - 09:49:36]
and end tokens are important in your

[09:49:34 - 09:49:39]
tokenization process so this looks like

[09:49:36 - 09:49:42]
it's just taking the data and getting it

[09:49:39 - 09:49:44]
ready for input that's what it's doing

[09:49:42 - 09:49:45]
okay so now we have process of the data

[09:49:44 - 09:49:47]
set so we have the data set we're going

[09:49:45 - 09:49:49]
to map so iterate over it we're

[09:49:47 - 09:49:51]
providing the pre-process function that

[09:49:49 - 09:49:53]
we defined here and so it's going to

[09:49:51 - 09:49:55]
format the data um and that's what it's

[09:49:53 - 09:49:59]
going to do okay it's putting into batch

[09:49:55 - 09:50:02]
size two here we'll go down below batch

[09:49:59 - 09:50:04]
length 71 does not match text pair 697

[09:50:02 - 09:50:06]
so I'm not sure what to do about that

[09:50:04 - 09:50:08]
we'll go ask um Claude because I don't

[09:50:06 - 09:50:10]
know enough about the configuration to

[09:50:08 - 09:50:12]
make make a fix for

[09:50:10 - 09:50:14]
that it might be its pre-processing

[09:50:12 - 09:50:16]
pre-processing

[09:50:14 - 09:50:18]
function isn't handling the batch inputs

[09:50:16 - 09:50:21]
correctly okay I'd rather it just give

[09:50:18 - 09:50:24]
us that but it didn't do that

[09:50:21 - 09:50:24]
and so we'll go

[09:50:25 - 09:50:28]
here

[09:50:28 - 09:50:34]
and I think we just have to grab the

[09:50:30 - 09:50:36]
prepr function here pre-processing

[09:50:34 - 09:50:39]
function but this one looks a bit

[09:50:36 - 09:50:39]
different here it says batch

[09:50:39 - 09:50:45]
32 okay so I'm going to go up

[09:50:42 - 09:50:46]
here and I can't tell what's changed I

[09:50:45 - 09:50:46]
would have rather just had the things

[09:50:46 - 09:50:49]
that

[09:50:46 - 09:50:51]
changed and then we'll go to here and

[09:50:49 - 09:50:53]
I'm just going to change this to this

[09:50:51 - 09:50:55]
like

[09:50:53 - 09:50:57]
this okay I'm going to hope that that's

[09:50:55 - 09:51:00]
all that's changed again just kind of

[09:50:57 - 09:51:02]
guessing based on what I'm

[09:51:00 - 09:51:04]
reading this is our old no that's our

[09:51:02 - 09:51:06]
evaluation data set I'm going to see if

[09:51:04 - 09:51:07]
that one's changed at all this one has

[09:51:06 - 09:51:09]
changed as well so I'm going to go ahead

[09:51:07 - 09:51:11]
and change

[09:51:09 - 09:51:14]
that I'm also going to just scroll up

[09:51:11 - 09:51:17]
here see if any of this data has changed

[09:51:14 - 09:51:21]
above uh nope these are still the same I

[09:51:17 - 09:51:22]
believe so those are fine m I don't know

[09:51:21 - 09:51:25]
the training arguments have changed I

[09:51:22 - 09:51:26]
don't know if we've gotten there yet

[09:51:25 - 09:51:29]
since I don't know I'm just going to

[09:51:26 - 09:51:30]
grab the latest one here let's see here

[09:51:29 - 09:51:32]
yeah nothing's changed I'm going to

[09:51:30 - 09:51:34]
leave the one with the comments in I

[09:51:32 - 09:51:37]
prefer that and so it's prepared our

[09:51:34 - 09:51:40]
data set we'll do this

[09:51:37 - 09:51:42]
one and now we're ready to train so

[09:51:40 - 09:51:44]
let's go ahead and train our

[09:51:42 - 09:51:46]
arguments what's our problem using the

[09:51:44 - 09:51:49]
trainer pie torch uh requires

[09:51:46 - 09:51:50]
accelerator Etc please install

[09:51:49 - 09:51:53]
Transformers

[09:51:50 - 09:51:57]
torch okay and so it's asking

[09:51:53 - 09:51:58]
for that very specific version I'm going

[09:51:57 - 09:52:01]
to just bring this

[09:51:58 - 09:52:03]
down I'll just put it

[09:52:01 - 09:52:06]
here cancel we'll just save this file

[09:52:03 - 09:52:09]
and I'm going to go ahead and run it

[09:52:06 - 09:52:11]
again that's fine um we might have to

[09:52:09 - 09:52:13]
restart which is kind of annoying but

[09:52:11 - 09:52:13]
I'm going to try this

[09:52:14 - 09:52:19]
anyway

[09:52:16 - 09:52:21]
and it says please run Transformers or

[09:52:19 - 09:52:23]
pip install

[09:52:21 - 09:52:24]
accelerate so maybe what I should do I

[09:52:23 - 09:52:27]
just don't trust this I'm going to bring

[09:52:24 - 09:52:29]
this down to line cuz we do have um well

[09:52:27 - 09:52:30]
it's not doesn't say torch here but

[09:52:29 - 09:52:32]
we'll go ahead and just do this on a new

[09:52:30 - 09:52:35]
line

[09:52:32 - 09:52:38]
here I'm going to run this

[09:52:35 - 09:52:39]
again no matches found for Transformers

[09:52:38 - 09:52:41]
torch you may need to restart the kernel

[09:52:39 - 09:52:44]
to update the packages I'm going to go

[09:52:41 - 09:52:44]
restart this

[09:52:44 - 09:52:49]
again

[09:52:46 - 09:52:50]
sorry and actually um I think we're

[09:52:49 - 09:52:52]
supposed to take this one out and have

[09:52:50 - 09:52:53]
this one in here instead so I'm going to

[09:52:52 - 09:52:56]
take this one

[09:52:53 - 09:52:59]
out and yeah just saving this so we're

[09:52:56 - 09:53:01]
going to run this one this one's fine

[09:52:59 - 09:53:04]
I'm going to run that one no matches

[09:53:01 - 09:53:04]
found for this that's kind of

[09:53:10 - 09:53:16]
annoying I I have used torches pipe uh

[09:53:13 - 09:53:18]
uh torches um Transformers like that

[09:53:16 - 09:53:20]
before we going to go ahead and put that

[09:53:18 - 09:53:23]
in there I didn't want to get the code

[09:53:20 - 09:53:26]
sample there but we'll see what it

[09:53:23 - 09:53:29]
says so you need to install a torch okay

[09:53:26 - 09:53:30]
so that's what it wants fair enough I

[09:53:29 - 09:53:31]
didn't think I would have to do that

[09:53:30 - 09:53:33]
here but that's totally fine so we'll go

[09:53:31 - 09:53:35]
ahead and try this like it's probably

[09:53:33 - 09:53:38]
already

[09:53:35 - 09:53:38]
pre-installed

[09:53:41 - 09:53:45]
nope we'll try this one here

[09:53:54 - 09:54:00]
restart no matches

[09:53:58 - 09:54:03]
found this one's annoying so I'll run

[09:54:00 - 09:54:04]
this again and then this one again it's

[09:54:03 - 09:54:05]
kind of annoying because I'll have to

[09:54:04 - 09:54:06]
rep prepare my data here not that it

[09:54:05 - 09:54:09]
took very

[09:54:06 - 09:54:12]
long but they'll do this one and then

[09:54:09 - 09:54:12]
this

[09:54:17 - 09:54:22]
one I'm going to go to the top and just

[09:54:19 - 09:54:22]
run all

[09:54:27 - 09:54:33]
this stuff is tricky right like um I

[09:54:30 - 09:54:35]
like I know this this exists as a

[09:54:33 - 09:54:37]
package but yeah now we're getting a

[09:54:35 - 09:54:39]
little bit better results here so now

[09:54:37 - 09:54:42]
we're here down below is it going to say

[09:54:39 - 09:54:44]
the same thing using the trainer okay so

[09:54:42 - 09:54:48]
Transformers P torch does not exist it's

[09:54:44 - 09:54:48]
just saying it doesn't exist

[09:54:51 - 09:54:55]
okay like do I have to install something

[09:54:53 - 09:54:55]
else

[09:55:13 - 09:55:18]
maybe okay let's just look up the

[09:55:15 - 09:55:18]
library

[09:55:19 - 09:55:22]
then Transformers

[09:55:48 - 09:55:56]
torch okay um how do I install

[09:55:53 - 09:55:59]
Transformers porch when it says no

[09:55:56 - 09:55:59]
matches

[09:56:00 - 09:56:04]
found you're in your counting no match

[09:56:03 - 09:56:05]
found eror when installing torch it

[09:56:04 - 09:56:07]
often indicates compatibility between

[09:56:05 - 09:56:08]
Transformers library and Pie torch yeah

[09:56:07 - 09:56:11]
that's

[09:56:08 - 09:56:12]
fine um because then we'd have to create

[09:56:11 - 09:56:15]
our cond environment that's kind of a

[09:56:12 - 09:56:15]
pain

[09:56:20 - 09:56:25]
pip install Transformers

[09:56:23 - 09:56:28]
torch

[09:56:25 - 09:56:30]
um so this is where it's tricky because

[09:56:28 - 09:56:32]
like I don't

[09:56:30 - 09:56:35]
have I guess we could create a new cond

[09:56:32 - 09:56:37]
environment we could do that this is

[09:56:35 - 09:56:39]
kind of annoying so what I'll do I'm

[09:56:37 - 09:56:42]
going to go over to terminal

[09:56:39 - 09:56:45]
here I did this in one of our other boot

[09:56:42 - 09:56:46]
camps um or something we did it

[09:56:45 - 09:56:48]
somewhere I'm just going to go get the

[09:56:46 - 09:56:49]
code because I can never remember how to

[09:56:48 - 09:56:51]
do it off the top of my head but it's in

[09:56:49 - 09:56:53]
the

[09:56:51 - 09:56:57]
um gen training full day training day

[09:56:53 - 09:56:57]
not that one we'll go to exam Pro

[09:56:59 - 09:57:05]
here I'm going to go over to

[09:57:02 - 09:57:08]
repositories we'll just say

[09:57:05 - 09:57:10]
geni that's our gen Training Day

[09:57:08 - 09:57:13]
workshops and in here in our

[09:57:10 - 09:57:15]
intermediate one uh we were setting up a

[09:57:13 - 09:57:17]
Jupiter environment and so this is the

[09:57:15 - 09:57:19]
way you do it manually right so I'm

[09:57:17 - 09:57:22]
going to go over here and cond is

[09:57:19 - 09:57:24]
already AC AC I believe and so I need to

[09:57:22 - 09:57:26]
just create myself a new environment so

[09:57:24 - 09:57:27]
I'm going to bring in this one here it

[09:57:26 - 09:57:30]
says open V but we're going to switch

[09:57:27 - 09:57:31]
that out here just a moment so I'll

[09:57:30 - 09:57:33]
paste that in here and I'm just going to

[09:57:31 - 09:57:38]
switch this over

[09:57:33 - 09:57:40]
to um HF data sets

[09:57:38 - 09:57:42]
Okay condic create is not allowed a

[09:57:40 - 09:57:43]
studio has a default con environment uh

[09:57:42 - 09:57:45]
start a new studio to create a new

[09:57:43 - 09:57:47]
environment so that's what's telling us

[09:57:45 - 09:57:51]
to do so that kind of makes sense so I'm

[09:57:47 - 09:57:54]
going to go ahead and try cond uh

[09:57:51 - 09:57:58]
C cond

[09:57:54 - 09:58:01]
Forge and I'm going to say install

[09:57:58 - 09:58:05]
Transformers torch and see if that

[09:58:01 - 09:58:08]
works um it's not exactly what I want oh

[09:58:05 - 09:58:11]
hyphen seeond to forge okay so hyphen C

[09:58:08 - 09:58:11]
no I did that cond to

[09:58:12 - 09:58:18]
forge okay so I'm going to try

[09:58:16 - 09:58:20]
this ask it like why why does it think

[09:58:18 - 09:58:22]
this doesn't exist because if that's

[09:58:20 - 09:58:24]
what it's using for installation that

[09:58:22 - 09:58:24]
could be your

[09:58:24 - 09:58:30]
issue oh Force it's supposed to be kind

[09:58:27 - 09:58:30]
of Forge sorry one

[09:58:31 - 09:58:35]
second but that's still not that's still

[09:58:33 - 09:58:35]
not

[09:58:36 - 09:58:42]
working we go back over to here we'll

[09:58:38 - 09:58:42]
try this

[09:58:49 - 09:58:52]
[Music]

[09:58:51 - 09:58:54]
like cond Forge is where the file is

[09:58:52 - 09:58:56]
coming from right so let's say cond

[09:58:54 - 09:58:57]
Forge if we if we chose to install it

[09:58:56 - 09:59:01]
that way because underneath it's using

[09:58:57 - 09:59:04]
cond as a single environment and so here

[09:59:01 - 09:59:04]
we should be able to explore the

[09:59:04 - 09:59:09]
forge oh we can't okay like a lot of

[09:59:07 - 09:59:11]
package managers will let you search

[09:59:09 - 09:59:13]
maybe here like

[09:59:11 - 09:59:15]
Transformers but I thought maybe there'd

[09:59:13 - 09:59:18]
be like a list of packages like here

[09:59:15 - 09:59:21]
yeah here we go so let say

[09:59:18 - 09:59:22]
Transformers and so we have have

[09:59:21 - 09:59:24]
Transformers here but I don't have one

[09:59:22 - 09:59:26]
Transformers torch though I'm not really

[09:59:24 - 09:59:30]
sure what the square braces do I thought

[09:59:26 - 09:59:32]
maybe like that would be a separate

[09:59:30 - 09:59:37]
[Music]

[09:59:32 - 09:59:41]
package cond install

[09:59:37 - 09:59:41]
Transformers torch how do I do

[09:59:41 - 09:59:45]
that all right I'm going to spend a

[09:59:43 - 09:59:47]
little bit of time figuring out I'll be

[09:59:45 - 09:59:48]
back in just a moment okay I mean it

[09:59:47 - 09:59:52]
doesn't help very much but here like

[09:59:48 - 09:59:55]
they're showing it with a python

[09:59:52 - 09:59:55]
environment install from

[09:59:57 - 10:00:03]
[Music]

[10:00:00 - 10:00:07]
Source install wakonda here we

[10:00:03 - 10:00:09]
go install the from the cond channel

[10:00:07 - 10:00:11]
cond

[10:00:09 - 10:00:13]
Forge

[10:00:11 - 10:00:16]
okay

[10:00:13 - 10:00:18]
but all right uh that's fine I can I can

[10:00:16 - 10:00:19]
give this a go no matter what

[10:00:18 - 10:00:21]
environment we use we're going to have

[10:00:19 - 10:00:22]
different challenges so if I did this

[10:00:21 - 10:00:24]
locally or somewhere else it's always

[10:00:22 - 10:00:26]
just kind of a pain but I've installed

[10:00:24 - 10:00:28]
Transformers torch before with having no

[10:00:26 - 10:00:29]
issues we'll run this line and we'll see

[10:00:28 - 10:00:31]
what

[10:00:29 - 10:00:33]
happens um and it's doing something so

[10:00:31 - 10:00:37]
we'll give it a moment here

[10:00:33 - 10:00:38]
okay all right so it finished executing

[10:00:37 - 10:00:39]
that um I'm not sure if that's going to

[10:00:38 - 10:00:41]
help us let's go take a look here and

[10:00:39 - 10:00:44]
see what

[10:00:41 - 10:00:48]
happens um no matches found no matches

[10:00:44 - 10:00:50]
found uh okay so we'll do pip install

[10:00:48 - 10:00:52]
Transformers I don't know if we even

[10:00:50 - 10:00:56]
have Pip installed here but we'll try

[10:00:52 - 10:00:58]
this my goodness oh my goodness how am I

[10:00:56 - 10:00:58]
supposed to get this to

[10:00:58 - 10:01:05]
run okay um let me figure it out oh by

[10:01:03 - 10:01:07]
the way pre- chain models download to

[10:01:05 - 10:01:08]
here okay so I was saying earlier I

[10:01:07 - 10:01:10]
didn't know where they are it's telling

[10:01:08 - 10:01:11]
us right there that's where they go okay

[10:01:10 - 10:01:13]
so one thing it's suggesting it says for

[10:01:11 - 10:01:14]
CPU support only you can conveniently

[10:01:13 - 10:01:16]
install Transformers in a deep learning

[10:01:14 - 10:01:19]
library online for example sell

[10:01:16 - 10:01:21]
Transformers with P torch with this okay

[10:01:19 - 10:01:23]
so are they suggesting that if I don't

[10:01:21 - 10:01:26]
want to use CPUs well down below here it

[10:01:23 - 10:01:26]
says Transformers with tensor Floor

[10:01:26 - 10:01:31]
[Music]

[10:01:28 - 10:01:31]
2

[10:01:32 - 10:01:36]
okay but I can't specify any of these

[10:01:35 - 10:01:39]
things it's really annoying uh let's go

[10:01:36 - 10:01:39]
back over to

[10:01:43 - 10:01:48]
here okay so let's read this carefully

[10:01:46 - 10:01:51]
so future warning is deprecated and will

[10:01:48 - 10:01:54]
remove inversion

[10:01:51 - 10:01:56]
Etc no Cuda is deprecated here so four

[10:01:54 - 10:01:57]
CPUs that's what we're doing

[10:01:56 - 10:02:00]
here

[10:01:57 - 10:02:00]
[Music]

[10:02:01 - 10:02:05]
mhm where does it say no Cuda we don't

[10:02:03 - 10:02:07]
have any no Cuda here oh it's right here

[10:02:05 - 10:02:10]
okay so no Cuda so it says

[10:02:07 - 10:02:13]
um it will be removed in version five

[10:02:10 - 10:02:16]
use use CPU

[10:02:13 - 10:02:18]
instead okay so we'll do this use

[10:02:16 - 10:02:21]
CPU the

[10:02:18 - 10:02:24]
true let's try that instead that's not

[10:02:21 - 10:02:24]
our problem per

[10:02:26 - 10:02:31]
se the TR uh using the trainer with pi

[10:02:29 - 10:02:34]
torch requires

[10:02:31 - 10:02:34]
accelerate

[10:02:35 - 10:02:45]
0.602 okay so let's go back over here

[10:02:38 - 10:02:45]
I'm going to do uh pip list or PIP show

[10:02:45 - 10:02:50]
accelerate okay so pip install

[10:02:47 - 10:02:50]
accelerate

[10:02:51 - 10:02:56]
or maybe we'll just do cond install cond

[10:02:54 - 10:03:00]
install uh

[10:02:56 - 10:03:00]
accelerate can we do

[10:03:00 - 10:03:06]
that pip install

[10:03:03 - 10:03:09]
accelerate let's try that so that's

[10:03:06 - 10:03:11]
installing it's installing version

[10:03:09 - 10:03:14]
1.20 which is not exactly the version we

[10:03:11 - 10:03:16]
want but we can give it a go and see

[10:03:14 - 10:03:17]
what happens also I don't know if we

[10:03:16 - 10:03:21]
have to import it anywhere here we

[10:03:17 - 10:03:23]
didn't necessarily import it anywhere

[10:03:21 - 10:03:27]
um I give this a run here and see what

[10:03:23 - 10:03:29]
happens I'm going to restart the

[10:03:27 - 10:03:33]
kernel just one more

[10:03:29 - 10:03:33]
time and so we'll try this

[10:03:33 - 10:03:37]
again and this this is what it's like

[10:03:35 - 10:03:39]
you're just goofing around constantly

[10:03:37 - 10:03:43]
trying to get it to work says

[10:03:39 - 10:03:47]
module Pi Arrow lib has no tribute Pi 8

[10:03:43 - 10:03:48]
bu um and all I can think of is that

[10:03:47 - 10:03:51]
because we've installed the new Trans

[10:03:48 - 10:03:54]
the Transformer stuff stuff so we're

[10:03:51 - 10:03:56]
getting issues here I go back over to

[10:03:54 - 10:03:58]
here let's see if it can answer

[10:03:56 - 10:04:00]
it cuz like how would I know how would I

[10:03:58 - 10:04:02]
ever know how to do this the eror occurs

[10:04:00 - 10:04:04]
when an outdated version of pyro is

[10:04:02 - 10:04:04]
being

[10:04:06 - 10:04:10]
utilized okay we'll try

[10:04:13 - 10:04:16]
this for whatever reason this

[10:04:14 - 10:04:18]
environment doesn't work we can just

[10:04:16 - 10:04:22]
kill it and then bring up another one so

[10:04:18 - 10:04:24]
we'll restart the cel again restart

[10:04:22 - 10:04:29]
kernel and we'll try this again it could

[10:04:24 - 10:04:31]
be that I uh I installed um a much newer

[10:04:29 - 10:04:32]
version accelerate that might be causing

[10:04:31 - 10:04:35]
the issue I don't know that one's having

[10:04:32 - 10:04:36]
no problem now that one's having no

[10:04:35 - 10:04:39]
problem

[10:04:36 - 10:04:40]
now that one is not a problem because

[10:04:39 - 10:04:43]
we're going to train it we have our

[10:04:40 - 10:04:45]
pre-processed function right which is

[10:04:43 - 10:04:47]
fine we're going to hit play on the next

[10:04:45 - 10:04:50]
one play on the next one and now we're

[10:04:47 - 10:04:52]
on to training and we get a error so

[10:04:50 - 10:04:54]
that that's a bit better so it says

[10:04:52 - 10:04:56]
future warning evaluation strategy is

[10:04:54 - 10:04:59]
deer will be removed Transformers using

[10:04:56 - 10:05:03]
Val strategy instead

[10:04:59 - 10:05:06]
um evaluation strategy which is where

[10:05:03 - 10:05:11]
here it'll be removed Transformers use

[10:05:06 - 10:05:13]
eval strategy okay so this is now eval

[10:05:11 - 10:05:15]
strategy it made it look like that

[10:05:13 - 10:05:17]
worked so we're going to run this again

[10:05:15 - 10:05:19]
now we have no errors do you see how I

[10:05:17 - 10:05:21]
got this to have no errors question is

[10:05:19 - 10:05:23]
will it work that's a different

[10:05:21 - 10:05:25]
question we'll go ahead and hit this

[10:05:23 - 10:05:27]
this is going to actually do the

[10:05:25 - 10:05:29]
training how the heck did it train that

[10:05:27 - 10:05:32]
fast I have no idea we'll go ahead and

[10:05:29 - 10:05:33]
do this here it's dumping the model

[10:05:32 - 10:05:34]
right here so you know if we wanted to

[10:05:33 - 10:05:37]
put this somewhere else we could put it

[10:05:34 - 10:05:38]
and say like in our models so sorry the

[10:05:37 - 10:05:39]
training is really happening here we

[10:05:38 - 10:05:40]
could have brought this one up here and

[10:05:39 - 10:05:42]
put it with this line that probably

[10:05:40 - 10:05:43]
would have made more sense but it's

[10:05:42 - 10:05:45]
training it's going very quickly the

[10:05:43 - 10:05:50]
question is how do we use the model now

[10:05:45 - 10:05:52]
so like how do we how do we use

[10:05:50 - 10:05:56]
our trained

[10:05:52 - 10:05:56]
model because like I don't know

[10:05:57 - 10:06:01]
how like can we use a

[10:06:02 - 10:06:05]
pipeline so

[10:06:06 - 10:06:10]
[Music]

[10:06:12 - 10:06:17]
here and we're out of free messages

[10:06:15 - 10:06:19]
that's fine I can always wait till

[10:06:17 - 10:06:21]
tomorrow or like we have other ones we

[10:06:19 - 10:06:23]
can utilize here but this one seems okay

[10:06:21 - 10:06:25]
like we could probably get by with this

[10:06:23 - 10:06:27]
and so this is now completely trained so

[10:06:25 - 10:06:30]
now what I want to do is I want to load

[10:06:27 - 10:06:31]
this model okay so here this is where we

[10:06:30 - 10:06:35]
load the

[10:06:31 - 10:06:35]
model right so we'll go

[10:06:35 - 10:06:41]
[Music]

[10:06:38 - 10:06:43]
here and then returns those two things

[10:06:41 - 10:06:46]
right so I'll go ahead and run

[10:06:43 - 10:06:49]
that and then we actually have our Q&A

[10:06:46 - 10:06:50]
so bring this here

[10:06:49 - 10:06:52]
there's probably a way that we wouldn't

[10:06:50 - 10:06:55]
even have to use any functions we'll do

[10:06:52 - 10:06:56]
this let's take a look at this code so

[10:06:55 - 10:06:58]
it it takes in the tokenizer which we

[10:06:56 - 10:06:59]
have over here it takes in the model

[10:06:58 - 10:07:01]
right and we have our question or our

[10:06:59 - 10:07:03]
context so in our tokenizer we're

[10:07:01 - 10:07:05]
passing our question and context and

[10:07:03 - 10:07:07]
we're tokenizing our inputs or like our

[10:07:05 - 10:07:08]
information or question or context to

[10:07:07 - 10:07:10]
get backer

[10:07:08 - 10:07:13]
inputs

[10:07:10 - 10:07:17]
uh I'm not sure what this does get model

[10:07:13 - 10:07:19]
predictions okay that makes sense um

[10:07:17 - 10:07:21]
find and start the end positions I don't

[10:07:19 - 10:07:26]
know why we need to do that but that's

[10:07:21 - 10:07:28]
okay um convert token positions to

[10:07:26 - 10:07:31]
string okay so I don't fully understand

[10:07:28 - 10:07:33]
it but like I kind of do but uh we'll go

[10:07:31 - 10:07:35]
to the next one here and so the part

[10:07:33 - 10:07:37]
that we care about is this code so we'll

[10:07:35 - 10:07:39]
grabb this here and since we're doing

[10:07:37 - 10:07:40]
this all they don't know that we're

[10:07:39 - 10:07:43]
doing this in a notebook that's why

[10:07:40 - 10:07:46]
they're giving us functions and

[10:07:43 - 10:07:48]
stuff okay so here we load the model we

[10:07:46 - 10:07:50]
have our context who created Python and

[10:07:48 - 10:07:53]
then we can see if it works

[10:07:50 - 10:07:55]
so run it torch is not

[10:07:53 - 10:07:59]
defined

[10:07:55 - 10:08:02]
um sure we will import

[10:07:59 - 10:08:07]
torch way way up

[10:08:02 - 10:08:07]
here let's go on a new line here import

[10:08:08 - 10:08:13]
torch there we go go all the way back

[10:08:11 - 10:08:13]
down the

[10:08:15 - 10:08:19]
ground and we'll run

[10:08:18 - 10:08:22]
that and look at that that so we have

[10:08:19 - 10:08:25]
who created python 1991 so that's pretty

[10:08:22 - 10:08:28]
cool so we are able to use ber and we

[10:08:25 - 10:08:30]
trained it right with a data

[10:08:28 - 10:08:32]
set yeah I think again if I show my

[10:08:30 - 10:08:36]
friend Rola she'd be proud of me for

[10:08:32 - 10:08:37]
using a smaller model um but yeah that's

[10:08:36 - 10:08:38]
that's what we had to do there but you

[10:08:37 - 10:08:40]
can see there was a lot of little things

[10:08:38 - 10:08:41]
that we had to do to get that to work

[10:08:40 - 10:08:44]
I'm going to download this I'm going to

[10:08:41 - 10:08:47]
bring this into our repo wherever this

[10:08:44 - 10:08:48]
is and so if you need the code that it

[10:08:47 - 10:08:50]
will work just understand that you're

[10:08:48 - 10:08:52]
going to get different results on

[10:08:50 - 10:08:53]
different things and in the future it

[10:08:52 - 10:08:56]
just might not work because these things

[10:08:53 - 10:08:57]
break really easily you have to have

[10:08:56 - 10:08:59]
confidence to try to work through these

[10:08:57 - 10:09:01]
things to get them to work so say data

[10:08:59 - 10:09:05]
sets example hugging

[10:09:01 - 10:09:08]
face okay um is there anything else to

[10:09:05 - 10:09:10]
show in hugging face probably there's so

[10:09:08 - 10:09:12]
much in here um but what I'd probably do

[10:09:10 - 10:09:14]
is go to docs

[10:09:12 - 10:09:17]
here Transformers I I haven't really

[10:09:14 - 10:09:18]
used diffusers well sorry I have used

[10:09:17 - 10:09:21]
diffusers not just hugging face

[10:09:18 - 10:09:23]
diffusers and that's image Generation Um

[10:09:21 - 10:09:25]
so maybe we'll look at it there's also

[10:09:23 - 10:09:28]
Transformers JS state of the-art machine

[10:09:25 - 10:09:31]
learning for the web um I think that is

[10:09:28 - 10:09:33]
just a wrapper I believe we have PFT

[10:09:31 - 10:09:35]
which is for parameter efficient fine

[10:09:33 - 10:09:37]
tuning which we might do later we have

[10:09:35 - 10:09:39]
TGI which we might do later we have

[10:09:37 - 10:09:42]
Optimum which we will definitely do

[10:09:39 - 10:09:43]
later um we have evaluate so there's a

[10:09:42 - 10:09:44]
lot of these things I think we're just

[10:09:43 - 10:09:47]
going to come back to these when we need

[10:09:44 - 10:09:50]
them um because there's just so much

[10:09:47 - 10:09:51]
right so I mean that it probably gives

[10:09:50 - 10:09:53]
you kind of an idea of how to start

[10:09:51 - 10:09:54]
working with hugging face so hopefully

[10:09:53 - 10:09:56]
that is pretty clear we didn't show you

[10:09:54 - 10:09:58]
how to upload or push your own models or

[10:09:56 - 10:10:01]
stuff like that I'm not really worried

[10:09:58 - 10:10:03]
about that right now um but yeah there

[10:10:01 - 10:10:07]
you go that is hugging

[10:10:03 - 10:10:10]
[Music]

[10:10:07 - 10:10:11]
face olama is a large language model

[10:10:10 - 10:10:14]
manager that makes it easy to download

[10:10:11 - 10:10:16]
install and run LMS on your laptop or

[10:10:14 - 10:10:20]
desktop you can find the GitHub repo

[10:10:16 - 10:10:22]
here um AMA can run models directly in

[10:10:20 - 10:10:23]
its own runtime environment each model

[10:10:22 - 10:10:25]
self-contained so no complex

[10:10:23 - 10:10:27]
dependencies the downloader installer

[10:10:25 - 10:10:29]
and you get going on Windows and Mac

[10:10:27 - 10:10:32]
probably has Linux as well but I didn't

[10:10:29 - 10:10:34]
check AMA can easily download updates

[10:10:32 - 10:10:36]
for models uh what you'll do is you'll

[10:10:34 - 10:10:40]
go to the website and you'll see exactly

[10:10:36 - 10:10:42]
what command you need to do to run or uh

[10:10:40 - 10:10:44]
serve the model after your installation

[10:10:42 - 10:10:47]
so you primarily use this via the

[10:10:44 - 10:10:48]
command line there's no UI but there are

[10:10:47 - 10:10:50]
other open source projects that you can

[10:10:48 - 10:10:53]
pair with an interface so you can get

[10:10:50 - 10:10:56]
like a full chat TPT experience but here

[10:10:53 - 10:10:57]
you can see I want to run llama 3.2 1

[10:10:56 - 10:10:59]
billion parameter it's going to download

[10:10:57 - 10:11:01]
the model and then serve it and then I

[10:10:59 - 10:11:06]
can talk to it I'm doing this all on my

[10:11:01 - 10:11:08]
Mac M1 uh which is not a a very recent

[10:11:06 - 10:11:11]
um uh computer so you can see that you

[10:11:08 - 10:11:12]
can uh do this on last gen Hardware no

[10:11:11 - 10:11:16]
problem

[10:11:12 - 10:11:18]
[Music]

[10:11:16 - 10:11:20]
okay hey this is Andrew Brown in this

[10:11:18 - 10:11:22]
video I want to explain for olama so

[10:11:20 - 10:11:24]
olama is a way of downloading and

[10:11:22 - 10:11:25]
serving models and the idea is that it

[10:11:24 - 10:11:27]
makes it super easy for local

[10:11:25 - 10:11:29]
development probably not something you

[10:11:27 - 10:11:31]
would use in production um I'm sure some

[10:11:29 - 10:11:33]
people would try to do that uh but yeah

[10:11:31 - 10:11:34]
it's just supposed to be if like you

[10:11:33 - 10:11:38]
really aren't comfortable with using

[10:11:34 - 10:11:40]
hugging phase um or you know downloading

[10:11:38 - 10:11:42]
models that this will save you a lot of

[10:11:40 - 10:11:45]
time and it works for very specific

[10:11:42 - 10:11:46]
models okay um but anyway my local

[10:11:45 - 10:11:49]
computer is not the best and so I don't

[10:11:46 - 10:11:53]
really want to install AMA here as my C

[10:11:49 - 10:11:55]
U is from 2016 my my gpus are fine but

[10:11:53 - 10:11:57]
um you know I still don't really want to

[10:11:55 - 10:12:00]
run it on this computer uh however I do

[10:11:57 - 10:12:02]
have a Intel lunar Lake developer kit

[10:12:00 - 10:12:04]
and so I would like to utilize that

[10:12:02 - 10:12:05]
because the uh processing power on that

[10:12:04 - 10:12:08]
even though it's a mobile chip is

[10:12:05 - 10:12:11]
amazing so I'm going to go ahead and

[10:12:08 - 10:12:14]
open up RDP uh as I've connected that to

[10:12:11 - 10:12:17]
my local um Network so I strongly

[10:12:14 - 10:12:19]
recommend that you know if you need to

[10:12:17 - 10:12:22]
invest into

[10:12:19 - 10:12:23]
uh more local hardware just buy the mini

[10:12:22 - 10:12:25]
computers and attach them to your net

[10:12:23 - 10:12:28]
Network because buying a full laptop

[10:12:25 - 10:12:30]
might be $2,000 whereas purchasing a

[10:12:28 - 10:12:32]
mini computer might be $500 and then you

[10:12:30 - 10:12:33]
just utilize your existing computer but

[10:12:32 - 10:12:35]
you'd have to learn a little bit about

[10:12:33 - 10:12:37]
networking however I got a co-founder

[10:12:35 - 10:12:39]
named B so if I got a problem with RDP

[10:12:37 - 10:12:42]
he'll help me with it but I'm connecting

[10:12:39 - 10:12:44]
here as a user um on that machine uh my

[10:12:42 - 10:12:45]
my computer's named lunar lake so that

[10:12:44 - 10:12:48]
makes it easy for me I'm going to go

[10:12:45 - 10:12:49]
ahead and remote into that machine we'll

[10:12:48 - 10:12:52]
go ahead and say yes and so I'm

[10:12:49 - 10:12:54]
connecting to it and here we are another

[10:12:52 - 10:12:57]
thing is that like I can run a Jupiter

[10:12:54 - 10:12:58]
lab here and so if I have a models I

[10:12:57 - 10:13:00]
want to use compute here on this

[10:12:58 - 10:13:02]
computer I can connect it uh through

[10:13:00 - 10:13:05]
Jupiter lab I don't have to RDP but RDP

[10:13:02 - 10:13:07]
is pretty good remote desktop um for for

[10:13:05 - 10:13:09]
Windows to Windows here obviously

[10:13:07 - 10:13:10]
Windows 11 here my old one's window

[10:13:09 - 10:13:13]
Windows 10 I'd love to have Windows 11

[10:13:10 - 10:13:16]
on my new on my other computer but it's

[10:13:13 - 10:13:19]
just uh I don't have the the the TPM

[10:13:16 - 10:13:21]
chip in my um it's the tamperproof it's

[10:13:19 - 10:13:22]
the security module chip so I'm stuck on

[10:13:21 - 10:13:26]
Windows 10 so I've actually already

[10:13:22 - 10:13:29]
installed AMA here because I had a bad

[10:13:26 - 10:13:31]
uh a bad take and I had to restart I had

[10:13:29 - 10:13:33]
it paused and I missed a lot of footage

[10:13:31 - 10:13:35]
but anyway I'm going to just show you uh

[10:13:33 - 10:13:37]
the steps that I did here um it was very

[10:13:35 - 10:13:39]
straightforward so I went to olama you

[10:13:37 - 10:13:40]
have this where you download it you have

[10:13:39 - 10:13:42]
mac Linux or Windows you're going to

[10:13:40 - 10:13:45]
download it that's going to give you the

[10:13:42 - 10:13:47]
downloaded file here okay you're going

[10:13:45 - 10:13:50]
to install it it's going to start up

[10:13:47 - 10:13:51]
here okay and it doesn't have an

[10:13:50 - 10:13:56]
interface it might I don't know if it

[10:13:51 - 10:13:56]
ama has a like AMA desktop is that a

[10:13:56 - 10:14:02]
thing is there no I think it's console

[10:14:00 - 10:14:04]
only but what I'm going to do is open up

[10:14:02 - 10:14:08]
terminal and so as long as this thing is

[10:14:04 - 10:14:10]
running down below here we can type in

[10:14:08 - 10:14:12]
ama okay and if it it didn't we could

[10:14:10 - 10:14:14]
type in ama serve to start AMA but it's

[10:14:12 - 10:14:16]
already running because I can see it

[10:14:14 - 10:14:19]
down below here and so if we want to

[10:14:16 - 10:14:21]
download a model it's uh what we can do

[10:14:19 - 10:14:25]
is go back over to

[10:14:21 - 10:14:29]
here to oh llama and we go to models and

[10:14:25 - 10:14:30]
we have llama 3.3 it's 70 billion

[10:14:29 - 10:14:33]
parameters which is

[10:14:30 - 10:14:36]
giant um but let's start with something

[10:14:33 - 10:14:38]
small let's try with llama this is 3.1

[10:14:36 - 10:14:42]
but I'm going to go with llama

[10:14:38 - 10:14:43]
3.2 and I'm not married to llama 3.2

[10:14:42 - 10:14:45]
it's just the fact that it's so small

[10:14:43 - 10:14:47]
and easy to run that I I like to use it

[10:14:45 - 10:14:50]
as as examples for the time being let's

[10:14:47 - 10:14:52]
go ahead and run that so it's going to

[10:14:50 - 10:14:53]
download the model and then it's going

[10:14:52 - 10:14:58]
to serve the model now we can use

[10:14:53 - 10:14:59]
hugging face we can use uh VMS and TGI

[10:14:58 - 10:15:01]
and stuff like that but this just makes

[10:14:59 - 10:15:04]
it really really easy you can also um

[10:15:01 - 10:15:06]
programmatically interact with uh AMA

[10:15:04 - 10:15:07]
and we don't see an example here but

[10:15:06 - 10:15:09]
we'll see it later on so this is

[10:15:07 - 10:15:10]
downloading the 1 billion parameter

[10:15:09 - 10:15:14]
model it's obviously not going to take

[10:15:10 - 10:15:17]
very long to do we'll say hello how are

[10:15:14 - 10:15:20]
you who are or we'll say who are you and

[10:15:17 - 10:15:21]
we'll get get a reply back and so very

[10:15:20 - 10:15:24]
good accurate thing here if we type in

[10:15:21 - 10:15:25]
for slash we can see that we have uh

[10:15:24 - 10:15:26]
some actions here so I'm going to just

[10:15:25 - 10:15:28]
say

[10:15:26 - 10:15:31]
buy okay you can load the session

[10:15:28 - 10:15:33]
restart it over set some variables I'm

[10:15:31 - 10:15:35]
going to type in ama and what I want to

[10:15:33 - 10:15:36]
do here is just list out the ones I have

[10:15:35 - 10:15:38]
I'm going to go ahead and just delete

[10:15:36 - 10:15:41]
this because these do take up space and

[10:15:38 - 10:15:43]
you don't want to fill up your drive um

[10:15:41 - 10:15:45]
this computer here again is a lunar Lake

[10:15:43 - 10:15:50]
until developer kit so it's not the

[10:15:45 - 10:15:51]
biggest thing uh but it is uh it is very

[10:15:50 - 10:15:54]
very powerful it's more powerful than my

[10:15:51 - 10:15:57]
my my last generation graphics card um

[10:15:54 - 10:15:59]
and so you know what's interesting about

[10:15:57 - 10:16:01]
this is just the fact that this could be

[10:15:59 - 10:16:04]
in a phone like I just think of this

[10:16:01 - 10:16:05]
machine as the capabilities of a phone

[10:16:04 - 10:16:08]
and having that local compute just like

[10:16:05 - 10:16:11]
blows your mind you know I can run llama

[10:16:08 - 10:16:13]
3.21 billion I can run mol 7 uh it's

[10:16:11 - 10:16:16]
unbelievable here but we just deleted

[10:16:13 - 10:16:19]
this one here let's go back over to here

[10:16:16 - 10:16:20]
and we'll go to models okay okay I want

[10:16:19 - 10:16:22]
to try something else like mistol so

[10:16:20 - 10:16:24]
mistol is a little bit larger it's

[10:16:22 - 10:16:27]
chunkier this thing uh would hang and

[10:16:24 - 10:16:29]
cause problems on my on my other machine

[10:16:27 - 10:16:32]
my older machine um could I run this on

[10:16:29 - 10:16:35]
a macm one probably not no but let's go

[10:16:32 - 10:16:39]
ahead and run mistol so this is mistal 7

[10:16:35 - 10:16:43]
and it's about uh 4 gigabytes in

[10:16:39 - 10:16:45]
size okay and so we'll give it a moment

[10:16:43 - 10:16:49]
here to download and run so I'll be back

[10:16:45 - 10:16:51]
in just a moment all right so

[10:16:49 - 10:16:53]
um it's now uh downlo let's go ahead and

[10:16:51 - 10:16:55]
talk to it so say

[10:16:53 - 10:17:00]
hello who are

[10:16:55 - 10:17:02]
you and that's really really good says

[10:17:00 - 10:17:03]
hello I'm moo a friendly and helpful AI

[10:17:02 - 10:17:06]
designed to assist you with various

[10:17:03 - 10:17:09]
tasks I don't think it's called Mo I I

[10:17:06 - 10:17:09]
thought I thought you were

[10:17:10 - 10:17:13]
mistol

[10:17:14 - 10:17:19]
okay oh m m Mr both ey models developed

[10:17:18 - 10:17:22]
by Mr ey but they serve the same purpose

[10:17:19 - 10:17:24]
Miko's general purpose assistant like me

[10:17:22 - 10:17:26]
designed to assist users I did not know

[10:17:24 - 10:17:28]
that while mol is the large scale model

[10:17:26 - 10:17:30]
focus on Jing text that can be used in

[10:17:28 - 10:17:33]
applications okay that's pretty cool so

[10:17:30 - 10:17:34]
yeah I'm I'm really impressed uh but

[10:17:33 - 10:17:36]
it's just like it's crazy to me to think

[10:17:34 - 10:17:39]
that this could be something that could

[10:17:36 - 10:17:41]
be on your mobile phone locally right

[10:17:39 - 10:17:43]
and so I think what's really important

[10:17:41 - 10:17:46]
to think about this is like if you are

[10:17:43 - 10:17:48]
uh uh building out apps um you know CU

[10:17:46 - 10:17:52]
again like this stuff is really

[10:17:48 - 10:17:54]
expensive run right now using serverless

[10:17:52 - 10:17:55]
models is inexpensive but these these

[10:17:54 - 10:17:58]
companies are losing a lot of money so

[10:17:55 - 10:17:59]
if we can shift or move this compute

[10:17:58 - 10:18:02]
locally then you could be building apps

[10:17:59 - 10:18:05]
and trying to tap into what you can plug

[10:18:02 - 10:18:07]
in on your local phones or you know your

[10:18:05 - 10:18:09]
smaller device so that's kind of really

[10:18:07 - 10:18:11]
cool but I'm going to go ahead and I'm

[10:18:09 - 10:18:14]
just going to say bye to this and I

[10:18:11 - 10:18:16]
would love to try out quen so quen with

[10:18:14 - 10:18:17]
questions that's the the latest hot

[10:18:16 - 10:18:18]
model it's the Chinese model it's

[10:18:17 - 10:18:21]
supposed to be really good it's a 32

[10:18:18 - 10:18:22]
billion parameter model um I think they

[10:18:21 - 10:18:25]
have a larger one as well and we saw

[10:18:22 - 10:18:26]
llama 3.3 which is 70 billion parameters

[10:18:25 - 10:18:29]
I don't know if I want to try that one

[10:18:26 - 10:18:31]
but 32 billion I think that I'd like to

[10:18:29 - 10:18:35]
see if it if if this machine grocs or or

[10:18:31 - 10:18:38]
croaks on it it's not designed to to run

[10:18:35 - 10:18:40]
super giant models but I want to just

[10:18:38 - 10:18:41]
push it to its limits but I'm just again

[10:18:40 - 10:18:45]
impressed that we could impressed that

[10:18:41 - 10:18:47]
we can run mistal 7 or llama llama 3.21

[10:18:45 - 10:18:49]
billion it could handle three billion

[10:18:47 - 10:18:51]
and S billion no problem but it's just

[10:18:49 - 10:18:52]
the fact that um you know like if I

[10:18:51 - 10:18:54]
wanted to build a language learning app

[10:18:52 - 10:18:56]
I don't have to I could just build it on

[10:18:54 - 10:18:58]
my machine here and I could use this as

[10:18:56 - 10:19:00]
opposed to uh worrying about whether I

[10:18:58 - 10:19:02]
have internet or things like that anyway

[10:19:00 - 10:19:04]
let's go ahead and delete this model

[10:19:02 - 10:19:06]
because it's a little bit large it's not

[10:19:04 - 10:19:08]
that big but it's this thing these

[10:19:06 - 10:19:10]
things catch up to me here and this

[10:19:08 - 10:19:13]
drive I don't have a lot of space on it

[10:19:10 - 10:19:14]
um so I'm going to go ahead and just say

[10:19:13 - 10:19:17]
remove and we're going to get rid of

[10:19:14 - 10:19:20]
that and I want to go ahead and try quen

[10:19:17 - 10:19:22]
so it's crazy but we're going to do it

[10:19:20 - 10:19:25]
so I'm going to go over to here and it's

[10:19:22 - 10:19:27]
Q with questions quen with questions um

[10:19:25 - 10:19:30]
and let's go

[10:19:27 - 10:19:32]
ahead and letter rip there's only a 32

[10:19:30 - 10:19:33]
billion parameter ones available on here

[10:19:32 - 10:19:35]
that doesn't mean that there aren't

[10:19:33 - 10:19:38]
other ones it's just what AMA has

[10:19:35 - 10:19:40]
available to it that has been optimized

[10:19:38 - 10:19:41]
and whatever whatever whatever you can

[10:19:40 - 10:19:44]
see actually I was downloading it before

[10:19:41 - 10:19:45]
because this is my second take and so I

[10:19:44 - 10:19:47]
don't have to wait as long here but I'll

[10:19:45 - 10:19:49]
wait here a little bit and then we'll

[10:19:47 - 10:19:52]
give it a go okay all right so it's done

[10:19:49 - 10:19:54]
downloading it's loaded I just feel like

[10:19:52 - 10:19:56]
this should be not be able to run on

[10:19:54 - 10:20:02]
this machine but let's find out so say

[10:19:56 - 10:20:02]
hello how are you or let's say who are

[10:20:05 - 10:20:13]
you and we'll give it a moment

[10:20:09 - 10:20:16]
here I can hear the Intel developer kit

[10:20:13 - 10:20:18]
spinning up and the fans are

[10:20:16 - 10:20:20]
going yeah so this one this one's a

[10:20:18 - 10:20:23]
little a little bit hard for it okay it

[10:20:20 - 10:20:27]
does run oh Alibaba Cloud made I didn't

[10:20:23 - 10:20:29]
know that okay so it does work but it's

[10:20:27 - 10:20:33]
a little bit too much for this machine

[10:20:29 - 10:20:35]
okay so we can use it but uh this is

[10:20:33 - 10:20:37]
where we say bye-bye okay so that one

[10:20:35 - 10:20:39]
was fun I couldn't believe we did that

[10:20:37 - 10:20:41]
um but the question would be like okay

[10:20:39 - 10:20:42]
we're running this locally how can we

[10:20:41 - 10:20:44]
programmatically work with this because

[10:20:42 - 10:20:46]
the idea is that if you don't want to

[10:20:44 - 10:20:48]
work with hugging face and figure how to

[10:20:46 - 10:20:49]
serve models which by the way is not

[10:20:48 - 10:20:52]
that hard this is supposed to be an easy

[10:20:49 - 10:20:53]
way to work with it so uh before we uh

[10:20:52 - 10:20:55]
look at the programmatic way I just want

[10:20:53 - 10:20:57]
to get rid of that model that we just

[10:20:55 - 10:21:02]
downloaded because it's really big and

[10:20:57 - 10:21:02]
so we'll go ahead and we'll say ol llama

[10:21:02 - 10:21:06]
remove CL with questions okay so that

[10:21:04 - 10:21:09]
one's deleted I'm just type in clear

[10:21:06 - 10:21:12]
here and so there was one here that kind

[10:21:09 - 10:21:13]
of stood out to me 3.2 Vision but so far

[10:21:12 - 10:21:15]
we've been working with text how would

[10:21:13 - 10:21:19]
we load an image in here we wouldn't be

[10:21:15 - 10:21:22]
able to right and so um what I notice

[10:21:19 - 10:21:24]
here is that we can we uh we can use the

[10:21:22 - 10:21:25]
ol llama python library to interact that

[10:21:24 - 10:21:29]
way so I'm going to go ahead and and

[10:21:25 - 10:21:30]
we'll pull this we'll say ol Lama pull

[10:21:29 - 10:21:32]
the other one was run we're just pulling

[10:21:30 - 10:21:35]
the image right because we're not going

[10:21:32 - 10:21:38]
to uh use it the same way right and

[10:21:35 - 10:21:40]
we'll download it that way um you know I

[10:21:38 - 10:21:42]
think we' have to run though but maybe

[10:21:40 - 10:21:43]
not so here they have a chat I'm trying

[10:21:42 - 10:21:45]
to decide how I'm going to do this on

[10:21:43 - 10:21:48]
this machine because this uses

[10:21:45 - 10:21:49]
WSL um locally but we'll just see we'll

[10:21:48 - 10:21:53]
just try this out so I'm going to go

[10:21:49 - 10:21:55]
ahead and go over to VSS code VSS

[10:21:53 - 10:21:58]
code oh this is definitely

[10:21:55 - 10:22:01]
installed is it not installed maybe I

[10:21:58 - 10:22:04]
did it on another another user vs

[10:22:01 - 10:22:06]
code well if it's not installed let's go

[10:22:04 - 10:22:06]
ahead install right

[10:22:07 - 10:22:11]
now okay we'll go ahead and say well it

[10:22:10 - 10:22:13]
says it has to be as administrator so

[10:22:11 - 10:22:16]
let me go find this again vs

[10:22:13 - 10:22:19]
code I got multiple users so I'm a bit

[10:22:16 - 10:22:21]
confused what is what

[10:22:19 - 10:22:23]
yeah okay I said that it would be that

[10:22:21 - 10:22:26]
we'll go ahead and install

[10:22:23 - 10:22:29]
that yeah I'll create a desktop

[10:22:26 - 10:22:31]
icon I know I have I have a few

[10:22:29 - 10:22:34]
different users so I get kind of mixed

[10:22:31 - 10:22:37]
up what has what in them um so hopefully

[10:22:34 - 10:22:41]
it's fine what I'm doing over

[10:22:37 - 10:22:43]
here we'll go ahead and launch vs

[10:22:41 - 10:22:45]
code and yeah this one's still

[10:22:43 - 10:22:50]
downloading the background which is fine

[10:22:45 - 10:22:50]
but what I need here is I need

[10:22:51 - 10:22:57]
um

[10:22:53 - 10:23:00]
wsl2 so I do have WSL already installed

[10:22:57 - 10:23:02]
here and we will install the extension

[10:23:00 - 10:23:03]
so I'm not showing you how to install

[10:23:02 - 10:23:05]
WSL that's kind of a pain to do on your

[10:23:03 - 10:23:07]
Windows machine you'll have to look that

[10:23:05 - 10:23:08]
up yourself but it allows you to have a

[10:23:07 - 10:23:10]
Linux like environment and it's really

[10:23:08 - 10:23:12]
what you're going to be

[10:23:10 - 10:23:13]
using okay so that one's almost already

[10:23:12 - 10:23:15]
done downloading and while that's going

[10:23:13 - 10:23:17]
I'm going to make a new um a new Pro a

[10:23:15 - 10:23:19]
new folder

[10:23:17 - 10:23:24]
here I like having a sites directory so

[10:23:19 - 10:23:27]
I'm going to go over to here into uh

[10:23:24 - 10:23:29]
this

[10:23:27 - 10:23:32]
PC how do I get to this user is it this

[10:23:29 - 10:23:37]
user here no that's

[10:23:32 - 10:23:37]
Ubuntu um my home

[10:23:39 - 10:23:44]
here okay I'll just create on my desktop

[10:23:42 - 10:23:45]
usually there's like a user folder but

[10:23:44 - 10:23:47]
I'm not sure where it is here I'm just

[10:23:45 - 10:23:49]
going to say projects or sites I like

[10:23:47 - 10:23:50]
calling it sit

[10:23:49 - 10:23:52]
and um in here we're just going to have

[10:23:50 - 10:23:56]
a simple example so this going to be

[10:23:52 - 10:23:58]
another folder and this will be uh ol

[10:23:56 - 10:24:02]
llama co uh code

[10:23:58 - 10:24:03]
right and so what I want to do here is I

[10:24:02 - 10:24:06]
want to go back over to vs code and I

[10:24:03 - 10:24:10]
want to open this folder so we go here

[10:24:06 - 10:24:13]
open folder on our desktop in our sites

[10:24:10 - 10:24:16]
in ALA code and we'll select the folder

[10:24:13 - 10:24:18]
so now we're in that folder okay and I'm

[10:24:16 - 10:24:21]
going to make a new file here and this

[10:24:18 - 10:24:25]
is going to be uh ol Lama or

[10:24:21 - 10:24:26]
basic basic. py okay so nothing fancy

[10:24:25 - 10:24:28]
we're just going to use l the code that

[10:24:26 - 10:24:29]
was provided to us I don't need to put

[10:24:28 - 10:24:31]
this in a repo because there's not

[10:24:29 - 10:24:32]
enough going on here to be exciting but

[10:24:31 - 10:24:34]
I'm going to go ahead and grab this code

[10:24:32 - 10:24:37]
here and I'm going to paste it in here

[10:24:34 - 10:24:39]
okay so it should know to connect to our

[10:24:37 - 10:24:40]
model here and we need to provide it an

[10:24:39 - 10:24:43]
image there's no image here so I need to

[10:24:40 - 10:24:45]
go grab an image and so I'm going to go

[10:24:43 - 10:24:49]
grab something what's something that's

[10:24:45 - 10:24:53]
cool uh that's not copyrighted um um uh

[10:24:49 - 10:24:53]
public domain

[10:24:54 - 10:24:58]
image let's go

[10:24:58 - 10:25:05]
here and here we have a horse that looks

[10:25:02 - 10:25:07]
good so bring that over into sites and

[10:25:05 - 10:25:10]
then we'll bring we'll just rename this

[10:25:07 - 10:25:13]
to image okay and I'll bring that over

[10:25:10 - 10:25:14]
here I like how I spelled that wrong but

[10:25:13 - 10:25:17]
I don't think that really matters we all

[10:25:14 - 10:25:19]
know that I tried to spell AMA right and

[10:25:17 - 10:25:21]
so we'll go back over here and so this

[10:25:19 - 10:25:23]
is hooked up the model is downloaded

[10:25:21 - 10:25:24]
it's not we didn't say to run it so I'm

[10:25:23 - 10:25:27]
not sure how that's going to work but

[10:25:24 - 10:25:31]
I'm going to go ahead and we will bring

[10:25:27 - 10:25:33]
this over a little bit we'll say new

[10:25:31 - 10:25:36]
terminal and we'll say

[10:25:33 - 10:25:38]
Python basic. piy and we'll go ahead and

[10:25:36 - 10:25:41]
try to run that so it says no module

[10:25:38 - 10:25:42]
called that so we'll say pip install uh

[10:25:41 - 10:25:44]
I'll make a requirements.txt in here

[10:25:42 - 10:25:46]
requirements.txt

[10:25:44 - 10:25:51]
I can't believe how good I'm getting

[10:25:46 - 10:25:51]
with um python I don't even like

[10:25:53 - 10:25:57]
python there we go we'll go ahead and

[10:25:55 - 10:25:59]
install that so that's the most basic

[10:25:57 - 10:26:01]
thing that we need and I'm just hoping

[10:25:59 - 10:26:03]
it's going to connect to that um there

[10:26:01 - 10:26:04]
and start it up so now let's go ahead

[10:26:03 - 10:26:07]
and run

[10:26:04 - 10:26:10]
it and it looks like we're not even

[10:26:07 - 10:26:12]
running this in WSL I mean if it works I

[10:26:10 - 10:26:18]
guess I don't care but we should really

[10:26:12 - 10:26:18]
run this in um in uh WSL

[10:26:19 - 10:26:24]
so yeah I can hear the I can hear the

[10:26:22 - 10:26:26]
the other the Intel spinning up so it

[10:26:24 - 10:26:29]
must be

[10:26:26 - 10:26:29]
working

[10:26:32 - 10:26:37]
right but nothing's happen so

[10:26:35 - 10:26:38]
far so I'm not sure if this is like a

[10:26:37 - 10:26:39]
hard thing for it to run I'm going go

[10:26:38 - 10:26:43]
here and say

[10:26:39 - 10:26:43]
hello just so I know that it's doing

[10:26:46 - 10:26:52]
something and I don't hear again I don't

[10:26:49 - 10:26:54]
see or hear anything um so I'm going to

[10:26:52 - 10:26:58]
stop this can I even stop

[10:26:54 - 10:26:58]
this I can't even stop

[10:26:59 - 10:27:03]
it so what I'm going to

[10:27:04 - 10:27:09]
do yeah I think that's hang so I'm going

[10:27:06 - 10:27:11]
to kill it I'm going to reopen AMA I

[10:27:09 - 10:27:12]
think we could also start it from AMA

[10:27:11 - 10:27:14]
serve but I'm going to go ahead and

[10:27:12 - 10:27:16]
switch over to a bun of WSL because I

[10:27:14 - 10:27:19]
don't I don't want to run in power shell

[10:27:16 - 10:27:23]
and so I'm going to do Ama

[10:27:19 - 10:27:23]
serve old llama

[10:27:26 - 10:27:31]
serve

[10:27:28 - 10:27:34]
AMA okay so it doesn't know about AMA

[10:27:31 - 10:27:34]
here

[10:27:35 - 10:27:40]
H because it's installed over here so

[10:27:38 - 10:27:40]
how would it

[10:27:41 - 10:27:46]
know uh cuz then I'd have to install it

[10:27:44 - 10:27:47]
over here and then download it again I

[10:27:46 - 10:27:49]
guess we could do that if we want to use

[10:27:47 - 10:27:51]
it with within

[10:27:49 - 10:27:53]
WSL I'm going to just try to I'm going

[10:27:51 - 10:27:56]
to try this

[10:27:53 - 10:27:57]
again but what I'm going to do this time

[10:27:56 - 10:27:59]
around is I'm actually going to also

[10:27:57 - 10:28:02]
download that other model that we have

[10:27:59 - 10:28:02]
which was the olama

[10:28:03 - 10:28:06]
3.1

[10:28:04 - 10:28:09]
okay I actually don't want to run it I

[10:28:06 - 10:28:09]
just want to download

[10:28:12 - 10:28:16]
it I'm just going to adjust this code a

[10:28:14 - 10:28:18]
little bit so uh for this obviously this

[10:28:16 - 10:28:20]
is for uh that one there so going to go

[10:28:18 - 10:28:24]
make a new file here and this will be uh

[10:28:20 - 10:28:24]
chat dopy and this one's going to be

[10:28:25 - 10:28:32]
um uh image. py okay so this will be

[10:28:30 - 10:28:34]
copied over here I mean they're both a

[10:28:32 - 10:28:38]
chat but one is more going to be just

[10:28:34 - 10:28:41]
chat chat and so this one will be llama

[10:28:38 - 10:28:44]
3.21 uh

[10:28:41 - 10:28:48]
1B okay and just

[10:28:44 - 10:28:51]
say hello

[10:28:48 - 10:28:54]
who are you right and so I'm hoping that

[10:28:51 - 10:28:58]
this will just

[10:28:54 - 10:29:00]
work I'm going to just type in um back

[10:28:58 - 10:29:01]
slby okay and so we're going to try this

[10:29:00 - 10:29:06]
again we're going to say

[10:29:01 - 10:29:06]
python uh chat

[10:29:06 - 10:29:10]
dopy oh yeah yeah W cell doesn't have

[10:29:09 - 10:29:14]
anything installed so we go over here

[10:29:10 - 10:29:16]
python chat. py again I don't normally

[10:29:14 - 10:29:18]
run it this way but we did get output

[10:29:16 - 10:29:21]
back and so here it's saying yeah so

[10:29:18 - 10:29:24]
this one worked fine okay but it kind of

[10:29:21 - 10:29:28]
messed up on this one and I might be my

[10:29:24 - 10:29:30]
code right um the image is here it's

[10:29:28 - 10:29:33]
local maybe just it's just too too hard

[10:29:30 - 10:29:36]
for it to do let's try this

[10:29:33 - 10:29:38]
again and we do get information back

[10:29:36 - 10:29:39]
that was my stomach by the way if you

[10:29:38 - 10:29:42]
heard

[10:29:39 - 10:29:44]
it okay and let's just hang on here and

[10:29:42 - 10:29:46]
see if it actually uh brings anything

[10:29:44 - 10:29:49]
back we'll we'll give it some

[10:29:46 - 10:29:50]
time yeah again I can hear spinning up

[10:29:49 - 10:29:52]
there's probably some way to monitor it

[10:29:50 - 10:29:56]
so there are these tools over here I

[10:29:52 - 10:29:59]
don't know how to use them but um is it

[10:29:56 - 10:30:02]
like dis what is it called uh

[10:29:59 - 10:30:02]
system uh

[10:30:02 - 10:30:06]
monitor it performance

[10:30:11 - 10:30:16]
monitor I can't remember what's called

[10:30:12 - 10:30:19]
on a on a Windows machine oh uh task

[10:30:16 - 10:30:21]
manager task manager there we go

[10:30:19 - 10:30:24]
and so what I'm looking at here is our

[10:30:21 - 10:30:28]
usage and so we have 82%

[10:30:24 - 10:30:30]
77% um usage here going on right

[10:30:28 - 10:30:32]
now I'm not used to this interface it's

[10:30:30 - 10:30:34]
a little bit different

[10:30:32 - 10:30:36]
performance oh here we go that's a bit

[10:30:34 - 10:30:39]
more normal so his CPU is really high

[10:30:36 - 10:30:41]
memory is really high um so I think it

[10:30:39 - 10:30:43]
is it's doing something

[10:30:41 - 10:30:45]
but I guess we'll have to wait a little

[10:30:43 - 10:30:46]
bit like how large was that it wasn't I

[10:30:45 - 10:30:49]
don't even know if it was that

[10:30:46 - 10:30:52]
big um so so I'm a little bit confused

[10:30:49 - 10:30:55]
let's go back over here this one

[10:30:52 - 10:30:58]
is oh there's a few different sizes oh

[10:30:55 - 10:31:01]
uhoh uh so we have 11 billion parameter

[10:30:58 - 10:31:03]
one and then we have I guess it's not

[10:31:01 - 10:31:05]
actually small it's pretty

[10:31:03 - 10:31:08]
large oh

[10:31:05 - 10:31:09]
okay this is larger than mistol okay so

[10:31:08 - 10:31:11]
that that makes sense that's why it's so

[10:31:09 - 10:31:14]
slow so maybe we hit our limit here in

[10:31:11 - 10:31:15]
terms of what this machine can do now it

[10:31:14 - 10:31:17]
might produce something the memory is

[10:31:15 - 10:31:18]
really high but the question is like is

[10:31:17 - 10:31:20]
it going to be stuck here in Running In

[10:31:18 - 10:31:22]
Contention cuz here look at the memory

[10:31:20 - 10:31:26]
it says 31.6

[10:31:22 - 10:31:28]
GBS um it has 8.9 available so 22 8.9 so

[10:31:26 - 10:31:30]
it's like really at its Max and I think

[10:31:28 - 10:31:32]
the problem here is that it's the memory

[10:31:30 - 10:31:35]
limit I don't think it's a CPU I think I

[10:31:32 - 10:31:37]
just need more memory um and so yeah I

[10:31:35 - 10:31:39]
don't think this is ever going to finish

[10:31:37 - 10:31:41]
so we're just going to have to let it

[10:31:39 - 10:31:44]
go but at least we figured out how to

[10:31:41 - 10:31:46]
programmatically work with this so I

[10:31:44 - 10:31:48]
suppose I can copy this over here I mean

[10:31:46 - 10:31:50]
there's no reason I I can't

[10:31:48 - 10:31:53]
um continue to use this I just don't

[10:31:50 - 10:31:56]
know how to get it off this computer um

[10:31:53 - 10:31:57]
but anyway yeah that that isama now

[10:31:56 - 10:31:59]
there are other ways that like obviously

[10:31:57 - 10:32:01]
this is one way we can interact with it

[10:31:59 - 10:32:03]
I know another way that we can interact

[10:32:01 - 10:32:04]
with it would be like Opa I'm not sure

[10:32:03 - 10:32:07]
why anyone would want to do this but I

[10:32:04 - 10:32:10]
guess if you are a company and you are

[10:32:07 - 10:32:11]
um you have like a computer and you just

[10:32:10 - 10:32:13]
don't know how to code and stuff like

[10:32:11 - 10:32:15]
that but you know Opa I'm not sure how

[10:32:13 - 10:32:18]
you know that but not how to do that but

[10:32:15 - 10:32:22]
if you don't know Opa it is a

[10:32:18 - 10:32:25]
um it is a framework

[10:32:22 - 10:32:28]
for running gen workloads and containers

[10:32:25 - 10:32:32]
and so if we were to go

[10:32:28 - 10:32:33]
into I think comps and if I was to go

[10:32:32 - 10:32:36]
into

[10:32:33 - 10:32:39]
comps in here I should have projects a

[10:32:36 - 10:32:43]
project here for running a um llm so I

[10:32:39 - 10:32:46]
go to llm here and if we do text

[10:32:43 - 10:32:48]
generation and we go ol llama you could

[10:32:46 - 10:32:50]
use oama with Lang chain right right so

[10:32:48 - 10:32:54]
that might be a way that you use it and

[10:32:50 - 10:32:56]
so you could connect it to like a

[10:32:54 - 10:33:00]
container workload you can use Lang

[10:32:56 - 10:33:02]
chain and old Lama together but honestly

[10:33:00 - 10:33:04]
you should just spend a little bit of

[10:33:02 - 10:33:07]
time learning how to pull models and

[10:33:04 - 10:33:09]
serving them because it's so darn easy

[10:33:07 - 10:33:11]
uh but yeah I I don't really touch Lang

[10:33:09 - 10:33:14]
chain that or sorry olama much um it's

[10:33:11 - 10:33:17]
just it's nice it's just too basic for

[10:33:14 - 10:33:19]
me so um anyway what we're going to do

[10:33:17 - 10:33:22]
here is just type O llama and I'm going

[10:33:19 - 10:33:24]
to go o llama list and I just want to

[10:33:22 - 10:33:26]
get rid of that large model o Lama I got

[10:33:24 - 10:33:33]
to spell it right for it to work o Lama

[10:33:26 - 10:33:33]
list let say ol llama remove llama

[10:33:33 - 10:33:39]
3.2

[10:33:35 - 10:33:45]
1B I'll and I'll just remove this other

[10:33:39 - 10:33:48]
one B llama remove this one and there

[10:33:45 - 10:33:48]
you go that is olama

[10:33:49 - 10:33:52]
[Music]

[10:33:51 - 10:33:54]
all right let's take a look here at

[10:33:52 - 10:33:55]
llama file this is a single boning

[10:33:54 - 10:33:57]
format that contains both the model's

[10:33:55 - 10:34:00]
weights and a way to serve the model you

[10:33:57 - 10:34:01]
can find it here at this GitHub repo and

[10:34:00 - 10:34:03]
it's really as simple as that you

[10:34:01 - 10:34:05]
download the model you call like a

[10:34:03 - 10:34:07]
binary you pass it parameters and it

[10:34:05 - 10:34:11]
works um it works by combining llama CPP

[10:34:07 - 10:34:13]
and Cosmopolitan ellsy so llama CPP we

[10:34:11 - 10:34:17]
will talk about this because it is a way

[10:34:13 - 10:34:20]
to run uh models on on comput so it's

[10:34:17 - 10:34:23]
not utilizing gpus but whatever your

[10:34:20 - 10:34:27]
modern CPU processor is um and it does

[10:34:23 - 10:34:31]
that by uh uh reimplementing The Meta

[10:34:27 - 10:34:32]
The Meta meta's llama architecture for

[10:34:31 - 10:34:35]
models that are compatible with it uh

[10:34:32 - 10:34:37]
but optimized for CPU uh CPUs ridden in

[10:34:35 - 10:34:40]
C++ so it can run on multiple CPU

[10:34:37 - 10:34:42]
architectures it does support GPU use it

[10:34:40 - 10:34:43]
can run on multiple operating systems

[10:34:42 - 10:34:45]
the weights are embedded as part of the

[10:34:43 - 10:34:47]
file um so literally you just take the

[10:34:45 - 10:34:49]
file and you drop it anywhere you want

[10:34:47 - 10:34:51]
you can utilize it and it supports uh a

[10:34:49 - 10:34:53]
bunch of different packages so it's

[10:34:51 - 10:34:55]
going to be probably whatever uh uh

[10:34:53 - 10:35:00]
llama CPP can support but you can see we

[10:34:55 - 10:35:01]
have a ton here that we can utilize so

[10:35:00 - 10:35:04]
there you

[10:35:01 - 10:35:06]
[Music]

[10:35:04 - 10:35:10]
go all right let's take a look at llama

[10:35:06 - 10:35:12]
file which is by Mozilla um I honestly

[10:35:10 - 10:35:13]
haven't had many use cases for this but

[10:35:12 - 10:35:15]
it might be fun to just try it out to

[10:35:13 - 10:35:18]
see how it works but the idea is llama

[10:35:15 - 10:35:21]
file allows you to have this single

[10:35:18 - 10:35:23]
distributable file that we can utilize

[10:35:21 - 10:35:26]
so let's see if we can make that work so

[10:35:23 - 10:35:29]
here um there are very specific models

[10:35:26 - 10:35:31]
that are available so 3.21 billion is

[10:35:29 - 10:35:33]
one that I like quite a bit um so it'd

[10:35:31 - 10:35:36]
be very interesting to pull that one and

[10:35:33 - 10:35:39]
run it um if I'm going to run this I

[10:35:36 - 10:35:42]
probably should connect to my uh remote

[10:35:39 - 10:35:44]
machine so I have uh an INT Intel lunar

[10:35:42 - 10:35:46]
Lake developer kit that has more compute

[10:35:44 - 10:35:48]
on it so I'm going to just quickly

[10:35:46 - 10:35:51]
connect to that and uh let me just start

[10:35:48 - 10:35:53]
up that machine okay all right so I just

[10:35:51 - 10:35:56]
started my machine on my network I'm

[10:35:53 - 10:35:59]
going to go ahead to um a remote

[10:35:56 - 10:36:02]
desktop and connect to it now could you

[10:35:59 - 10:36:05]
do this on some kind of other compute

[10:36:02 - 10:36:06]
probably but uh I'm just feeling to use

[10:36:05 - 10:36:08]
this here today or choosing to use this

[10:36:06 - 10:36:09]
here today so I'm going to go ahead and

[10:36:08 - 10:36:12]
connect to this machine and it's just a

[10:36:09 - 10:36:17]
Windows machine that has a lunar Lake

[10:36:12 - 10:36:19]
um that has a lunar L uh processor in it

[10:36:17 - 10:36:22]
so it's as good as probably like my RTX

[10:36:19 - 10:36:25]
3060 that's sitting beside me actually

[10:36:22 - 10:36:26]
if not better uh here you can see that

[10:36:25 - 10:36:28]
the keyboard or the mouse that I have

[10:36:26 - 10:36:32]
installed is the razor one but the idea

[10:36:28 - 10:36:33]
here is that I want to go ahead and uh

[10:36:32 - 10:36:37]
navigate to llama index so we'll go

[10:36:33 - 10:36:39]
ahead here I'm going to type in llama

[10:36:37 - 10:36:42]
index and we'll go over to

[10:36:39 - 10:36:43]
here um and I just want to get started

[10:36:42 - 10:36:47]
with it oh this is llama index I meant

[10:36:43 - 10:36:47]
to say llama file

[10:36:51 - 10:36:55]
okay

[10:36:52 - 10:36:57]
and so apparently we can just download

[10:36:55 - 10:37:01]
it this one in

[10:36:57 - 10:37:04]
particular is set up for Mac it looks

[10:37:01 - 10:37:07]
like is this only for window or for Mac

[10:37:04 - 10:37:10]
let's see do we have Windows

[10:37:07 - 10:37:12]
here if you're on Windows rename the

[10:37:10 - 10:37:14]
file by adding aexe okay so it should be

[10:37:12 - 10:37:15]
as simple as that this one says this is

[10:37:14 - 10:37:18]
llama

[10:37:15 - 10:37:20]
1.57 billion for parameter I want to

[10:37:18 - 10:37:25]
download something that is

[10:37:20 - 10:37:27]
um a little bit uh more modern so like

[10:37:25 - 10:37:29]
llama 3.23 billion so I'm going to go

[10:37:27 - 10:37:32]
ahead and see if I can download

[10:37:29 - 10:37:34]
that and from here there should be some

[10:37:32 - 10:37:37]
kind of download oh okay so we'll hit

[10:37:34 - 10:37:39]
download here and so now we are

[10:37:37 - 10:37:42]
downloading the Llama

[10:37:39 - 10:37:45]
file and while that is downloading I'm

[10:37:42 - 10:37:49]
going to go back and take a look at the

[10:37:45 - 10:37:51]
instructions so if you're on Windows

[10:37:49 - 10:37:54]
rename the file by adding exe to the end

[10:37:51 - 10:37:56]
and it's as simple as that if we're on a

[10:37:54 - 10:37:59]
Mac then you do trod and technically we

[10:37:56 - 10:38:01]
have uh Windows subsystem Linux install

[10:37:59 - 10:38:03]
this machine so we could do it the Linux

[10:38:01 - 10:38:04]
way but we'll do it the windows way as

[10:38:03 - 10:38:07]
you know you should be comfortable

[10:38:04 - 10:38:09]
either or with Linux or Windows um but

[10:38:07 - 10:38:11]
we'll give that a moment to download

[10:38:09 - 10:38:14]
okay and I mean we can try to execute it

[10:38:11 - 10:38:16]
both on uh windows and uh Linux here but

[10:38:14 - 10:38:20]
we'll just focus on Windows here in the

[10:38:16 - 10:38:24]
short term so now this file should be

[10:38:20 - 10:38:24]
done should be

[10:38:24 - 10:38:29]
done okay great and so I want to find

[10:38:27 - 10:38:33]
where that file is I'm going to go to my

[10:38:29 - 10:38:35]
downloads just give me a moment here and

[10:38:33 - 10:38:41]
so I'm going to rename this as it

[10:38:35 - 10:38:43]
suggested to have Exe on the end

[10:38:41 - 10:38:45]
exe yes we'll change it so it has it and

[10:38:43 - 10:38:47]
now it's suggesting us to run it that

[10:38:45 - 10:38:50]
way so I'm going to open up terminal on

[10:38:47 - 10:38:53]
Windows 11 and this is on in my

[10:38:50 - 10:38:55]
downloads so we'll go into my downloads

[10:38:53 - 10:38:59]
here not my documents my

[10:38:55 - 10:39:02]
downloads and we have the name here so

[10:38:59 - 10:39:06]
it's usually this way when we're on uh

[10:39:02 - 10:39:08]
backlash so for Slash and so we'll go

[10:39:06 - 10:39:10]
ahead and hit enter and see if that

[10:39:08 - 10:39:13]
executes so it's launching up that's

[10:39:10 - 10:39:15]
pretty cool okay cool it's kind of like

[10:39:13 - 10:39:18]
an Olam experience very similar to the

[10:39:15 - 10:39:20]
Olam experience to be honest hello how

[10:39:18 - 10:39:20]
are

[10:39:23 - 10:39:29]
you okay that's pretty good we also have

[10:39:26 - 10:39:32]
it uh being served on a very specific um

[10:39:29 - 10:39:34]
port on Port 880 I like how it's telling

[10:39:32 - 10:39:36]
us exactly um well I don't know this is

[10:39:34 - 10:39:38]
AOL Lake this is a lunar lake so it's

[10:39:36 - 10:39:39]
interesting that it's calling AOL Lake s

[10:39:38 - 10:39:41]
unless that's another name for lunar

[10:39:39 - 10:39:43]
Lake another interesting thing is you

[10:39:41 - 10:39:46]
can see the model it's a ggf we'll

[10:39:43 - 10:39:49]
probably talk about ggf files in another

[10:39:46 - 10:39:51]
video but but down below here I imagine

[10:39:49 - 10:39:53]
we can interact with it

[10:39:51 - 10:39:56]
programmatically so it is running here

[10:39:53 - 10:40:00]
but if we open this up we can

[10:39:56 - 10:40:02]
see yeah we could specify the URL

[10:40:00 - 10:40:04]
endpoint uh for it so that's kind of

[10:40:02 - 10:40:06]
cool or we could use Curl but now that

[10:40:04 - 10:40:08]
we got it working in Windows I'd be

[10:40:06 - 10:40:10]
interesting to try in in uh Linux as

[10:40:08 - 10:40:12]
that's probably a more common use case

[10:40:10 - 10:40:14]
here I'm not sure how we exited I just

[10:40:12 - 10:40:17]
did command or control C multiple times

[10:40:14 - 10:40:19]
so I'm going to go over here I'm going

[10:40:17 - 10:40:22]
to just take off that .exe on the end of

[10:40:19 - 10:40:24]
it if I'm allowed to I'm not sure how I

[10:40:22 - 10:40:26]
would do that um I'm not seeing

[10:40:24 - 10:40:27]
extensions here so maybe that's

[10:40:26 - 10:40:32]
something I can fix in my settings

[10:40:27 - 10:40:32]
wherever that is so I want to

[10:40:32 - 10:40:35]
see all

[10:40:36 - 10:40:40]
extensions I don't want to hide any

[10:40:38 - 10:40:44]
types there we go so now I can go ahead

[10:40:40 - 10:40:44]
and rename this and take off the

[10:40:45 - 10:40:49]
dotexe yep we're going to just change it

[10:40:47 - 10:40:53]
back into a binary I'm going to open up

[10:40:49 - 10:40:54]
vs code which should have um WSL

[10:40:53 - 10:40:55]
accessible here which we did in a

[10:40:54 - 10:40:58]
separate

[10:40:55 - 10:40:59]
video which video I cannot tell you but

[10:40:58 - 10:41:00]
it's somewhere here we're going to drop

[10:40:59 - 10:41:03]
this down we're going to make our way

[10:41:00 - 10:41:04]
over to WSL we'll give it a moment here

[10:41:03 - 10:41:07]
to

[10:41:04 - 10:41:08]
open great so there should be a way that

[10:41:07 - 10:41:11]
we can access it here because it looks

[10:41:08 - 10:41:14]
like it is going based on local here so

[10:41:11 - 10:41:17]
we go back a couple steps here do we

[10:41:14 - 10:41:20]
have downloads in here we do excellent

[10:41:17 - 10:41:23]
and so I'm going to go ahead and um do

[10:41:20 - 10:41:25]
lsph la so we're looking at to see if

[10:41:23 - 10:41:27]
it's executable it looks like it is I'm

[10:41:25 - 10:41:29]
not 100% certain but if it's not we're

[10:41:27 - 10:41:32]
going to chamod it do U plus X that's

[10:41:29 - 10:41:34]
the usual thing that we do for that and

[10:41:32 - 10:41:35]
I mean it looks the same to me so I

[10:41:34 - 10:41:39]
think that it's executable now I think

[10:41:35 - 10:41:41]
we just do this very

[10:41:39 - 10:41:44]
similarly like

[10:41:41 - 10:41:45]
that okay and so again similar

[10:41:44 - 10:41:46]
experience we can talk to it there I

[10:41:45 - 10:41:48]
don't want to talk to it there what I

[10:41:46 - 10:41:51]
actually want to do is um write some

[10:41:48 - 10:41:53]
code here I think I showed this old Lama

[10:41:51 - 10:41:56]
Stu before I didn't figure out a way to

[10:41:53 - 10:41:59]
uh get this accessible another way still

[10:41:56 - 10:42:01]
I'm going to open up another uh Ubuntu

[10:41:59 - 10:42:02]
WSL here I'm just going to CD back here

[10:42:01 - 10:42:04]
I'm going to make a new directory this

[10:42:02 - 10:42:06]
is going to be called I like how I

[10:42:04 - 10:42:10]
spelled o Lama wrong previous as well

[10:42:06 - 10:42:13]
this is going to be llama file

[10:42:10 - 10:42:16]
Basics and I'm just going to go here and

[10:42:13 - 10:42:19]
I want to interact with that endpoint so

[10:42:16 - 10:42:20]
uh we'll go back back over to this and

[10:42:19 - 10:42:22]
we have a curl but I'm more interested

[10:42:20 - 10:42:26]
in the python code so we'll go grab this

[10:42:22 - 10:42:26]
one here we are using

[10:42:26 - 10:42:33]
um uh llama so I'm not sure like well

[10:42:31 - 10:42:35]
hold on this is llama

[10:42:33 - 10:42:37]
CCP Port 80 if you're already uh

[10:42:35 - 10:42:40]
software development opening I python

[10:42:37 - 10:42:42]
package then you should be able to do it

[10:42:40 - 10:42:44]
okay that's interesting so it works with

[10:42:42 - 10:42:47]
the O open AI interface it's not an open

[10:42:44 - 10:42:48]
AI model but that's interesting that

[10:42:47 - 10:42:49]
that you can utilize that I thought

[10:42:48 - 10:42:51]
you'd have to use hugging face or

[10:42:49 - 10:42:53]
something you probably can use hugging

[10:42:51 - 10:42:56]
face as you probably just point it to an

[10:42:53 - 10:42:58]
end point but let's go back over to here

[10:42:56 - 10:43:01]
into vs

[10:42:58 - 10:43:03]
code and I'm just type in code period to

[10:43:01 - 10:43:05]
open this up I guess it's installing it

[10:43:03 - 10:43:07]
I actually found this out today I was

[10:43:05 - 10:43:08]
working with my friend Tim and I

[10:43:07 - 10:43:10]
actually let this install the way and

[10:43:08 - 10:43:11]
then it actually opened up a new one so

[10:43:10 - 10:43:13]
that was really

[10:43:11 - 10:43:15]
good there we go so now we're in the

[10:43:13 - 10:43:18]
context of this project which is a

[10:43:15 - 10:43:20]
little bit better

[10:43:18 - 10:43:21]
um and so I'm going to make a new file

[10:43:20 - 10:43:23]
here this is going to be called

[10:43:21 - 10:43:25]
app.py I'm just pasting the contents in

[10:43:23 - 10:43:27]
here and for the most part I don't think

[10:43:25 - 10:43:29]
there's really much we have to change I

[10:43:27 - 10:43:31]
don't think we need an API key because

[10:43:29 - 10:43:33]
there's nothing special here it is

[10:43:31 - 10:43:36]
running on Port 880 I'm not sure if it's

[10:43:33 - 10:43:40]
version one I think it's just port

[10:43:36 - 10:43:40]
8080 um it says llama CC

[10:43:41 - 10:43:47]
CPP which I'm not exactly sure about but

[10:43:44 - 10:43:50]
let's go ahead and see if we can uh

[10:43:47 - 10:43:53]
run this I'm going to go ahead and go to

[10:43:50 - 10:43:54]
my terminal actually I kind of prefer if

[10:43:53 - 10:43:57]
this was a notebook it'd be easier to

[10:43:54 - 10:44:00]
work with so it's

[10:43:57 - 10:44:02]
ipynb for now I have that memorized and

[10:44:00 - 10:44:04]
I lost my code which is totally

[10:44:02 - 10:44:06]
fine and I really mucked that up so I'm

[10:44:04 - 10:44:11]
going to go ahead and delete that okay

[10:44:06 - 10:44:11]
I'm going to try this again uh app.

[10:44:11 - 10:44:17]
iynb and we'll add our code

[10:44:15 - 10:44:19]
Block it's a little bit harder because

[10:44:17 - 10:44:21]
I'm uh in a remote desktop so I have to

[10:44:19 - 10:44:22]
click everywhere everywhere I need to go

[10:44:21 - 10:44:25]
here but we'll go ahead and paste that

[10:44:22 - 10:44:27]
in and so here we have this we'll go

[10:44:25 - 10:44:33]
ahead and run

[10:44:27 - 10:44:34]
that it might not know what um open AI

[10:44:33 - 10:44:38]
is is it

[10:44:34 - 10:44:40]
running we save that it's acting kind of

[10:44:38 - 10:44:42]
funny here let's open this

[10:44:40 - 10:44:45]
again is this not code let's try this

[10:44:42 - 10:44:48]
code yeah it's

[10:44:45 - 10:44:49]
code maybe we'll select kernel here oh

[10:44:48 - 10:44:51]
the extensions already even installed

[10:44:49 - 10:44:54]
for this okay so it's going to install

[10:44:51 - 10:44:54]
the Jupiter extensions

[10:44:55 - 10:45:01]
here fair enough first time doing

[10:44:59 - 10:45:03]
it probably would have kept that for

[10:45:01 - 10:45:05]
another video but that's totally okay so

[10:45:03 - 10:45:07]
this is going to install the python

[10:45:05 - 10:45:09]
extension and the jupyter extension and

[10:45:07 - 10:45:11]
so this way it can actually interact

[10:45:09 - 10:45:13]
with python and stuff like that so give

[10:45:11 - 10:45:15]
it a moment to install there we are so

[10:45:13 - 10:45:17]
those are both installed um again going

[10:45:15 - 10:45:20]
to try to select a kernel and we'll go

[10:45:17 - 10:45:24]
ahead and select three 312 I'm going to

[10:45:20 - 10:45:26]
go ahead and hit play and says running

[10:45:24 - 10:45:29]
cells requires IP kernel and pip yeah go

[10:45:26 - 10:45:31]
ahead and install it there is no pip

[10:45:29 - 10:45:34]
installer available for this environment

[10:45:31 - 10:45:36]
okay so it is attempting here I mean

[10:45:34 - 10:45:37]
it's just like whatever the environment

[10:45:36 - 10:45:39]
is so if I go over back to the

[10:45:37 - 10:45:41]
environment it's just because it's such

[10:45:39 - 10:45:45]
a fresh environment like you know we

[10:45:41 - 10:45:47]
have Pip here is PIP does pip

[10:45:45 - 10:45:51]
exist uh is PIP three

[10:45:47 - 10:45:54]
here yeah it's not even aware of any

[10:45:51 - 10:45:54]
environment

[10:45:55 - 10:45:59]
so I'm just trying to decide here do I

[10:45:58 - 10:46:01]
want to get this working now or do I

[10:45:59 - 10:46:03]
want to show it another another video as

[10:46:01 - 10:46:06]
we are supposedly going to set that up

[10:46:03 - 10:46:09]
later um I'm going to leave this

[10:46:06 - 10:46:10]
alone but I'm going to go ahead and re

[10:46:09 - 10:46:11]
just take this file we're going to go

[10:46:10 - 10:46:13]
back the other way so I'm not going to

[10:46:11 - 10:46:16]
set up the notebook right now as I want

[10:46:13 - 10:46:18]
that for another video which you may

[10:46:16 - 10:46:20]
have seen already or you may have not

[10:46:18 - 10:46:22]
seen I'm not sure but we'll go ahead and

[10:46:20 - 10:46:24]
save this and try this again and we'll

[10:46:22 - 10:46:28]
just run it the old fashioned way which

[10:46:24 - 10:46:28]
is totally fine so I'll just say Python

[10:46:29 - 10:46:33]
app.py and it saying doesn't know what

[10:46:31 - 10:46:36]
that is we'll try python python are we

[10:46:33 - 10:46:39]
in

[10:46:36 - 10:46:39]
WSL say

[10:46:39 - 10:46:44]
bash

[10:46:41 - 10:46:47]
python three Python 3 there we go we

[10:46:44 - 10:46:50]
have Python 3 for sure

[10:46:47 - 10:46:52]
sometimes this can be a little bit

[10:46:50 - 10:46:56]
finicky there we go so I'm going to type

[10:46:52 - 10:46:58]
this again so we'll try um Python 3 uh

[10:46:56 - 10:47:00]
app.py and that's understandable it

[10:46:58 - 10:47:01]
doesn't know what that is so can I do

[10:47:00 - 10:47:04]
pip

[10:47:01 - 10:47:07]
install uh open

[10:47:04 - 10:47:08]
AI I'll just do it do this with a three

[10:47:07 - 10:47:10]
so there's no pip so there's I have no

[10:47:08 - 10:47:12]
environment set up and that's kind of a

[10:47:10 - 10:47:15]
an issue so in a separate video what I

[10:47:12 - 10:47:17]
need to do is I need to actually um uh

[10:47:15 - 10:47:18]
show how to set that up so you know what

[10:47:17 - 10:47:20]
I'm not going to worry about this I'm

[10:47:18 - 10:47:22]
confident that this will work let's just

[10:47:20 - 10:47:25]
focus on the curl one I just don't want

[10:47:22 - 10:47:26]
to end up installing cond and all that

[10:47:25 - 10:47:30]
stuff here when I want to leave that for

[10:47:26 - 10:47:32]
a separate video so uh what we'll do is

[10:47:30 - 10:47:35]
again we just want to interact with that

[10:47:32 - 10:47:37]
programmatically so I'm going to go here

[10:47:35 - 10:47:40]
up to the curl

[10:47:37 - 10:47:43]
command 8080 right and so here bear no

[10:47:40 - 10:47:45]
key because I don't think it requires a

[10:47:43 - 10:47:48]
key and so maybe we could try to run

[10:47:45 - 10:47:48]
this one here

[10:47:48 - 10:47:52]
I don't know why this is being shown

[10:47:50 - 10:47:53]
here I guess it's because it's uh yeah I

[10:47:52 - 10:47:54]
don't even know why they're doing that

[10:47:53 - 10:47:57]
there that doesn't make any sense but

[10:47:54 - 10:48:01]
we'll go back over to here

[10:47:57 - 10:48:06]
um and this is running right now in well

[10:48:01 - 10:48:06]
we renamed it right so is Sten still

[10:48:06 - 10:48:12]
running okay so what we'll do we'll go

[10:48:10 - 10:48:13]
to we'll go back we'll go back a couple

[10:48:12 - 10:48:15]
steps

[10:48:13 - 10:48:17]
here because this is in our downloads

[10:48:15 - 10:48:18]
right

[10:48:17 - 10:48:20]
and the first thing I want to do is run

[10:48:18 - 10:48:22]
llama 3.2x I thought we were already

[10:48:20 - 10:48:26]
running it maybe in another window we

[10:48:22 - 10:48:26]
were yeah we were over

[10:48:26 - 10:48:30]
here okay so I'm going to just stop this

[10:48:28 - 10:48:34]
here I don't want it twice okay so I'll

[10:48:30 - 10:48:36]
close this one out and in

[10:48:34 - 10:48:39]
here yeah we're running it right now and

[10:48:36 - 10:48:42]
this is in WSL so in another WSL window

[10:48:39 - 10:48:44]
I I apologize for the mess do we have

[10:48:42 - 10:48:46]
curl we do excellent so I'm going to go

[10:48:44 - 10:48:49]
ahead and paste in the curl command and

[10:48:46 - 10:48:50]
we'll hit enter it says cannot connect

[10:48:49 - 10:48:52]
on Port 880 we'll go back over to here

[10:48:50 - 10:48:55]
this is on Port

[10:48:52 - 10:48:57]
880 so I just need a scratch Pad here

[10:48:55 - 10:48:58]
and we're going to paste in uh this here

[10:48:57 - 10:49:01]
I'm going to carefully look at this this

[10:48:58 - 10:49:04]
says V1 chat completions I'm not sure if

[10:49:01 - 10:49:05]
that's really the end point for it as we

[10:49:04 - 10:49:08]
don't know that kind of looks like the

[10:49:05 - 10:49:10]
open API uh standard way of doing it

[10:49:08 - 10:49:13]
which wouldn't necessarily be

[10:49:10 - 10:49:15]
wrong

[10:49:13 - 10:49:18]
um so I mean nothing looks wrong here

[10:49:15 - 10:49:20]
per se but I'm not sure what llama C CPP

[10:49:18 - 10:49:21]
is I've honestly haven't seen that

[10:49:20 - 10:49:24]
before so I'm going to go here and make

[10:49:21 - 10:49:27]
a new tab maybe that's a very specific

[10:49:24 - 10:49:28]
model oh they're saying llama C CPP so

[10:49:27 - 10:49:32]
they're literally talking about

[10:49:28 - 10:49:33]
inferring from a CPP file okay but we

[10:49:32 - 10:49:37]
are

[10:49:33 - 10:49:40]
using something else which is GG

[10:49:37 - 10:49:41]
up so let me go back over to here yeah

[10:49:40 - 10:49:43]
there should be some way to work make

[10:49:41 - 10:49:45]
this work give me a second I'll be back

[10:49:43 - 10:49:46]
in just a moment okay all right so it's

[10:49:45 - 10:49:48]
still not working I'm thinking maybe

[10:49:46 - 10:49:50]
I'll just copy this

[10:49:48 - 10:49:52]
verbatim and we'll try to give that a go

[10:49:50 - 10:49:54]
as I did take out the authorization but

[10:49:52 - 10:49:55]
maybe we need to actually pass be or no

[10:49:54 - 10:49:57]
key and that's maybe the reason why it's

[10:49:55 - 10:49:59]
failing um as I was trying to do a plane

[10:49:57 - 10:50:01]
curl on it just as Local Host and says

[10:49:59 - 10:50:03]
couldn't connect to the server so go

[10:50:01 - 10:50:07]
ahead and hit enter and now it works

[10:50:03 - 10:50:09]
okay so um hello I mean like it didn't

[10:50:07 - 10:50:11]
airor out per se but this one has the

[10:50:09 - 10:50:12]
bearer token in it as well so why

[10:50:11 - 10:50:14]
doesn't that one work we'll go ahead and

[10:50:12 - 10:50:17]
paste this in

[10:50:14 - 10:50:19]
again um that one doesn't have the the

[10:50:17 - 10:50:20]
closing parentheses though here I wonder

[10:50:19 - 10:50:23]
if that's maybe the problem here let's

[10:50:20 - 10:50:26]
go ahead and try this and hit

[10:50:23 - 10:50:28]
enter um yeah and I don't know they just

[10:50:26 - 10:50:31]
didn't give us good code I

[10:50:28 - 10:50:33]
guess yeah I I don't I don't like this

[10:50:31 - 10:50:34]
um it seems like there's a lot of work

[10:50:33 - 10:50:35]
we might be able to get it

[10:50:34 - 10:50:37]
programmatically to work but just

[10:50:35 - 10:50:38]
because um I don't have the environment

[10:50:37 - 10:50:40]
set up here and I don't want to do that

[10:50:38 - 10:50:42]
video I guess we'll just call it quits

[10:50:40 - 10:50:44]
here but yeah it's interesting to see

[10:50:42 - 10:50:45]
that you can run this maybe when we get

[10:50:44 - 10:50:47]
a little bit more experience with llama

[10:50:45 - 10:50:49]
C uh CPP this will be a lot easier for

[10:50:47 - 10:50:51]
us to do or we have this environment it'

[10:50:49 - 10:50:53]
be less of an issue but you know we got

[10:50:51 - 10:50:55]
it running so we can clearly work with

[10:50:53 - 10:50:57]
it but um programmatically if you really

[10:50:55 - 10:50:59]
want to work with this way then you'll

[10:50:57 - 10:51:02]
have to do more work so why would you

[10:50:59 - 10:51:04]
want this um well let's say you want to

[10:51:02 - 10:51:06]
bundle app and you just need the binary

[10:51:04 - 10:51:07]
you want to drop it in there obviously

[10:51:06 - 10:51:11]
that is a really easy way to do it I

[10:51:07 - 10:51:13]
personally think it's not hard to use um

[10:51:11 - 10:51:16]
uh servers like that actually serve um

[10:51:13 - 10:51:17]
files so I suppose you could do this if

[10:51:16 - 10:51:21]
you don't want to include any additional

[10:51:17 - 10:51:22]
code but I feel like you know often if

[10:51:21 - 10:51:24]
you are serving a model you're working

[10:51:22 - 10:51:26]
with python anyway as a python app but I

[10:51:24 - 10:51:29]
guess if you had one binary that was

[10:51:26 - 10:51:32]
your um your uh like your llama file

[10:51:29 - 10:51:34]
here that runs your actual model and you

[10:51:32 - 10:51:37]
had another binary and you just wanted

[10:51:34 - 10:51:38]
to drop on a machine and you had the two

[10:51:37 - 10:51:41]
then I suppose that could be uh great

[10:51:38 - 10:51:42]
for local local inference but uh yeah I

[10:51:41 - 10:51:46]
mean that's it and I'll see you in the

[10:51:42 - 10:51:46]
next one okay ciao

[10:51:47 - 10:51:50]
[Music]

[10:51:48 - 10:51:51]
let's take a look here at Lang chain

[10:51:50 - 10:51:54]
this is an open source framework to

[10:51:51 - 10:51:56]
rapidly prototype agents or LM workloads

[10:51:54 - 10:51:58]
and here is an example of uh using

[10:51:56 - 10:51:59]
langin here on the left hand side

[10:51:58 - 10:52:01]
features include prompt templates

[10:51:59 - 10:52:03]
messages output parsers document loaders

[10:52:01 - 10:52:05]
text Splitters adapters of various

[10:52:03 - 10:52:07]
Vector stores adapters of various

[10:52:05 - 10:52:09]
embeddings uh various retrievers to

[10:52:07 - 10:52:12]
implement rag indexing tool use support

[10:52:09 - 10:52:17]
to work with multimodal

[10:52:12 - 10:52:19]
models um uh agent workflows and example

[10:52:17 - 10:52:21]
selector so it has a lot of

[10:52:19 - 10:52:23]
functionality built in so that you don't

[10:52:21 - 10:52:26]
have to code these things yourself you

[10:52:23 - 10:52:28]
can just use the SDK and start building

[10:52:26 - 10:52:30]
things and connect to many different LMS

[10:52:28 - 10:52:32]
and things like that uh this was very

[10:52:30 - 10:52:34]
popular for quite a while um I don't

[10:52:32 - 10:52:36]
personally recommend Lang chain because

[10:52:34 - 10:52:38]
um I feel that the API breaks quite a

[10:52:36 - 10:52:40]
bit and so a lot of the documentation

[10:52:38 - 10:52:41]
does not match when you want to bring

[10:52:40 - 10:52:43]
this into production um I would not

[10:52:41 - 10:52:46]
recommend this for production use cases

[10:52:43 - 10:52:48]
because um you're basically limited to a

[10:52:46 - 10:52:49]
single server um and you have all these

[10:52:48 - 10:52:51]
moving parts and you really need to

[10:52:49 - 10:52:55]
break them up into containers or things

[10:52:51 - 10:52:57]
like that however um Lang chain um while

[10:52:55 - 10:52:59]
I say it's not well suited for

[10:52:57 - 10:53:01]
production use cases the company has

[10:52:59 - 10:53:04]
built a suite of tools so that if you

[10:53:01 - 10:53:06]
want to utilize Lang chain in production

[10:53:04 - 10:53:08]
you can buy into their system the Lang

[10:53:06 - 10:53:10]
the Lang graph platform they also have

[10:53:08 - 10:53:12]
this other Library called Lang graph I

[10:53:10 - 10:53:15]
don't know much about it but my friend

[10:53:12 - 10:53:16]
George who knows a lot about building

[10:53:15 - 10:53:19]
out agents was saying that this is a

[10:53:16 - 10:53:20]
more lowlevel one and so it might be a

[10:53:19 - 10:53:22]
better version of Lang chain I don't

[10:53:20 - 10:53:25]
know maybe he'll show us how to utilize

[10:53:22 - 10:53:27]
it at some point um so you could ship an

[10:53:25 - 10:53:29]
LM workload as a minimal viable product

[10:53:27 - 10:53:31]
with Lang chain but you would probably

[10:53:29 - 10:53:35]
have to rebuild it uh utilizing multiple

[10:53:31 - 10:53:36]
containers something utilizing Opa Lang

[10:53:35 - 10:53:38]
chain was one of the earliest geni

[10:53:36 - 10:53:41]
Frameworks that made it easy to swap out

[10:53:38 - 10:53:43]
LMS with unified API when anms had small

[10:53:41 - 10:53:45]
context Windows Lang chain worked around

[10:53:43 - 10:53:46]
this limitation by providing multiple

[10:53:45 - 10:53:48]
chaining strategies like summarized

[10:53:46 - 10:53:49]
and this is what I remember Lang chain

[10:53:48 - 10:53:52]
for and that's why it was called Lang

[10:53:49 - 10:53:55]
chain um there is a competitor called

[10:53:52 - 10:53:58]
llama index I do prefer llama index uh

[10:53:55 - 10:54:00]
but to be honest I uh rather not use

[10:53:58 - 10:54:01]
either and just write the code uh by

[10:54:00 - 10:54:03]
hand and I think a lot of people are

[10:54:01 - 10:54:05]
going that direction as they're finding

[10:54:03 - 10:54:07]
these things easier to use but they are

[10:54:05 - 10:54:09]
still around they are great for learning

[10:54:07 - 10:54:10]
uh so if you feel comfortable utilizing

[10:54:09 - 10:54:14]
them go ahead and use them

[10:54:10 - 10:54:16]
[Music]

[10:54:14 - 10:54:18]
okay all right let's take a look at

[10:54:16 - 10:54:20]
llama Index this is an open source

[10:54:18 - 10:54:23]
framework to rapidly prototype agents or

[10:54:20 - 10:54:26]
llm workloads so here's an example of uh

[10:54:23 - 10:54:28]
some llama index code llama index has

[10:54:26 - 10:54:30]
wider support for data connectors and

[10:54:28 - 10:54:32]
advanced rag techniques and this is one

[10:54:30 - 10:54:34]
reason why you might want to utilize it

[10:54:32 - 10:54:37]
over Lang chain but obviously these two

[10:54:34 - 10:54:38]
things are coming close to parity so it

[10:54:37 - 10:54:40]
really doesn't matter which one you

[10:54:38 - 10:54:42]
utilize I don't really recommend Lang

[10:54:40 - 10:54:45]
chain or Lama index as I feel that it's

[10:54:42 - 10:54:47]
an additional abstraction um that uh

[10:54:45 - 10:54:49]
does not not always pay off in the long

[10:54:47 - 10:54:51]
term for it but I do want to mention

[10:54:49 - 10:54:53]
llama index and L chain because you

[10:54:51 - 10:54:55]
might have interest in utilizing this um

[10:54:53 - 10:54:57]
because it seems like this is an opinion

[10:54:55 - 10:54:59]
framework to start building out and

[10:54:57 - 10:55:02]
working with multiple llms with a single

[10:54:59 - 10:55:04]
API but it doesn't uh necessarily

[10:55:02 - 10:55:06]
deliver on the promise at least not

[10:55:04 - 10:55:07]
right now but it has Concepts like data

[10:55:06 - 10:55:10]
connectors so you can easily connect to

[10:55:07 - 10:55:12]
multiple data sources uh data indexes

[10:55:10 - 10:55:15]
engines agents observability evaluations

[10:55:12 - 10:55:16]
workflows LL index has its own platform

[10:55:15 - 10:55:18]
called llama Cloud for Enterprise

[10:55:16 - 10:55:21]
production similar to Lang chain having

[10:55:18 - 10:55:24]
their own platform offering uh consider

[10:55:21 - 10:55:25]
just uh it just like Lang chain the L

[10:55:24 - 10:55:27]
index isn't designed for production use

[10:55:25 - 10:55:28]
case that's something I say about Lang

[10:55:27 - 10:55:30]
chain is that I don't consider it that

[10:55:28 - 10:55:31]
it's something you want to put on a

[10:55:30 - 10:55:33]
server in scale but if there is an

[10:55:31 - 10:55:36]
Enterprise offering from the actual

[10:55:33 - 10:55:37]
creators then they might have some way

[10:55:36 - 10:55:40]
to work with it but then you're buying

[10:55:37 - 10:55:41]
into their mode so I'm not 100% certain

[10:55:40 - 10:55:44]
if I recommend these tools but if you

[10:55:41 - 10:55:46]
are learning um to work with LMS and you

[10:55:44 - 10:55:48]
find this easy this is something

[10:55:46 - 10:55:51]
something that you can utilize sometimes

[10:55:48 - 10:55:54]
they will come with predefined agents um

[10:55:51 - 10:55:57]
and so you can see how to work with

[10:55:54 - 10:55:59]
agentic workflow with u more advanced um

[10:55:57 - 10:56:01]
uh workflow techniques and then figure

[10:55:59 - 10:56:02]
out how to manually convert that over

[10:56:01 - 10:56:06]
and build that yourself

[10:56:02 - 10:56:08]
[Music]

[10:56:06 - 10:56:11]
okay hey this is Andrew Brown we're

[10:56:08 - 10:56:14]
taking a look at llama CPP so llama CPP

[10:56:11 - 10:56:15]
is an inference server for llms llama

[10:56:14 - 10:56:17]
CPP implements the underlying

[10:56:15 - 10:56:20]
architecture of the The Meta llas

[10:56:17 - 10:56:22]
architecture within CC and C++ intended

[10:56:20 - 10:56:26]
to allow improved performance running

[10:56:22 - 10:56:28]
models on CPUs the main goal of llama

[10:56:26 - 10:56:30]
CPP is to enable LM inference with

[10:56:28 - 10:56:32]
minimal setup and save the-art

[10:56:30 - 10:56:34]
performance on a wide range of Hardware

[10:56:32 - 10:56:38]
locally and in the cloud so here's an

[10:56:34 - 10:56:41]
example of us utilizing um llama

[10:56:38 - 10:56:43]
CPP uh with Ruby as they do have

[10:56:41 - 10:56:45]
basically bindings for almost every

[10:56:43 - 10:56:47]
possible language which is really nice

[10:56:45 - 10:56:48]
uh they have a C tool which is also

[10:56:47 - 10:56:50]
really nice they have a lightweight

[10:56:48 - 10:56:53]
server which is also really nice lots of

[10:56:50 - 10:56:55]
Integrations with UI tools and llama cpb

[10:56:53 - 10:56:58]
Works only with ggf format files for

[10:56:55 - 10:57:02]
model weights um so this thing is really

[10:56:58 - 10:57:04]
again intended uh for um uh just working

[10:57:02 - 10:57:06]
on a broad amount of stuff working with

[10:57:04 - 10:57:08]
very specific open source models I would

[10:57:06 - 10:57:09]
love to show you how this works um I've

[10:57:08 - 10:57:12]
been having a lot of trouble with my

[10:57:09 - 10:57:14]
local machine but I'm trying to make a

[10:57:12 - 10:57:16]
uh a video for you because llama CPP

[10:57:14 - 10:57:18]
comes up a time and time time and again

[10:57:16 - 10:57:19]
I would really like to Showcase how to

[10:57:18 - 10:57:23]
utilize that

[10:57:19 - 10:57:25]
[Music]

[10:57:23 - 10:57:27]
okay hey this is Andre Brown this video

[10:57:25 - 10:57:28]
I want to see if we can Implement llama

[10:57:27 - 10:57:30]
CPP I'm going to just tell you I've

[10:57:28 - 10:57:32]
tried this video like nine times and I

[10:57:30 - 10:57:33]
keep running into issues just because

[10:57:32 - 10:57:35]
I'm having issues with my local

[10:57:33 - 10:57:38]
development lightning AI is giving me

[10:57:35 - 10:57:40]
permission issues and so now I'm tempted

[10:57:38 - 10:57:41]
to do something that seems very bizarre

[10:57:40 - 10:57:45]
for this particular lab but it might

[10:57:41 - 10:57:46]
work I'm going to use gpod so um I'm

[10:57:45 - 10:57:48]
going to go over here and launch up git

[10:57:46 - 10:57:50]
pod because I know it has Homebrew and

[10:57:48 - 10:57:52]
that has G me gives me a high chance to

[10:57:50 - 10:57:55]
get this installed and working um so I'm

[10:57:52 - 10:57:57]
launching up git pod here um and I'm

[10:57:55 - 10:58:03]
actually going to specifically go to the

[10:57:57 - 10:58:04]
hugging phas ggf uh G ggu llama CPP

[10:58:03 - 10:58:06]
because here they have instructions that

[10:58:04 - 10:58:08]
I feel that are most likely to work it

[10:58:06 - 10:58:11]
says you can install the LA CP through

[10:58:08 - 10:58:14]
Brew through Mac and Linux um and that's

[10:58:11 - 10:58:16]
exactly what we're going to do so here I

[10:58:14 - 10:58:18]
have G pod launched up I'm I'm going to

[10:58:16 - 10:58:20]
go ahead and install it via brew and

[10:58:18 - 10:58:24]
hopefully it just

[10:58:20 - 10:58:24]
works so we go ahead and do

[10:58:24 - 10:58:28]
this I should have been able to do this

[10:58:26 - 10:58:30]
on my uh Intel machine but I've been

[10:58:28 - 10:58:31]
running it for a very long time and it's

[10:58:30 - 10:58:35]
a development kit it's not a proper

[10:58:31 - 10:58:37]
computer and so I possibly um have given

[10:58:35 - 10:58:39]
it some trouble by not letting it be off

[10:58:37 - 10:58:41]
for a bit and cool down but anyway so

[10:58:39 - 10:58:43]
this is going to go ahead and install

[10:58:41 - 10:58:44]
llama

[10:58:43 - 10:58:47]
CPP apparently you can build it from

[10:58:44 - 10:58:49]
source which we're not going to do here

[10:58:47 - 10:58:52]
today this is once installed you should

[10:58:49 - 10:58:53]
be able to use the the CLI llama CLI

[10:58:52 - 10:58:55]
llama

[10:58:53 - 10:58:58]
server so we give that a moment to

[10:58:55 - 10:59:00]
install okay all right so it should be

[10:58:58 - 10:59:05]
installed now let's go type in llama CLI

[10:59:00 - 10:59:05]
and see if we have it um here it

[10:59:06 - 10:59:09]
says failed to open a file no such file

[10:59:08 - 10:59:11]
directory that's because we don't have

[10:59:09 - 10:59:15]
any files yet so it clearly is trying to

[10:59:11 - 10:59:16]
run something but we're going to need to

[10:59:15 - 10:59:18]
actually have something here and this

[10:59:16 - 10:59:22]
one in particular is specifying one from

[10:59:18 - 10:59:25]
hugging face so maybe we can grab this

[10:59:22 - 10:59:26]
one using llama 3 8 billion parameter I

[10:59:25 - 10:59:28]
don't really want an 8 billion parameter

[10:59:26 - 10:59:30]
one but the fact that it just has it

[10:59:28 - 10:59:32]
right here might make it really easy you

[10:59:30 - 10:59:34]
can move cnv to run the CI in chat

[10:59:32 - 10:59:36]
completion mode uh you know I don't

[10:59:34 - 10:59:38]
necessarily need that but let's go ahead

[10:59:36 - 10:59:39]
and run this and see if it works so go

[10:59:38 - 10:59:44]
ahead and hit

[10:59:39 - 10:59:48]
enter and here we're getting uh command

[10:59:44 - 10:59:49]
not found HP high repo so or HF repo so

[10:59:48 - 10:59:52]
it's saying that flag doesn't exist

[10:59:49 - 10:59:54]
which is fine I'm going to go and type

[10:59:52 - 10:59:56]
in llama CI hyphen Hy help and see what

[10:59:54 - 10:59:56]
we have as our

[10:59:57 - 11:00:02]
flags but I need some way of getting the

[10:59:59 - 11:00:05]
model down here it looks like it's now

[11:00:02 - 11:00:07]
hrf so let's go ahead and hit up here

[11:00:05 - 11:00:09]
for a second and we'll go back over to

[11:00:07 - 11:00:10]
this apparently we can hit up on it

[11:00:09 - 11:00:13]
which is kind of annoying I'm going to

[11:00:10 - 11:00:14]
just go make a new file here just a

[11:00:13 - 11:00:17]
plain text file so we have a little

[11:00:14 - 11:00:18]
scratch Pad I'm going to grab this again

[11:00:17 - 11:00:20]
I'm going to paste it in here it looks

[11:00:18 - 11:00:22]
like the syntax is a little bit

[11:00:20 - 11:00:26]
different this is going to be

[11:00:22 - 11:00:26]
hrf what about the

[11:00:29 - 11:00:37]
file and hugging face files HR

[11:00:33 - 11:00:39]
FF so that is fine and so we will go

[11:00:37 - 11:00:41]
down to the ground here I will type in

[11:00:39 - 11:00:42]
clear and we'll go ahead and see if we

[11:00:41 - 11:00:44]
can run

[11:00:42 - 11:00:48]
this

[11:00:44 - 11:00:48]
enter instead so now we

[11:00:51 - 11:00:58]
have llama back in it load the model

[11:00:53 - 11:00:58]
apply the low adapter no such file or

[11:00:58 - 11:01:03]
directory unable to find the command

[11:01:01 - 11:01:05]
well this has double flag so maybe it's

[11:01:03 - 11:01:08]
just a single one that's probably what

[11:01:05 - 11:01:10]
it would be let's go ahead and try

[11:01:08 - 11:01:12]
this okay we'll go and check the

[11:01:10 - 11:01:16]
permissions again or the um instructions

[11:01:12 - 11:01:16]
here again this is kind of a headache

[11:01:27 - 11:01:34]
yeah it's a hyphen flag and the full

[11:01:30 - 11:01:35]
Flags go there so maybe the problem is

[11:01:34 - 11:01:37]
maybe these flags are fine the problem

[11:01:35 - 11:01:40]
is is the fact that this

[11:01:37 - 11:01:43]
is not like

[11:01:40 - 11:01:47]
that okay so we'll give that a go maybe

[11:01:43 - 11:01:47]
that was their problem this entire time

[11:01:47 - 11:01:52]
enter there we go so yeah the code

[11:01:50 - 11:01:55]
copying from here is a bit messed up

[11:01:52 - 11:01:57]
they should have um had a a a backlash

[11:01:55 - 11:01:58]
there so it's a problem with their code

[11:01:57 - 11:01:59]
and so here it looks like it's

[11:01:58 - 11:02:03]
downloading that model where it's

[11:01:59 - 11:02:04]
downloading I'm not sure maybe in place

[11:02:03 - 11:02:05]
I'm I'm not certain but it is

[11:02:04 - 11:02:07]
downloading the model we're just going

[11:02:05 - 11:02:09]
to wait for that to happen okay all

[11:02:07 - 11:02:11]
right so while it downloaded the model

[11:02:09 - 11:02:13]
it now Ransom code it looks like so

[11:02:11 - 11:02:17]
running interactive mode you are a

[11:02:13 - 11:02:20]
helpful assistant um so I say

[11:02:17 - 11:02:22]
hello now this model in particular is

[11:02:20 - 11:02:25]
kind of large for um this computer at

[11:02:22 - 11:02:27]
least I think it is here

[11:02:25 - 11:02:28]
says oh there we go there we go and so

[11:02:27 - 11:02:30]
it is

[11:02:28 - 11:02:34]
working I would have just rather ran a

[11:02:30 - 11:02:37]
smaller model but um I'm not exactly

[11:02:34 - 11:02:39]
sure where we could have found a smaller

[11:02:37 - 11:02:43]
one here because this is this one in

[11:02:39 - 11:02:43]
particular and so I

[11:02:44 - 11:02:48]
wonder is there like a one billion one

[11:02:47 - 11:02:50]
billion parameter one because that's

[11:02:48 - 11:02:52]
what I would really really prefer yeah

[11:02:50 - 11:02:53]
so this one seems a lot more reasonable

[11:02:52 - 11:02:56]
right this one

[11:02:53 - 11:02:58]
here um and it doesn't look like we have

[11:02:56 - 11:02:59]
any special requirements to grab this

[11:02:58 - 11:03:01]
one so maybe that's what I'll do here

[11:02:59 - 11:03:03]
I'm going to tweak this because this one

[11:03:01 - 11:03:05]
was kind of crazy I'm just going to stop

[11:03:03 - 11:03:06]
it it did work but I want something

[11:03:05 - 11:03:07]
that's a little bit performant you know

[11:03:06 - 11:03:09]
what I mean and these 1 billion

[11:03:07 - 11:03:13]
parameter ones are really good at that

[11:03:09 - 11:03:17]
so I'm going to go ahead and replace it

[11:03:13 - 11:03:20]
as such and then in here

[11:03:17 - 11:03:22]
we'll go over to files and versions and

[11:03:20 - 11:03:24]
so we have a few of them and so there's

[11:03:22 - 11:03:26]
different versions of this being

[11:03:24 - 11:03:28]
quantize I'll just take the first one I

[11:03:26 - 11:03:30]
really don't care how well it performs I

[11:03:28 - 11:03:32]
just want to have it work and download

[11:03:30 - 11:03:34]
very quickly and then know that we can

[11:03:32 - 11:03:35]
just quickly swap these out and get

[11:03:34 - 11:03:37]
something that works so I'm going to go

[11:03:35 - 11:03:38]
ahead and copy this and then we will

[11:03:37 - 11:03:39]
paste the in we'll hit enter it's

[11:03:38 - 11:03:41]
obviously going to have to download the

[11:03:39 - 11:03:44]
model again but this one should be way

[11:03:41 - 11:03:46]
less painful um as that last one took

[11:03:44 - 11:03:48]
forever I'm not sure how long large that

[11:03:46 - 11:03:50]
file is let's go back and take a look

[11:03:48 - 11:03:52]
this one's 733 megabytes I have no idea

[11:03:50 - 11:03:54]
how how large the other one is but this

[11:03:52 - 11:03:58]
one's almost already done downloading

[11:03:54 - 11:03:58]
here so we'll give it just a

[11:04:02 - 11:04:08]
moment cool we'll say

[11:04:05 - 11:04:11]
hello and here you can see it's now

[11:04:08 - 11:04:14]
more what are you up

[11:04:11 - 11:04:16]
to and we're just being kind of silly

[11:04:14 - 11:04:18]
here so we're not really having a

[11:04:16 - 11:04:21]
meaningful conversation but that's one

[11:04:18 - 11:04:23]
way we can work with um that I'm gonna

[11:04:21 - 11:04:25]
make a new folder here we'll just say

[11:04:23 - 11:04:27]
llama CPP I didn't even think that this

[11:04:25 - 11:04:28]
was going to work but this actually

[11:04:27 - 11:04:30]
worked so I'm really surprised I'm going

[11:04:28 - 11:04:34]
to go here just make a readme.md

[11:04:30 - 11:04:37]
and so if you want to do

[11:04:34 - 11:04:40]
this you will have this line as

[11:04:37 - 11:04:42]
well so you don't have to look for it

[11:04:40 - 11:04:44]
and I'm just going to go ahead and

[11:04:42 - 11:04:46]
grab this link here so you can see where

[11:04:44 - 11:04:48]
this is as well um so now the question

[11:04:46 - 11:04:50]
is could we work with this

[11:04:48 - 11:04:51]
programmatically right so I'm going to

[11:04:50 - 11:04:56]
go ahead and try this again and this

[11:04:51 - 11:04:56]
will be uh basic.

[11:04:56 - 11:05:02]
Pi yeah that's fine we'll just do it

[11:04:58 - 11:05:05]
this way and so what I want to

[11:05:02 - 11:05:08]
do let's go back over to

[11:05:05 - 11:05:10]
here and they have bindings we'll work

[11:05:08 - 11:05:12]
with the python one I just want my life

[11:05:10 - 11:05:14]
to be easy so we're going to do

[11:05:12 - 11:05:15]
something real simple I'll grab this

[11:05:14 - 11:05:18]
we'll go over to here we'll make make a

[11:05:15 - 11:05:18]
requirements.txt

[11:05:19 - 11:05:25]
and we'll paste this in here and I'm

[11:05:22 - 11:05:29]
going to go ahead and CD into llama CPP

[11:05:25 - 11:05:31]
and we'll do pip install hyphen R

[11:05:29 - 11:05:33]
requirements.txt and so we'll go ahead

[11:05:31 - 11:05:33]
and install

[11:05:35 - 11:05:41]
that and so that will be installing um

[11:05:38 - 11:05:41]
we'll need a little bit of

[11:05:41 - 11:05:46]
code so they should have an example so

[11:05:44 - 11:05:47]
here's an example of one

[11:05:46 - 11:05:49]
we'll grab it I'm not sure how this is

[11:05:47 - 11:05:51]
going to work because I'm not sure where

[11:05:49 - 11:05:54]
the model has downloaded to right so

[11:05:51 - 11:05:56]
here we have model path but I wonder if

[11:05:54 - 11:05:58]
we could specify hugging face that'd be

[11:05:56 - 11:06:00]
really cool if we could do that let's go

[11:05:58 - 11:06:05]
look at the Llama class in

[11:06:00 - 11:06:05]
here and what I'm wondering

[11:06:09 - 11:06:13]
is where that could

[11:06:13 - 11:06:18]
be are these all the parameters I'm not

[11:06:15 - 11:06:19]
sure if I type in hugging phase will we

[11:06:18 - 11:06:21]
get hugging phase in here we do get

[11:06:19 - 11:06:24]
hugging

[11:06:21 - 11:06:24]
phase

[11:06:28 - 11:06:34]
okay well anyway I know that the model

[11:06:31 - 11:06:34]
is

[11:06:34 - 11:06:40]
somewhere say where does hugging Face

[11:06:37 - 11:06:42]
store models when you download

[11:06:40 - 11:06:44]
them because that'll help us out there's

[11:06:42 - 11:06:46]
the do cach folder okay you got to help

[11:06:44 - 11:06:50]
me a little bit more than that

[11:06:46 - 11:06:54]
that okay so for slash hugging face

[11:06:50 - 11:06:54]
Hub let's see if that even

[11:06:55 - 11:06:58]
exists

[11:07:01 - 11:07:04]
LS there is a

[11:07:04 - 11:07:08]
cache but there's oh there llama CPP

[11:07:07 - 11:07:11]
here we go llama

[11:07:08 - 11:07:13]
CPP and I want to do LS here see what we

[11:07:11 - 11:07:16]
have and so it's actually storing them

[11:07:13 - 11:07:20]
over here so that's nice I going to go

[11:07:16 - 11:07:24]
over to here and we'll do

[11:07:20 - 11:07:28]
this this assumes you've used

[11:07:24 - 11:07:30]
llama CLI and downloaded prior because

[11:07:28 - 11:07:31]
we that's how they got here right if we

[11:07:30 - 11:07:33]
don't do that that's not going to work

[11:07:31 - 11:07:35]
and so we do have some models downloaded

[11:07:33 - 11:07:37]
here I want to use the smaller model

[11:07:35 - 11:07:40]
which is this one so I'm going go ahead

[11:07:37 - 11:07:40]
and grab that

[11:07:41 - 11:07:46]
there

[11:07:44 - 11:07:48]
okay uh um and that looks fine I'm not

[11:07:46 - 11:07:49]
sure if those parameters will work with

[11:07:48 - 11:07:51]
it but I guess we'll find out here in

[11:07:49 - 11:07:52]
just a moment so I'm going to go ahead

[11:07:51 - 11:07:55]
and do I think we already did a pip

[11:07:52 - 11:07:58]
install right we did the PIP

[11:07:55 - 11:07:59]
install yes and I believe we saved the

[11:07:58 - 11:08:02]
file right I'm going to do it again just

[11:07:59 - 11:08:05]
in case it that works okay we'll do

[11:08:02 - 11:08:09]
python basic. we'll see what happens

[11:08:05 - 11:08:13]
here and it's saying model path does not

[11:08:09 - 11:08:16]
exist sure it does of course it does so

[11:08:13 - 11:08:16]
maybe what we'll do

[11:08:20 - 11:08:24]
gu it

[11:08:21 - 11:08:25]
does we'll do PWD here and we'll give it

[11:08:24 - 11:08:27]
the full

[11:08:25 - 11:08:30]
path that might make our life a little

[11:08:27 - 11:08:30]
bit easier

[11:08:31 - 11:08:36]
here okay because maybe I can't handle

[11:08:33 - 11:08:40]
the uh that that Tila there and so I'm

[11:08:36 - 11:08:40]
going to go back into uh

[11:08:41 - 11:08:45]
workspaces LS

[11:08:46 - 11:08:49]
sorry

[11:08:47 - 11:08:52]
workspace J

[11:08:49 - 11:08:54]
Essentials llama

[11:08:52 - 11:08:57]
CPP and we'll try this again Python

[11:08:54 - 11:09:00]
basic. py and so now it's running the

[11:08:57 - 11:09:00]
model looks like it's

[11:09:00 - 11:09:04]
working and it's outputed back its

[11:09:03 - 11:09:06]
result here I'm not sure if we get all

[11:09:04 - 11:09:08]
this other stuff maybe there's a way oh

[11:09:06 - 11:09:09]
maybe we say um Echo The Prompt back

[11:09:08 - 11:09:10]
into the output I mean that's what we

[11:09:09 - 11:09:13]
wanted to do I'm not sure what's going

[11:09:10 - 11:09:17]
on with all this other stuff but it does

[11:09:13 - 11:09:17]
come back with this here

[11:09:18 - 11:09:23]
I mean I guess that's all the output

[11:09:21 - 11:09:26]
[Music]

[11:09:23 - 11:09:31]
right but it is very

[11:09:26 - 11:09:31]
verbose llama CPP verbose

[11:09:34 - 11:09:39]
off um Ros Falls

[11:09:39 - 11:09:42]
maybe and that might be a little bit

[11:09:41 - 11:09:46]
easier for us to work with let's see if

[11:09:42 - 11:09:48]
that works there we go

[11:09:46 - 11:09:48]
we'll run it

[11:09:53 - 11:09:56]
again so it's less for B which is nice

[11:09:55 - 11:09:59]
and so there's our implementation with

[11:09:56 - 11:10:00]
llama CPP obviously there's a lot of

[11:09:59 - 11:10:02]
Integrations and other stuff around that

[11:10:00 - 11:10:07]
there the hardest part is just getting

[11:10:02 - 11:10:08]
to those GT ggf files um I'm going again

[11:10:07 - 11:10:10]
I told you this is like my ninth attempt

[11:10:08 - 11:10:11]
or something trying to get this to work

[11:10:10 - 11:10:13]
and this time it worked fine and we used

[11:10:11 - 11:10:15]
git pod of all things like I love git

[11:10:13 - 11:10:18]
pod but like I wanted to use use my

[11:10:15 - 11:10:20]
Intel machine or lightning AI or

[11:10:18 - 11:10:22]
something else but you know sometimes

[11:10:20 - 11:10:24]
the easiest thing is to use G pod so

[11:10:22 - 11:10:26]
that's fine we'll go ahead here and just

[11:10:24 - 11:10:28]
say llama

[11:10:26 - 11:10:30]
ccpb and I'm least glad that I got to

[11:10:28 - 11:10:32]
show it to you because this thing comes

[11:10:30 - 11:10:33]
up again and again and again so I really

[11:10:32 - 11:10:35]
wanted to show you how to use it but

[11:10:33 - 11:10:38]
there you go

[11:10:35 - 11:10:41]
[Music]

[11:10:38 - 11:10:43]
ciao before we can talk about bitnet CPP

[11:10:41 - 11:10:45]
we need to talk about what is one bit

[11:10:43 - 11:10:48]
llm so one bit llms represents the most

[11:10:45 - 11:10:49]
extreme for of quantization using a

[11:10:48 - 11:10:51]
single bit of Z or one for each

[11:10:49 - 11:10:53]
parameter uh we learn about quantization

[11:10:51 - 11:10:55]
in another video but the idea is that

[11:10:53 - 11:10:58]
quantization is we're taking the model

[11:10:55 - 11:10:59]
weights uh and its activator functions

[11:10:58 - 11:11:01]
and you are taking it from something

[11:10:59 - 11:11:03]
that is more High precision and moving

[11:11:01 - 11:11:06]
it to a lower Precision value so if

[11:11:03 - 11:11:10]
something was represented as an F FP 32

[11:11:06 - 11:11:12]
uh so uh a 32 floating Point U value

[11:11:10 - 11:11:14]
then here we're literally boiling down

[11:11:12 - 11:11:15]
to the smallest value which is uh

[11:11:14 - 11:11:17]
possible which is z and one one

[11:11:15 - 11:11:19]
obviously this would greatly reduce the

[11:11:17 - 11:11:21]
model size and computational needs uh

[11:11:19 - 11:11:24]
and so there is a uh a framework out

[11:11:21 - 11:11:25]
there called bitnet CPP which is made by

[11:11:24 - 11:11:29]
Microsoft that's why I'm calling it

[11:11:25 - 11:11:30]
Microsoft's bit net CPP um and the idea

[11:11:29 - 11:11:34]
here is that if you compare this to

[11:11:30 - 11:11:36]
something like llama uh llama CPP which

[11:11:34 - 11:11:39]
is already optimized using C and C++ you

[11:11:36 - 11:11:43]
can see you have huge huge gains of like

[11:11:39 - 11:11:46]
55 to 70% um uh there depending on the

[11:11:43 - 11:11:47]
model that you are utilizing um however

[11:11:46 - 11:11:49]
as great as this sounds there is a

[11:11:47 - 11:11:51]
limitation of types of models that we

[11:11:49 - 11:11:57]
can utilize with this so there is like

[11:11:51 - 11:11:58]
bitnet B1 llama 3B uh uh one uh 1.5 uh I

[11:11:57 - 11:11:59]
don't know whatever the tokens there so

[11:11:58 - 11:12:01]
the Llama one would be the most

[11:11:59 - 11:12:03]
interesting to try out and then they

[11:12:01 - 11:12:05]
there's the Falcon 3 family um I've not

[11:12:03 - 11:12:07]
got to play with this uh quite uh much

[11:12:05 - 11:12:09]
but I would love to and so hopefully uh

[11:12:07 - 11:12:14]
this video will follow with a lab if I

[11:12:09 - 11:12:14]
found time to figure it out

[11:12:14 - 11:12:19]
[Music]

[11:12:16 - 11:12:21]
so GG UF and gml are file formats used

[11:12:19 - 11:12:25]
for storing models for inference often

[11:12:21 - 11:12:28]
models like GPT uh ggf is the successor

[11:12:25 - 11:12:30]
of the gml format so you'll often see

[11:12:28 - 11:12:32]
ggf we're still just going to mention

[11:12:30 - 11:12:34]
gml just because they're basically the

[11:12:32 - 11:12:36]
same thing but one is the newer version

[11:12:34 - 11:12:38]
so GF is a binary format that is

[11:12:36 - 11:12:41]
designed explicitly for fast loading and

[11:12:38 - 11:12:43]
saving of models ggf is specifically

[11:12:41 - 11:12:45]
designed to store inference models and

[11:12:43 - 11:12:48]
perform well on consumer GR computer

[11:12:45 - 11:12:50]
hardware ggf supports fine-tuning models

[11:12:48 - 11:12:52]
initially developed in Frameworks like

[11:12:50 - 11:12:55]
pytorch can be converted to ggf format

[11:12:52 - 11:12:57]
for the use of those engines so here on

[11:12:55 - 11:13:00]
the right hand side um we're looking

[11:12:57 - 11:13:03]
inside of hugging face at Google gemma's

[11:13:00 - 11:13:07]
uh llm and you can see that they have a

[11:13:03 - 11:13:10]
ggf file and ggf files can be executed

[11:13:07 - 11:13:13]
by olama GPT for all and llama

[11:13:10 - 11:13:16]
CPP um I don't know if it's CCP or CPP I

[11:13:13 - 11:13:17]
sometimes get that wrong um but uh

[11:13:16 - 11:13:20]
that's probably just a spelling mistake

[11:13:17 - 11:13:22]
let me just take a look here llama it's

[11:13:20 - 11:13:24]
llama CPP so yeah it's supposed to be

[11:13:22 - 11:13:29]
llama CPP not

[11:13:24 - 11:13:30]
CCP um I apologize for that but anyway

[11:13:29 - 11:13:34]
uh that kind of makes sense because when

[11:13:30 - 11:13:37]
we utilize old llama which is a um a way

[11:13:34 - 11:13:38]
of serving models very easily on uh

[11:13:37 - 11:13:41]
consumer grade machines like your

[11:13:38 - 11:13:43]
laptops or desktop that having that ggf

[11:13:41 - 11:13:46]
file I could see that being a great

[11:13:43 - 11:13:49]
benefit uh there but yeah there you

[11:13:46 - 11:13:52]
[Music]

[11:13:49 - 11:13:54]
go let's take a look at context window

[11:13:52 - 11:13:57]
caching also known as prompt caching or

[11:13:54 - 11:13:58]
contact caching is when the computed

[11:13:57 - 11:14:01]
context is stored in memory to help

[11:13:58 - 11:14:02]
improve response times for llms and

[11:14:01 - 11:14:04]
where prom caching would be utilized

[11:14:02 - 11:14:06]
would be chat Bots with extensive system

[11:14:04 - 11:14:09]
instructions repetitive analysis of

[11:14:06 - 11:14:11]
lengthy video files recre queries

[11:14:09 - 11:14:13]
against large document sets frequent

[11:14:11 - 11:14:15]
code repository analysis or bug fixing

[11:14:13 - 11:14:17]
prom caching is offered offered by some

[11:14:15 - 11:14:18]
providers for very specific model

[11:14:17 - 11:14:20]
versions I'm not listing the model

[11:14:18 - 11:14:23]
versions here but I'm telling you of two

[11:14:20 - 11:14:24]
providers that do context window caching

[11:14:23 - 11:14:27]
the first is Google Gemini and the

[11:14:24 - 11:14:29]
second is anthropic Cloud I've not seen

[11:14:27 - 11:14:30]
many llms implement it it's not

[11:14:29 - 11:14:34]
something that I I would even know how

[11:14:30 - 11:14:37]
to begin to implement it um uh uh if we

[11:14:34 - 11:14:39]
were to do it locally though maybe it

[11:14:37 - 11:14:41]
wouldn't be that hard if I if we just

[11:14:39 - 11:14:42]
talk about it for just a second here but

[11:14:41 - 11:14:45]
here's an implementation of Google

[11:14:42 - 11:14:47]
Gemini and so here if we'll get the pen

[11:14:45 - 11:14:51]
tool out so we make it a little bit more

[11:14:47 - 11:14:55]
clear here but the idea is that um uh

[11:14:51 - 11:14:57]
using the Google uh Google Gemini um API

[11:14:55 - 11:15:00]
here we create a Content cache and we

[11:14:57 - 11:15:02]
are providing um in here the contents of

[11:15:00 - 11:15:03]
a video file because we said that this

[11:15:02 - 11:15:06]
is really good if we have a very large

[11:15:03 - 11:15:09]
video file or very large document sets

[11:15:06 - 11:15:13]
and the idea is that it's going to um uh

[11:15:09 - 11:15:16]
convert this data into um into the

[11:15:13 - 11:15:18]
format the token format that the LM

[11:15:16 - 11:15:21]
needs to utilize and then the idea is

[11:15:18 - 11:15:23]
that every time we invoke the model it

[11:15:21 - 11:15:26]
doesn't have to take that data and

[11:15:23 - 11:15:28]
convert it into its tokenized formats

[11:15:26 - 11:15:30]
right so if we wanted to implement this

[11:15:28 - 11:15:32]
ourselves um it would be really tricky

[11:15:30 - 11:15:34]
because what we would have to do is we'd

[11:15:32 - 11:15:36]
have to understand the architecture of

[11:15:34 - 11:15:37]
the model and take off part of the model

[11:15:36 - 11:15:40]
that does the

[11:15:37 - 11:15:42]
tokenization um and and be able to take

[11:15:40 - 11:15:44]
the data and tokenize it and then also

[11:15:42 - 11:15:46]
inject the data after that tokenization

[11:15:44 - 11:15:48]
step step so you can see you'd have to

[11:15:46 - 11:15:50]
really mangle a model to do it um but

[11:15:48 - 11:15:53]
anyway this thing is really great but

[11:15:50 - 11:15:56]
it's only for very specific models um

[11:15:53 - 11:15:58]
Not only would you gain um uh improved

[11:15:56 - 11:16:00]
response times for very large files or

[11:15:58 - 11:16:02]
large documents but you could also save

[11:16:00 - 11:16:04]
money so for example with Google Gemini

[11:16:02 - 11:16:05]
the cash tokens might be build at a

[11:16:04 - 11:16:07]
reduced rate and what I say might they

[11:16:05 - 11:16:09]
are um but I don't know if that's the

[11:16:07 - 11:16:11]
same with anthropic Cloud Sonet and I've

[11:16:09 - 11:16:12]
only again seen this in a few models so

[11:16:11 - 11:16:14]
it's not like it's ubiquitous with all

[11:16:12 - 11:16:16]
models um but it is something that's

[11:16:14 - 11:16:17]
worth checking out if you are doing one

[11:16:16 - 11:16:21]
of those two things working with very

[11:16:17 - 11:16:22]
large files or um uh video files or

[11:16:21 - 11:16:26]
large documents

[11:16:22 - 11:16:29]
[Music]

[11:16:26 - 11:16:31]
okay so structure Json is when you want

[11:16:29 - 11:16:32]
to force an element to produce structure

[11:16:31 - 11:16:35]
Json as its output and there are

[11:16:32 - 11:16:37]
multiple techniques to force structure

[11:16:35 - 11:16:39]
Json there's context free grammar uh

[11:16:37 - 11:16:41]
finite State machines and reg xes that

[11:16:39 - 11:16:43]
you can utilize um and structured output

[11:16:41 - 11:16:46]
can be a thirdparty library or it's

[11:16:43 - 11:16:48]
built into the API of an llm and so then

[11:16:46 - 11:16:50]
they're Implement implementing another

[11:16:48 - 11:16:53]
step um and so there's multiple

[11:16:50 - 11:16:54]
strategies but from experience I find

[11:16:53 - 11:16:57]
that trying to get structured Json

[11:16:54 - 11:17:00]
telling an llm to just give you Jason

[11:16:57 - 11:17:03]
back is not easy and so you really do

[11:17:00 - 11:17:06]
need a secondary step outside of the llm

[11:17:03 - 11:17:07]
to force it to do exactly what you want

[11:17:06 - 11:17:08]
and let's just talk about generally how

[11:17:07 - 11:17:11]
this process works well the idea is that

[11:17:08 - 11:17:13]
you have an input you have an llm and

[11:17:11 - 11:17:15]
then uh what you're doing is that every

[11:17:13 - 11:17:18]
time it produces a letter

[11:17:15 - 11:17:20]
okay you have some kind of schema that

[11:17:18 - 11:17:23]
is implemented either represented pantic

[11:17:20 - 11:17:25]
or or Jason schema and the idea is that

[11:17:23 - 11:17:28]
it's going to force the next letter to

[11:17:25 - 11:17:29]
be what would make sense so if you're

[11:17:28 - 11:17:30]
producing Json and if it's the first

[11:17:29 - 11:17:34]
thing the first thing should either be a

[11:17:30 - 11:17:35]
square brace or curly so if the LM the

[11:17:34 - 11:17:38]
first token comes out of it is not a

[11:17:35 - 11:17:39]
square brace or curly which it does not

[11:17:38 - 11:17:42]
match the regular expression that it

[11:17:39 - 11:17:43]
will throw it away until it matches what

[11:17:42 - 11:17:46]
it expects it to match right and so

[11:17:43 - 11:17:48]
you're basically forc it token by token

[11:17:46 - 11:17:51]
to produce exactly what you want um and

[11:17:48 - 11:17:53]
so hopefully that makes sense uh but

[11:17:51 - 11:17:55]
yeah this stuff gets really complicated

[11:17:53 - 11:17:57]
some LMS will tell you that the LM to

[11:17:55 - 11:17:59]
generate uh that you have to tell the LM

[11:17:57 - 11:18:01]
to generate Json so for example if we're

[11:17:59 - 11:18:04]
using coh here coh here specifically

[11:18:01 - 11:18:06]
says tell it to generate out uh Json but

[11:18:04 - 11:18:09]
for the most part if you're using a

[11:18:06 - 11:18:13]
thirdparty library that is not part of

[11:18:09 - 11:18:15]
the um part of the uh API of the llm

[11:18:13 - 11:18:17]
then you don't have to do that

[11:18:15 - 11:18:20]
okay but let's take a look at um two

[11:18:17 - 11:18:21]
ways that we can uh use structure Json

[11:18:20 - 11:18:23]
specifically where it's built into apis

[11:18:21 - 11:18:25]
and a separate video we'll look at how

[11:18:23 - 11:18:27]
we can use a third party to do it so

[11:18:25 - 11:18:28]
with open AI they have an API for

[11:18:27 - 11:18:32]
structured output that requires the use

[11:18:28 - 11:18:35]
of pantic pantic is um this validation

[11:18:32 - 11:18:38]
tool for validating structures of data

[11:18:35 - 11:18:40]
in um Python and the thing is is that

[11:18:38 - 11:18:42]
you can use this to represent your Json

[11:18:40 - 11:18:44]
so it does get converted to Json at some

[11:18:42 - 11:18:46]
point but this is something you'll

[11:18:44 - 11:18:48]
commonly see with structured outputs is

[11:18:46 - 11:18:51]
they'll want pantic and so here we're

[11:18:48 - 11:18:53]
defining um I want like uh a bunch of

[11:18:51 - 11:18:55]
phrases and then those phrases are

[11:18:53 - 11:18:57]
represented by action verbs and so then

[11:18:55 - 11:18:59]
I would pass that in as the response

[11:18:57 - 11:19:01]
format and that would produce back Json

[11:18:59 - 11:19:04]
I have another example here with coh

[11:19:01 - 11:19:06]
here and it uses the Json schema based

[11:19:04 - 11:19:08]
on the Json schema.org website and this

[11:19:06 - 11:19:11]
is the exact same thing that we're

[11:19:08 - 11:19:13]
asking uh uh but now we have to use a

[11:19:11 - 11:19:15]
Json scheme instead of pantic and then

[11:19:13 - 11:19:19]
we're going to pass that along

[11:19:15 - 11:19:20]
um as the response format um so yeah but

[11:19:19 - 11:19:22]
I do want to point out that getting

[11:19:20 - 11:19:24]
structure Jason back is very challenging

[11:19:22 - 11:19:26]
and sometimes you'll find that if you

[11:19:24 - 11:19:28]
make it too complicated it gives really

[11:19:26 - 11:19:31]
bad results sometimes the naming of the

[11:19:28 - 11:19:35]
actual uh things within the uh the Json

[11:19:31 - 11:19:38]
object really help it um and so yeah you

[11:19:35 - 11:19:39]
really have to work hard to get um Json

[11:19:38 - 11:19:42]
output back and sometimes it forces you

[11:19:39 - 11:19:44]
to use specific models because sometimes

[11:19:42 - 11:19:46]
the only time you get reliable results

[11:19:44 - 11:19:47]
is like with something with open AI uh

[11:19:46 - 11:19:49]
and the only thing that's kind of

[11:19:47 - 11:19:52]
frustrating is that we don't know

[11:19:49 - 11:19:54]
exactly how their um structure Json

[11:19:52 - 11:19:56]
works and a lot of times these are beta

[11:19:54 - 11:19:58]
features and so I don't know if these

[11:19:56 - 11:20:00]
features will vanish in the future uh in

[11:19:58 - 11:20:01]
favor of third-party ones but we will

[11:20:00 - 11:20:03]
look at thirdparty ones that we can

[11:20:01 - 11:20:07]
Implement as well

[11:20:03 - 11:20:09]
[Music]

[11:20:07 - 11:20:11]
okay let's take a look at instructor

[11:20:09 - 11:20:13]
which is a thirdparty library that can

[11:20:11 - 11:20:15]
produce structure Json output I was

[11:20:13 - 11:20:17]
super excited to find this as there was

[11:20:15 - 11:20:19]
a bunch of other ones that didn't really

[11:20:17 - 11:20:21]
work but this one worked perfectly at

[11:20:19 - 11:20:23]
least for the code examples that I

[11:20:21 - 11:20:26]
pulled up for it uh which we can find at

[11:20:23 - 11:20:26]
python. usinor

[11:20:27 - 11:20:30]
docomo um the only ones that I kind of

[11:20:29 - 11:20:33]
wish were there was something like

[11:20:30 - 11:20:35]
Amazon Bedrock but I understand that

[11:20:33 - 11:20:38]
it's not there at this time um but

[11:20:35 - 11:20:40]
anyway uh here is a simple example of

[11:20:38 - 11:20:42]
Gro and actually when we use gro we end

[11:20:40 - 11:20:44]
up utilizing this implementation you can

[11:20:42 - 11:20:47]
see that this one is utilizing python

[11:20:44 - 11:20:52]
gantic um but the idea is that you can

[11:20:47 - 11:20:55]
basically uh use um this outputed format

[11:20:52 - 11:20:57]
with any of these things so you like

[11:20:55 - 11:20:58]
it's not reliant on the built-in one

[11:20:57 - 11:21:02]
it'll just work with all these which I

[11:20:58 - 11:21:06]
think is really cool uh but there you go

[11:21:02 - 11:21:08]
[Music]

[11:21:06 - 11:21:10]
okay hey this is angre brown and this

[11:21:08 - 11:21:12]
video I want to take a look at web UI so

[11:21:10 - 11:21:14]
web UI I believe it's called Web

[11:21:12 - 11:21:17]
UI if it's not we'll find out what is

[11:21:14 - 11:21:20]
maybe it's called open web UI and so I'm

[11:21:17 - 11:21:22]
told that this thing allows us to have a

[11:21:20 - 11:21:24]
friendly chat UI interface that we can

[11:21:22 - 11:21:26]
use with olama or stuff like that and

[11:21:24 - 11:21:29]
this is probably a great idea if we can

[11:21:26 - 11:21:31]
get this working because if you have a

[11:21:29 - 11:21:35]
decent CPU or

[11:21:31 - 11:21:39]
GPU and let's say Chach PT is down or

[11:21:35 - 11:21:42]
Claud is down you can use open AI models

[11:21:39 - 11:21:44]
or open AI models open source models to

[11:21:42 - 11:21:46]
get something similar so this is

[11:21:44 - 11:21:47]
something I would would like to try out

[11:21:46 - 11:21:48]
um and if it works out of course I'll

[11:21:47 - 11:21:50]
include it so if you're watching this

[11:21:48 - 11:21:52]
video then that's the case but seems

[11:21:50 - 11:21:55]
like it's very easy to install it says

[11:21:52 - 11:21:56]
open webui so we have Pip install open

[11:21:55 - 11:21:58]
webui and then we serve it if it's that

[11:21:56 - 11:22:00]
simple that'd be great we could also run

[11:21:58 - 11:22:02]
as a Docker container I do like running

[11:22:00 - 11:22:04]
things as Docker

[11:22:02 - 11:22:06]
containers so if is on your computer it

[11:22:04 - 11:22:09]
is if ol is on a different computer we

[11:22:06 - 11:22:11]
can do that so question is what should

[11:22:09 - 11:22:12]
we do should we run it this way or that

[11:22:11 - 11:22:14]
way I kind of like the idea of running

[11:22:12 - 11:22:16]
as a Docker container so I think I'm

[11:22:14 - 11:22:17]
going to do that here today I do believe

[11:22:16 - 11:22:20]
that Docker is installed on this

[11:22:17 - 11:22:22]
computer if it's not we should install

[11:22:20 - 11:22:24]
it

[11:22:22 - 11:22:27]
um let me take a look here so I'm going

[11:22:24 - 11:22:29]
to type in clear do we have Docker on

[11:22:27 - 11:22:31]
this we do not so I'm going to go ahead

[11:22:29 - 11:22:33]
and type it uh install so pseudo snap

[11:22:31 - 11:22:33]
install

[11:22:33 - 11:22:38]
Docker and I'm not sure what the

[11:22:35 - 11:22:40]
password is but maybe that's the

[11:22:38 - 11:22:41]
password and so I'm going to install

[11:22:40 - 11:22:44]
Docker and we're going to see if we can

[11:22:41 - 11:22:46]
run this within WSL if we can that'd be

[11:22:44 - 11:22:46]
great

[11:22:46 - 11:22:50]
all right so supposedly that is now

[11:22:48 - 11:22:52]
installed I'm going to go over to

[11:22:50 - 11:22:56]
here and I'm going to

[11:22:52 - 11:22:58]
grab um this one here and we're going to

[11:22:56 - 11:23:01]
make our way back over to

[11:22:58 - 11:23:05]
here I'm going to paste this in

[11:23:01 - 11:23:07]
here and so we have uh denied because we

[11:23:05 - 11:23:08]
have Docker installed but I guess we

[11:23:07 - 11:23:11]
need pseudo for it I actually don't like

[11:23:08 - 11:23:12]
it when it's installed with pseudo um

[11:23:11 - 11:23:13]
but since I use pseudo snap installed

[11:23:12 - 11:23:16]
I'm not exactly sure how to fix that so

[11:23:13 - 11:23:17]
I'm just going to type in Pudo and this

[11:23:16 - 11:23:19]
will probably still work but it's not

[11:23:17 - 11:23:22]
exactly the way I'd like to do it so now

[11:23:19 - 11:23:24]
it's pulling the

[11:23:22 - 11:23:27]
image at some point I will go figure out

[11:23:24 - 11:23:29]
how to uh use Docker without pseudo if I

[11:23:27 - 11:23:30]
if it was a manual install I would

[11:23:29 - 11:23:32]
absolutely know how to fix that but not

[11:23:30 - 11:23:35]
with pseudo

[11:23:32 - 11:23:36]
snap and so we will pull this Docker

[11:23:35 - 11:23:37]
container and we'll just wait a little

[11:23:36 - 11:23:41]
bit

[11:23:37 - 11:23:43]
here all right so um that's now pulled

[11:23:41 - 11:23:45]
now it's not running per se I thought

[11:23:43 - 11:23:47]
maybe we would just run as we did it

[11:23:45 - 11:23:48]
there um so we're going to grab this one

[11:23:47 - 11:23:51]
more time we actually aren't running are

[11:23:48 - 11:23:53]
we running AMA right now it is

[11:23:51 - 11:23:55]
running okay so make sure that it's

[11:23:53 - 11:23:56]
open and I'm going to go ahead and paste

[11:23:55 - 11:23:58]
this in I'm not sure if it's going to

[11:23:56 - 11:24:00]
work from here but we have again it's

[11:23:58 - 11:24:04]
the uh that issue there so I'll type in

[11:24:00 - 11:24:06]
pseudo and it says already in use oh you

[11:24:04 - 11:24:08]
know what maybe it's running in the

[11:24:06 - 11:24:11]
background okay so I'm going to do

[11:24:08 - 11:24:15]
Docker Docker PS pseudo Docker PS that's

[11:24:11 - 11:24:18]
going to drive me crazy how can we use

[11:24:15 - 11:24:20]
use Docker without pseudo because I'm

[11:24:18 - 11:24:23]
not I'm not GNA stand for

[11:24:20 - 11:24:23]
that

[11:24:25 - 11:24:30]
and really depends on how we've

[11:24:27 - 11:24:30]
installed

[11:24:31 - 11:24:37]
it ster

[11:24:34 - 11:24:39]
D it's something like this so like

[11:24:37 - 11:24:42]
Docker User

[11:24:39 - 11:24:45]
Group

[11:24:42 - 11:24:46]
yeah I do have instructions yeah to run

[11:24:45 - 11:24:48]
a Docker command without pseudo you need

[11:24:46 - 11:24:50]
to add your user who has root privileges

[11:24:48 - 11:24:53]
to the docker group okay well let's just

[11:24:50 - 11:24:55]
try that maybe that will fix our problem

[11:24:53 - 11:24:58]
because that'd be a lot nicer to do

[11:24:55 - 11:24:59]
that yeah because I use pseudo snap I

[11:24:58 - 11:25:01]
kind of regret installing it that way I

[11:24:59 - 11:25:03]
might end up uninstalling Docker just so

[11:25:01 - 11:25:05]
that it's done correctly but for now it

[11:25:03 - 11:25:09]
is running so we say pseudo dock pseudo

[11:25:05 - 11:25:12]
Docker uh PS and it says this running on

[11:25:09 - 11:25:15]
Port 880 or it's Port 3000 we'll find

[11:25:12 - 11:25:19]
out here in just a moment

[11:25:15 - 11:25:19]
so let's try uh 8080

[11:25:19 - 11:25:23]
first if it's not then it's Port 3,000 I

[11:25:22 - 11:25:26]
can never remember what direction it

[11:25:23 - 11:25:27]
goes in it's never very clear yeah see I

[11:25:26 - 11:25:31]
would have thought it would have been

[11:25:27 - 11:25:33]
Port 80 8080 because it's like for 3000

[11:25:31 - 11:25:36]
to 880 but really it's 3,000 goes to

[11:25:33 - 11:25:38]
Port 880 and so here we are in our

[11:25:36 - 11:25:41]
environment it's very

[11:25:38 - 11:25:43]
interesting get start with open open web

[11:25:41 - 11:25:45]
UI open webui does not make any external

[11:25:43 - 11:25:47]
Connections in your data securely stays

[11:25:45 - 11:25:49]
here okay so I assume I'm creating one

[11:25:47 - 11:25:50]
locally I'm not sure why I have to enter

[11:25:49 - 11:25:52]
a password

[11:25:50 - 11:25:56]
in okay but I'm going to do a very

[11:25:52 - 11:25:56]
simple password for

[11:25:57 - 11:26:03]
this and yeah I'm not sure if it sends

[11:26:00 - 11:26:05]
any data out but anyway we have it here

[11:26:03 - 11:26:08]
and so now we have

[11:26:05 - 11:26:09]
this and there are no models here so I

[11:26:08 - 11:26:10]
think maybe if we say like hello it's

[11:26:09 - 11:26:12]
probably not going to work let's try

[11:26:10 - 11:26:14]
this because there's no model selected

[11:26:12 - 11:26:17]
right so in order for this to work we're

[11:26:14 - 11:26:18]
going to have to add a model but you can

[11:26:17 - 11:26:20]
see we don't have any models and as we

[11:26:18 - 11:26:23]
press plus it's getting confused so

[11:26:20 - 11:26:25]
let's open uh terminal

[11:26:23 - 11:26:28]
here and let's

[11:26:25 - 11:26:30]
install a model so say

[11:26:28 - 11:26:32]
olama I kind of forget what it is go

[11:26:30 - 11:26:32]
here

[11:26:33 - 11:26:40]
AMA

[11:26:36 - 11:26:41]
and maybe it's like AMA pole oama pole I

[11:26:40 - 11:26:46]
think that's what it is

[11:26:41 - 11:26:49]
pole uh uh llama

[11:26:46 - 11:26:52]
3.2 1B I'm really just guessing

[11:26:49 - 11:26:54]
here no that's not

[11:26:52 - 11:26:56]
it I mean gemma's supposed to be pretty

[11:26:54 - 11:26:59]
good maybe we'll try to pull the two

[11:26:56 - 11:26:59]
billion parameter one of

[11:27:00 - 11:27:04]
Gemma I just want to pull it I don't

[11:27:02 - 11:27:06]
want to run it so we go ahead and pull

[11:27:04 - 11:27:08]
it like

[11:27:06 - 11:27:11]
that and so we'll wait for that to

[11:27:08 - 11:27:13]
download be back in just a moment all

[11:27:11 - 11:27:15]
right so we've downloaded a particular

[11:27:13 - 11:27:18]
model I'm going to go back over to our

[11:27:15 - 11:27:19]
web UI interface again don't have much

[11:27:18 - 11:27:22]
experience with this but we're going to

[11:27:19 - 11:27:26]
find out does it show

[11:27:22 - 11:27:29]
up okay and so if I drop down it doesn't

[11:27:26 - 11:27:32]
see the old Lama model now I'm not sure

[11:27:29 - 11:27:34]
if it's because I'm in WSL in a Docker

[11:27:32 - 11:27:35]
container and it's just not aware of it

[11:27:34 - 11:27:37]
on that

[11:27:35 - 11:27:40]
Network

[11:27:37 - 11:27:42]
um so that's a good question yeah I'm

[11:27:40 - 11:27:45]
not sure that seems like a very hard

[11:27:42 - 11:27:48]
thing for it to figure out

[11:27:45 - 11:27:51]
[Music]

[11:27:48 - 11:27:54]
so I think maybe what I would

[11:27:51 - 11:27:57]
do I'm going sign out of here I'm going

[11:27:54 - 11:27:59]
to try to run it the other way because

[11:27:57 - 11:28:02]
this is running

[11:27:59 - 11:28:05]
well yeah because this is running right

[11:28:02 - 11:28:08]
now in WSL and if we type in O

[11:28:05 - 11:28:09]
Lama like o Lama is not accessible here

[11:28:08 - 11:28:11]
and so I have it on the exterior so it

[11:28:09 - 11:28:13]
really depends like do I want it on the

[11:28:11 - 11:28:14]
exterior or in the interior because

[11:28:13 - 11:28:16]
otherwise it's not going to it is so

[11:28:14 - 11:28:17]
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go

[11:28:16 - 11:28:19]
over

[11:28:17 - 11:28:23]
to here I'm going to

[11:28:19 - 11:28:27]
say um ol

[11:28:23 - 11:28:32]
remove Gemma 22

[11:28:27 - 11:28:32]
billion ama ama let's see here

[11:28:32 - 11:28:39]
AMA Gemma 2

[11:28:36 - 11:28:41]
2B okay

[11:28:39 - 11:28:43]
and so now I have nothing inama there

[11:28:41 - 11:28:45]
but I'm going to install AMA on this

[11:28:43 - 11:28:48]
side

[11:28:45 - 11:28:48]
say pseudo snap

[11:28:50 - 11:28:54]
install because that's all I can really

[11:28:52 - 11:28:57]
think of is the fact that it doesn't

[11:28:54 - 11:28:59]
know of AMA on the window side in WSL

[11:28:57 - 11:29:00]
this is where like networking becomes

[11:28:59 - 11:29:03]
really important I was just working with

[11:29:00 - 11:29:05]
Tim um and and in the boot camp you'll

[11:29:03 - 11:29:06]
see Tim as we worked on a project but

[11:29:05 - 11:29:07]
his background is more networking my

[11:29:06 - 11:29:09]
background is more development and I

[11:29:07 - 11:29:12]
feel like for him this is like nothing

[11:29:09 - 11:29:13]
to figure out but but for me it's it's

[11:29:12 - 11:29:15]
very challenging also B would probably

[11:29:13 - 11:29:18]
have an easy time with it but we'll

[11:29:15 - 11:29:18]
again we'll pull down this in a

[11:29:18 - 11:29:23]
moment okay there we go so now's

[11:29:21 - 11:29:27]
installed so we'll say olama

[11:29:23 - 11:29:32]
pole on this

[11:29:27 - 11:29:32]
side uh this one

[11:29:33 - 11:29:37]
here ol Lama

[11:29:35 - 11:29:40]
pole maybe the other issue is that it's

[11:29:37 - 11:29:42]
not running but I'm hoping that if it's

[11:29:40 - 11:29:44]
aware of a Lama that it should be able

[11:29:42 - 11:29:45]
to know models that are there there not

[11:29:44 - 11:29:47]
necessarily whether they're running and

[11:29:45 - 11:29:51]
then it would start them up but this is

[11:29:47 - 11:29:51]
pulling pretty quick so it's not that

[11:30:03 - 11:30:09]
bad okay so it's almost done

[11:30:07 - 11:30:12]
there all right so we pulled the model

[11:30:09 - 11:30:14]
let's go back over uh to Local Host

[11:30:12 - 11:30:18]
again and maybe maybe has to be running

[11:30:14 - 11:30:22]
cuz you know we don't have those exact

[11:30:18 - 11:30:22]
instructions uh so I'll go log in

[11:30:23 - 11:30:27]
here yeah I think it's just like local

[11:30:25 - 11:30:30]
server so maybe like if you had a bunch

[11:30:27 - 11:30:31]
of people you know that that want to use

[11:30:30 - 11:30:35]
it so again it's not running here so

[11:30:31 - 11:30:38]
I'll go ahead and we'll say

[11:30:35 - 11:30:39]
um ol llama we'll sit up here and I'll

[11:30:38 - 11:30:41]
just say

[11:30:39 - 11:30:45]
run yeah maybe web UI is good if like

[11:30:41 - 11:30:47]
you have a a network of um like you have

[11:30:45 - 11:30:50]
local compute and you have um a local

[11:30:47 - 11:30:51]
network that you want to serve and maybe

[11:30:50 - 11:30:54]
that's something that could be there

[11:30:51 - 11:30:56]
let's go give this a refresh

[11:30:54 - 11:30:59]
here okay so I still

[11:30:56 - 11:31:02]
don't I still don't see

[11:30:59 - 11:31:04]
it okay let's give it a read so open web

[11:31:02 - 11:31:06]
ey can be installed with pit python

[11:31:04 - 11:31:08]
package man before proceeding ensure

[11:31:06 - 11:31:10]
you're using python 311 to avoid

[11:31:08 - 11:31:13]
compatibility

[11:31:10 - 11:31:16]
issues um if a llama is on your computer

[11:31:13 - 11:31:16]
uses

[11:31:17 - 11:31:22]
command installing open AI with bundled

[11:31:19 - 11:31:22]
olama

[11:31:22 - 11:31:26]
support with allowing for a streamline

[11:31:25 - 11:31:28]
set up with a single

[11:31:26 - 11:31:34]
command

[11:31:28 - 11:31:34]
okay so here we ran this

[11:31:38 - 11:31:44]
one and it's using the hyphen D flag

[11:31:41 - 11:31:45]
that's how we know it's running still so

[11:31:44 - 11:31:46]
what I'm going to do I'm going to leave

[11:31:45 - 11:31:48]
this tab

[11:31:46 - 11:31:52]
open but I'm going to go into another

[11:31:48 - 11:31:52]
one here and we'll do

[11:31:52 - 11:31:59]
Docker Docker PS pseudo Docker PS I

[11:31:57 - 11:32:03]
really regret installing it via that now

[11:31:59 - 11:32:06]
I have to do that every single time and

[11:32:03 - 11:32:06]
I want to stop this

[11:32:07 - 11:32:11]
container so let's say

[11:32:11 - 11:32:14]
Docker I already forgot what the Comm

[11:32:13 - 11:32:18]
command

[11:32:14 - 11:32:22]
is Docker

[11:32:18 - 11:32:25]
kill um I forgot oh no it is maybe skill

[11:32:22 - 11:32:30]
no no that's not it uh

[11:32:25 - 11:32:30]
Docker PS Docker or sorry pseudo

[11:32:35 - 11:32:42]
Docker it is kill okay it is kill okay

[11:32:38 - 11:32:44]
so pseudo Docker

[11:32:42 - 11:32:46]
kill and so now now that should stop

[11:32:44 - 11:32:48]
stop be not running anymore so we'll do

[11:32:46 - 11:32:50]
this and say Docker

[11:32:48 - 11:32:52]
PS and it's not running anymore so

[11:32:50 - 11:32:54]
that's perfect okay so now what I'll do

[11:32:52 - 11:32:56]
is I'll go back over to here into our

[11:32:54 - 11:32:58]
instructions and I want similar command

[11:32:56 - 11:33:01]
here I just don't want the uh The Hyphen

[11:32:58 - 11:33:03]
D because I want to have control to stop

[11:33:01 - 11:33:05]
and start this so my life's a little bit

[11:33:03 - 11:33:08]
easier so I'm going to go and bring that

[11:33:05 - 11:33:10]
back in over here and we'll go ahead and

[11:33:08 - 11:33:12]
paste this

[11:33:10 - 11:33:15]
in and we'll put pseudo in front of it

[11:33:12 - 11:33:15]
as it always wants pseudo

[11:33:16 - 11:33:19]
and it's complaining because there's

[11:33:17 - 11:33:22]
already a container with that

[11:33:19 - 11:33:24]
name I don't care I'll just call it

[11:33:22 - 11:33:26]
two and so I'm going to go back to my

[11:33:24 - 11:33:29]
browser open this

[11:33:26 - 11:33:31]
up and now it's

[11:33:29 - 11:33:33]
complaining so I'm not really liking

[11:33:31 - 11:33:35]
this I mean like there's probably more

[11:33:33 - 11:33:38]
to it to to get it to run as a container

[11:33:35 - 11:33:40]
like like to read about it but I just

[11:33:38 - 11:33:41]
want this to work so I'm going to take

[11:33:40 - 11:33:45]
the easier route here and we're going to

[11:33:41 - 11:33:45]
just do pip install open web UI

[11:33:46 - 11:33:48]
like

[11:33:48 - 11:33:53]
this and it's now saying there's no

[11:33:51 - 11:33:55]
matching

[11:33:53 - 11:33:58]
distributions

[11:33:55 - 11:33:58]
um you

[11:33:59 - 11:34:03]
sure and probably because right now I'm

[11:34:02 - 11:34:05]
not sure like what python version are we

[11:34:03 - 11:34:06]
using python hyen hyen version this

[11:34:05 - 11:34:09]
one's

[11:34:06 - 11:34:15]
312 so that should work in open your

[11:34:09 - 11:34:15]
terminal and do pip install open web UI

[11:34:19 - 11:34:23]
[Music]

[11:34:22 - 11:34:25]
okay so I'm just thinking about this for

[11:34:23 - 11:34:25]
a

[11:34:25 - 11:34:29]
second okay what we can do is we can go

[11:34:28 - 11:34:32]
here

[11:34:29 - 11:34:35]
and we'll just take a closer look at

[11:34:32 - 11:34:35]
what's going on with

[11:34:35 - 11:34:40]
this so we got

[11:34:38 - 11:34:45]
this we

[11:34:40 - 11:34:49]
have this we have the name which is fine

[11:34:45 - 11:34:55]
we have restart which is fine so you

[11:34:49 - 11:34:55]
know run in run in daming mode use host

[11:34:56 - 11:35:01]
Gateway it's mounting the volume over

[11:35:00 - 11:35:03]
here it's using the name there I'm not

[11:35:01 - 11:35:07]
sure why it cares if the name is the

[11:35:03 - 11:35:11]
same because we do pseudo Docker

[11:35:07 - 11:35:14]
images that should be fine pseudo

[11:35:11 - 11:35:16]
Docker PS there's no container running

[11:35:14 - 11:35:18]
so if I copy this again and I paste it

[11:35:16 - 11:35:18]
in

[11:35:23 - 11:35:28]
again okay we'll hit

[11:35:25 - 11:35:30]
enter the container name is already in

[11:35:28 - 11:35:32]
use by container you had to remove or

[11:35:30 - 11:35:34]
rename the container to be able to use

[11:35:32 - 11:35:37]
that container I just want to use the

[11:35:34 - 11:35:39]
container based on its name okay we'll

[11:35:37 - 11:35:44]
try this hit

[11:35:39 - 11:35:45]
enter there we go okay we'll open it up

[11:35:44 - 11:35:46]
and it doesn't tell me why we're getting

[11:35:45 - 11:35:51]
external error

[11:35:46 - 11:35:51]
now now oh no now it's working okay

[11:35:55 - 11:36:00]
great so try this again Andrew exam

[11:36:02 - 11:36:07]
pro. and then the password I had I'm now

[11:36:05 - 11:36:07]
logged

[11:36:09 - 11:36:14]
in and it just doesn't see oh Lama let's

[11:36:13 - 11:36:17]
go over to set settings let's see what

[11:36:14 - 11:36:19]
we have is our options we have interface

[11:36:17 - 11:36:21]
personalization

[11:36:19 - 11:36:24]
audio account admid

[11:36:21 - 11:36:26]
settings

[11:36:24 - 11:36:27]
connections okay so here we have the

[11:36:26 - 11:36:31]
olama

[11:36:27 - 11:36:34]
API and this says manage API

[11:36:31 - 11:36:35]
connections um so maybe the issue is

[11:36:34 - 11:36:39]
like where it thinks it

[11:36:35 - 11:36:42]
is so I'm going

[11:36:39 - 11:36:45]
to uh go over to chat gbt in another

[11:36:42 - 11:36:50]
window just going to miniz this for a

[11:36:45 - 11:36:50]
second and I'm going to go over to chat

[11:36:50 - 11:36:54]
GPT and so I'm going to go here and just

[11:36:52 - 11:37:00]
say like I'm trying

[11:36:54 - 11:37:05]
to I'm trying to use uh web UI uh to

[11:37:00 - 11:37:11]
load um models from

[11:37:05 - 11:37:15]
olama in the admin section it shows

[11:37:11 - 11:37:18]
this okay so uh I'm not

[11:37:15 - 11:37:24]
sure how it would

[11:37:18 - 11:37:24]
know where my my existing ol install

[11:37:24 - 11:37:27]
is

[11:37:29 - 11:37:33]
okay again terrible at

[11:37:31 - 11:37:37]
networking but I'm not sure if that's

[11:37:33 - 11:37:42]
the default Port like 11434 is where um

[11:37:37 - 11:37:45]
AMA runs AMA default port cuz maybe

[11:37:42 - 11:37:45]
that's what it is it is 11

[11:37:46 - 11:37:49]
434 by default Services running in

[11:37:48 - 11:37:51]
Docker can't directly access local

[11:37:49 - 11:37:54]
hosting your

[11:37:51 - 11:37:56]
machine okay so host do internal to the

[11:37:54 - 11:37:57]
host's IP address so the container can

[11:37:56 - 11:37:59]
rote traffic back to the host system

[11:37:57 - 11:38:01]
okay that makes sense and then if it was

[11:37:59 - 11:38:04]
running it' be on Port

[11:38:01 - 11:38:06]
11434 so that makes

[11:38:04 - 11:38:08]
sense many webu are do configuration for

[11:38:06 - 11:38:11]
lm's frontends include a default

[11:38:08 - 11:38:14]
connection

[11:38:11 - 11:38:16]
string verifying that uh is actually

[11:38:14 - 11:38:18]
running on Port

[11:38:16 - 11:38:20]
11434 that's probably a good indicator

[11:38:18 - 11:38:23]
of something that we'd want to check so

[11:38:20 - 11:38:26]
let's go back over to our remote desktop

[11:38:23 - 11:38:29]
here and I'm going to go back over to vs

[11:38:26 - 11:38:32]
code and I'm going to run this

[11:38:29 - 11:38:37]
here and it says unknown

[11:38:32 - 11:38:37]
Port so I type in oama

[11:38:38 - 11:38:43]
here because it should be running right

[11:38:41 - 11:38:46]
now

[11:38:43 - 11:38:47]
unless we told it to stop right now uh

[11:38:46 - 11:38:49]
yeah yeah I don't maybe it's not oh it

[11:38:47 - 11:38:51]
is right here so I'm just going to hit

[11:38:49 - 11:38:55]
or quit

[11:38:51 - 11:38:55]
buy and so I'm going to type in ama

[11:38:57 - 11:39:01]
serve okay so it says this port's

[11:38:59 - 11:39:02]
already in used now I wonder if this is

[11:39:01 - 11:39:05]
an issue with this one so I'm going to

[11:39:02 - 11:39:08]
quit this one here let me try this

[11:39:05 - 11:39:11]
again okay so it still says it's in use

[11:39:08 - 11:39:14]
I'm going to type in ama

[11:39:11 - 11:39:16]
[Music]

[11:39:14 - 11:39:20]
ol llama

[11:39:16 - 11:39:23]
stop ol llama ol

[11:39:20 - 11:39:23]
llama

[11:39:23 - 11:39:29]
serve whole llama

[11:39:26 - 11:39:32]
serve I mean if it's serve that's fine

[11:39:29 - 11:39:35]
so it already says it's in in Port 11434

[11:39:32 - 11:39:38]
so clearly is already

[11:39:35 - 11:39:38]
running o

[11:39:41 - 11:39:46]
llama serve C cre a model run a model

[11:39:44 - 11:39:49]
pull a model list a

[11:39:46 - 11:39:51]
model okay so clearly AMA is currently

[11:39:49 - 11:39:52]
running it's on it's already running on

[11:39:51 - 11:39:54]
Port

[11:39:52 - 11:39:56]
11434 uh it's not running on this

[11:39:54 - 11:39:59]
computer so there's no way that uh it's

[11:39:56 - 11:39:59]
being taken up from

[11:39:59 - 11:40:02]
[Music]

[11:40:02 - 11:40:05]
there

[11:40:06 - 11:40:11]
okay so if we go back over to our

[11:40:08 - 11:40:11]
browser

[11:40:16 - 11:40:19]
connections I wish you could test the

[11:40:17 - 11:40:20]
connection here that make it a lot

[11:40:19 - 11:40:21]
easier trouble accessing here let's

[11:40:20 - 11:40:24]
click this

[11:40:21 - 11:40:25]
one so if you're experiencing connection

[11:40:24 - 11:40:27]
issues it's often due to webui Doc

[11:40:25 - 11:40:29]
container not being able to reach the

[11:40:27 - 11:40:31]
old llama server uh use the network host

[11:40:29 - 11:40:34]
flag in your Docker command to resolve

[11:40:31 - 11:40:36]
this note that this that the port

[11:40:34 - 11:40:37]
changes from Port 30 to 8080 resulting

[11:40:36 - 11:40:41]
in the

[11:40:37 - 11:40:43]
link okay so I mean like we told like we

[11:40:41 - 11:40:44]
it told us what to do and we did exactly

[11:40:43 - 11:40:46]
that but it's telling us now to use this

[11:40:44 - 11:40:50]
command instead which is

[11:40:46 - 11:40:52]
fine so I'll do Docker PS

[11:40:50 - 11:40:54]
Docker I really don't like the way I've

[11:40:52 - 11:40:57]
installed Docker see if I can I can say

[11:40:54 - 11:40:59]
pseudo pseudo snap uninstall Docker can

[11:40:57 - 11:41:06]
I do

[11:40:59 - 11:41:06]
that how to remove things installed with

[11:41:08 - 11:41:15]
SNAP pseudo snap remove docker

[11:41:16 - 11:41:19]
so first has to stop the service which

[11:41:17 - 11:41:19]
is

[11:41:30 - 11:41:35]
fine how to stop Docker I'm not even

[11:41:35 - 11:41:40]
sure bu it's not usually the way that I

[11:41:38 - 11:41:44]
use it e so usually

[11:41:40 - 11:41:45]
just like maybe like pseudo system STL

[11:41:44 - 11:41:47]
seems like that would be one way of

[11:41:45 - 11:41:50]
stopping it let's go back over here did

[11:41:47 - 11:41:53]
it already stop it no let's try stopping

[11:41:50 - 11:41:53]
it this way yeah see I don't

[11:41:54 - 11:41:57]
know

[11:41:56 - 11:41:59]
[Music]

[11:41:57 - 11:42:01]
from maybe one reason it can't stop is

[11:41:59 - 11:42:03]
because it's running something so let's

[11:42:01 - 11:42:05]
say pseudo Docker

[11:42:03 - 11:42:08]
PS pseudo

[11:42:05 - 11:42:10]
Docker PS yeah okay so now it's saying

[11:42:08 - 11:42:12]
it's not running anymore which is

[11:42:10 - 11:42:13]
great so I'm going just wait a moment

[11:42:12 - 11:42:15]
I'm going to try to uninstall this okay

[11:42:13 - 11:42:18]
all right so I've removed Docker uh

[11:42:15 - 11:42:19]
using pseudo snap because that I again

[11:42:18 - 11:42:21]
greatly regret that I know I've

[11:42:19 - 11:42:23]
installed this prior but I'm going to go

[11:42:21 - 11:42:25]
ahead and like I have installation

[11:42:23 - 11:42:27]
instructions somewhere but I'm going to

[11:42:25 - 11:42:29]
go just look up Docker Ubuntu because

[11:42:27 - 11:42:32]
the instructions that are right on the

[11:42:29 - 11:42:35]
docker website um work a lot better I

[11:42:32 - 11:42:36]
find and so I just have this pulled off

[11:42:35 - 11:42:40]
screen here but I'm just grabbing from

[11:42:36 - 11:42:44]
here wherever it is uh the installation

[11:42:40 - 11:42:44]
instructions m

[11:42:45 - 11:42:48]
it looks

[11:42:48 - 11:42:53]
like this before you install Docker you

[11:42:51 - 11:42:55]
need to set up the docker app repository

[11:42:53 - 11:42:58]
yeah so I'll run through all

[11:42:55 - 11:43:01]
this I don't want to do a pseudo update

[11:42:58 - 11:43:02]
right now um but I'll see if I can get

[11:43:01 - 11:43:04]
away with doing that without a pseudo

[11:43:02 - 11:43:08]
update usually have to do

[11:43:04 - 11:43:10]
it so that could take some time and does

[11:43:08 - 11:43:11]
a pseudo app up get update on both ends

[11:43:10 - 11:43:14]
of it so we're doing one either way I

[11:43:11 - 11:43:15]
guess and so we'll go ahead and do that

[11:43:14 - 11:43:18]
a little bit aggressive on both sides

[11:43:15 - 11:43:22]
but that's fine and then once that's

[11:43:18 - 11:43:22]
done yeah we'll grab all of

[11:43:24 - 11:43:30]
this okay and I'll run that it'll be

[11:43:31 - 11:43:36]
yes and then here notice they have like

[11:43:33 - 11:43:38]
the pseudo Docker run hello hello world

[11:43:36 - 11:43:40]
which I really don't like having to do

[11:43:38 - 11:43:43]
the pseudo which will'll fix in two

[11:43:40 - 11:43:44]
seconds and so we'll paste this in here

[11:43:43 - 11:43:47]
it's going to pull the image that's

[11:43:44 - 11:43:51]
going to run I'm going to look for um uh

[11:43:47 - 11:43:55]
pseudis Docker as there was that

[11:43:51 - 11:43:58]
command that I know that we can

[11:43:55 - 11:43:58]
use

[11:43:58 - 11:44:02]
here oh I guess we could have added the

[11:44:00 - 11:44:04]
group earlier maybe that was the

[11:44:02 - 11:44:05]
problem but I think that it would have

[11:44:04 - 11:44:06]
probably installed if we installed it

[11:44:05 - 11:44:08]
this

[11:44:06 - 11:44:10]
way so I'm going to go ahead and run

[11:44:08 - 11:44:13]
this yeah so created the new group and

[11:44:10 - 11:44:15]
added it so now I want to do Docker uh

[11:44:13 - 11:44:18]
run hello

[11:44:15 - 11:44:21]
world and we'll just H up here for a

[11:44:18 - 11:44:23]
second oh pseudo Docker oh Docker run

[11:44:21 - 11:44:28]
hello world let's try that

[11:44:23 - 11:44:28]
again um you sure about that

[11:44:31 - 11:44:35]
Docker okay maybe just it's not aware of

[11:44:34 - 11:44:39]
the new context of it so we'll go ahead

[11:44:35 - 11:44:43]
and do that Docker there we go so Docker

[11:44:39 - 11:44:45]
run hello world and so now

[11:44:43 - 11:44:48]
oh it's not

[11:44:45 - 11:44:50]
running

[11:44:48 - 11:44:52]
um pseudo

[11:44:50 - 11:44:56]
system

[11:44:52 - 11:44:56]
CTL start Docker

[11:44:58 - 11:45:02]
maybe Docker run hello

[11:45:02 - 11:45:07]
world pseudo Docker run hello

[11:45:11 - 11:45:17]
world oh okay um one second this is

[11:45:15 - 11:45:19]
frustrating this is just

[11:45:17 - 11:45:22]
annoying we'll fix this here uh let's go

[11:45:19 - 11:45:22]
ask chat

[11:45:24 - 11:45:30]
BT works with pseudo how do I oh wait

[11:45:29 - 11:45:32]
it's saying right here connection

[11:45:30 - 11:45:34]
permission denied okay so we still have

[11:45:32 - 11:45:38]
a permissions issue there might be

[11:45:34 - 11:45:40]
something else I've solved this in um

[11:45:38 - 11:45:41]
the Gen training days Workshop because

[11:45:40 - 11:45:43]
this is something that was really

[11:45:41 - 11:45:46]
annoying me having to do pseudo so maybe

[11:45:43 - 11:45:51]
in here I have the code go over to

[11:45:46 - 11:45:54]
here uh maybe not that one maybe this

[11:45:51 - 11:45:57]
one so we have these three lines I'm

[11:45:54 - 11:45:57]
going to just run all three of

[11:45:57 - 11:46:01]
them I think the new group has to be

[11:46:00 - 11:46:02]
like this last one has to run or it's

[11:46:01 - 11:46:04]
not going to take effect this one right

[11:46:02 - 11:46:06]
here obviously the group already exists

[11:46:04 - 11:46:09]
now let's look for Docker okay now we

[11:46:06 - 11:46:09]
have a Docker run hello

[11:46:10 - 11:46:15]
world and and now it ran the hello world

[11:46:12 - 11:46:17]
so so now we are in a ssan world where

[11:46:15 - 11:46:21]
we can work with this in a much easier

[11:46:17 - 11:46:23]
way so I want to go back over to here as

[11:46:21 - 11:46:25]
they said that if we're having issues we

[11:46:23 - 11:46:26]
want to run this one in particular and

[11:46:25 - 11:46:27]
before I run it I'm going to bring it up

[11:46:26 - 11:46:32]
over into

[11:46:27 - 11:46:35]
here okay and we'll bring this one

[11:46:32 - 11:46:38]
down we'll bring this one down because I

[11:46:35 - 11:46:43]
want to see what's going on

[11:46:38 - 11:46:43]
here um yeah and so

[11:46:43 - 11:46:46]
I mean this kind of makes sense like now

[11:46:44 - 11:46:49]
instead of doing that internal IP we're

[11:46:46 - 11:46:51]
just doing this uh explicitly we're not

[11:46:49 - 11:46:54]
mapping uh mapping it we're just saying

[11:46:51 - 11:46:55]
host it's going to run uh 3,000 I kind

[11:46:54 - 11:46:56]
of think this one looks a lot better to

[11:46:55 - 11:46:58]
be

[11:46:56 - 11:47:00]
honest and so it's going to pull that

[11:46:58 - 11:47:02]
image which is

[11:47:00 - 11:47:04]
fine I thought it already had that image

[11:47:02 - 11:47:06]
maybe the path is slightly different so

[11:47:04 - 11:47:08]
it thinks that it's something else um

[11:47:06 - 11:47:11]
yeah we'll pull that down and maybe it

[11:47:08 - 11:47:13]
will be able to detect AMA this

[11:47:11 - 11:47:15]
way all right so it's pulled this

[11:47:13 - 11:47:17]
container I'm assuming that it's running

[11:47:15 - 11:47:19]
and it says it should be running on Port

[11:47:17 - 11:47:22]
uh 3000 I believe so let's take a look

[11:47:19 - 11:47:24]
here and see if uh we have some better

[11:47:22 - 11:47:24]
results

[11:47:25 - 11:47:29]
here okay sometimes it throws that air

[11:47:27 - 11:47:32]
even when there's not a problem so we'll

[11:47:29 - 11:47:32]
try this one more time

[11:47:45 - 11:47:53]
okay um let's do Docker PS here and

[11:47:50 - 11:47:55]
let's see if we can get into this

[11:47:53 - 11:47:59]
um I don't remember the command off my

[11:47:55 - 11:48:01]
top my head but if we had the docker

[11:47:59 - 11:48:03]
extension this will make our lives a lot

[11:48:01 - 11:48:06]
easier working with Docker containers so

[11:48:03 - 11:48:06]
we go ahead and grab

[11:48:08 - 11:48:11]
this all right so I have that Docker

[11:48:10 - 11:48:14]
container installed and we're going to

[11:48:11 - 11:48:14]
give this a refresh here

[11:48:15 - 11:48:20]
permission Deni trying to connect to the

[11:48:17 - 11:48:25]
docker container socket oh come

[11:48:20 - 11:48:27]
on what a pain what an absolute pain um

[11:48:25 - 11:48:28]
you know this this in theory could be

[11:48:27 - 11:48:31]
really good if we can just get it to

[11:48:28 - 11:48:31]
work um

[11:48:31 - 11:48:36]
Docker failed to

[11:48:34 - 11:48:38]
connect

[11:48:36 - 11:48:43]
settings I mean I I installed it the

[11:48:38 - 11:48:43]
most manual way I could install it

[11:48:46 - 11:48:51]
um okay

[11:48:49 - 11:48:53]
well Docker

[11:48:51 - 11:48:55]
permissions Docker

[11:48:53 - 11:48:57]
extension

[11:48:55 - 11:48:59]
permissions vs code maybe there's like

[11:48:57 - 11:49:01]
maybe I can add the vs code thing to the

[11:48:59 - 11:49:04]
thing or

[11:49:01 - 11:49:07]
something uh pseudo group AD group AD

[11:49:04 - 11:49:10]
Docker we did that and we did

[11:49:07 - 11:49:12]
that okay so maybe what I'll

[11:49:10 - 11:49:15]
do CU maybe it's not aware we'll close

[11:49:12 - 11:49:17]
that completely out we'll open up vs

[11:49:15 - 11:49:21]
code

[11:49:17 - 11:49:24]
again sorry and

[11:49:21 - 11:49:25]
uh we'll go back over to Docker once it

[11:49:24 - 11:49:27]
loads maybe it's already loaded and now

[11:49:25 - 11:49:28]
we can see it okay great so all we had

[11:49:27 - 11:49:30]
to do is restart that so that was not

[11:49:28 - 11:49:33]
too

[11:49:30 - 11:49:38]
bad and so what I'm going to do is right

[11:49:33 - 11:49:38]
click this and we can um view the

[11:49:38 - 11:49:43]
logs and so this isn't showing any

[11:49:41 - 11:49:46]
errors it looks like it's running it

[11:49:43 - 11:49:48]
says port 8080 so I wonder if maybe it's

[11:49:46 - 11:49:49]
actually running on Port 880 but I'm

[11:49:48 - 11:49:50]
pretty sure it said it was running on

[11:49:49 - 11:49:53]
Port

[11:49:50 - 11:49:53]
3000 let's try Port

[11:49:54 - 11:50:00]
880 okay so it's actually on Port 880 I

[11:49:57 - 11:50:00]
could have swore it

[11:50:02 - 11:50:08]
said this changes the port from 388 okay

[11:50:06 - 11:50:09]
that's totally fine I'm fine with that

[11:50:08 - 11:50:11]
and so I have to create an account for

[11:50:09 - 11:50:12]
the first time because I guess it's

[11:50:11 - 11:50:16]
storing these locally these accounts so

[11:50:12 - 11:50:17]
just whatever you want them to be and

[11:50:16 - 11:50:21]
I'm just going to put a simple password

[11:50:17 - 11:50:24]
in here and we'll go okay let's

[11:50:21 - 11:50:26]
go there we go nice and so I don't think

[11:50:24 - 11:50:30]
I'm running it um it's just that it's

[11:50:26 - 11:50:34]
pulled so we'll say uh can you produce

[11:50:30 - 11:50:34]
me a simple example of

[11:50:35 - 11:50:39]
pandas okay so we'll go ahead and do

[11:50:40 - 11:50:47]
that there we go that's nice

[11:50:43 - 11:50:48]
now of course this isn't super fast um

[11:50:47 - 11:50:51]
it's fast enough but it is a 7even

[11:50:48 - 11:50:52]
billion uh 7 billion parameter model and

[11:50:51 - 11:50:55]
it's quite impressive that I'm doing

[11:50:52 - 11:50:57]
this locally and so I now have a a local

[11:50:55 - 11:51:01]
UI which is really nice um so I could

[11:50:57 - 11:51:04]
see like if you had a bit more gpus um

[11:51:01 - 11:51:06]
under here I I could see it replacing

[11:51:04 - 11:51:08]
like the smaller models like uh mini and

[11:51:06 - 11:51:11]
things like that not that you ever seem

[11:51:08 - 11:51:13]
to run out of uses for those but um I

[11:51:11 - 11:51:15]
guess if you were doing a large B job uh

[11:51:13 - 11:51:18]
you could do it locally and that would

[11:51:15 - 11:51:19]
be uh very cool um so yeah I mean that's

[11:51:18 - 11:51:21]
all I really wanted to show but you saw

[11:51:19 - 11:51:24]
there was a lot of struggle through

[11:51:21 - 11:51:25]
Docker containers and things like that

[11:51:24 - 11:51:27]
and so it just shows you that um it's

[11:51:25 - 11:51:29]
not all about just working with geni you

[11:51:27 - 11:51:31]
still to know all the tooling around it

[11:51:29 - 11:51:35]
um but anyway that's done so I'm going

[11:51:31 - 11:51:38]
to stop this here and um I guess over

[11:51:35 - 11:51:41]
here we'll do Docker PS and I'm just

[11:51:38 - 11:51:44]
going to go ahead and kill this so say

[11:51:41 - 11:51:44]
Docker uh kill

[11:51:44 - 11:51:49]
Etc the only thing I wonder is like if

[11:51:47 - 11:51:51]
if it's storing the state in here that

[11:51:49 - 11:51:53]
I'm losing those accounts every time

[11:51:51 - 11:51:55]
maybe there's a way to persist it and so

[11:51:53 - 11:51:57]
there probably is a way to connect a a

[11:51:55 - 11:52:00]
store but yeah I could see if you have

[11:51:57 - 11:52:03]
decent compute um within your network

[11:52:00 - 11:52:05]
then everybody could utilize it and um

[11:52:03 - 11:52:06]
that I like that so anyway there you go

[11:52:05 - 11:52:10]
that's

[11:52:06 - 11:52:12]
[Music]

[11:52:10 - 11:52:15]
webui hey this is Angie Brown and video

[11:52:12 - 11:52:16]
I want to take a look at GitHub co-pilot

[11:52:15 - 11:52:17]
um I actually heard it just got a free

[11:52:16 - 11:52:19]
tier and actually it's showing right

[11:52:17 - 11:52:22]
here now available for free up to 50

[11:52:19 - 11:52:24]
chats in 2,000 codes of completion so

[11:52:22 - 11:52:26]
let's go ahead and give that a go um

[11:52:24 - 11:52:28]
hopefully it's as easy as going to here

[11:52:26 - 11:52:30]
to find it and actually we have co-

[11:52:28 - 11:52:32]
pilot open here but what I want to do is

[11:52:30 - 11:52:34]
actually install into vs code apparently

[11:52:32 - 11:52:36]
you can install into a bunch of stuff

[11:52:34 - 11:52:39]
the fact that it could be worked in

[11:52:36 - 11:52:43]
neovim sounds really cool um I'm very

[11:52:39 - 11:52:44]
very tempted to import that into neovim

[11:52:43 - 11:52:46]
um I do not know yeah I have neovim

[11:52:44 - 11:52:47]
installed on this computer but I

[11:52:46 - 11:52:48]
probably should just keep it simple here

[11:52:47 - 11:52:50]
as I don't think everyone could handle

[11:52:48 - 11:52:52]
that so we'll go ahead and click on

[11:52:50 - 11:52:54]
Visual Studio code obviously you should

[11:52:52 - 11:52:56]
have a GitHub account before you do that

[11:52:54 - 11:52:58]
and we have the install button and this

[11:52:56 - 11:52:59]
is going to open up vs code so this is

[11:52:58 - 11:53:01]
clearly going to be my local developer

[11:52:59 - 11:53:03]
environment you can install this into

[11:53:01 - 11:53:06]
GitHub codes spaces but you could also

[11:53:03 - 11:53:07]
install this into um you can install

[11:53:06 - 11:53:10]
into gitpod unfortunately because they

[11:53:07 - 11:53:12]
use a thirdparty Marketplace um at least

[11:53:10 - 11:53:13]
in the current version of G pod classic

[11:53:12 - 11:53:14]
maybe the any when you can so this is

[11:53:13 - 11:53:17]
installed I already actually had it

[11:53:14 - 11:53:19]
installed before um I believe it's done

[11:53:17 - 11:53:21]
an update so sign up for GitHub co-pilot

[11:53:19 - 11:53:23]
free

[11:53:21 - 11:53:25]
um I mean let's click it I I figured I'm

[11:53:23 - 11:53:27]
already signed up okay so I'm over here

[11:53:25 - 11:53:29]
and so we can start our free trial so

[11:53:27 - 11:53:32]
let's go ahead and do

[11:53:29 - 11:53:34]
that oh that's how they get you no no no

[11:53:32 - 11:53:36]
no hold on hold on hold on you're using

[11:53:34 - 11:53:37]
copilot for free okay okay so we don't

[11:53:36 - 11:53:40]
have to do this but at least we know

[11:53:37 - 11:53:43]
it's like $10 a month or $100 a year

[11:53:40 - 11:53:44]
that's not bad for pricing uh in can

[11:53:43 - 11:53:46]
Canadian dollar is not so great our

[11:53:44 - 11:53:48]
dollar is a lot weaker right now so if I

[11:53:46 - 11:53:52]
did 10 USD to

[11:53:48 - 11:53:55]
CAD it's $14 so not the best price for

[11:53:52 - 11:53:58]
Canadians okay but

[11:53:55 - 11:54:00]
um yeah that is what it is now I've

[11:53:58 - 11:54:03]
always found that the code produced by

[11:54:00 - 11:54:07]
Code Pilot is not as good as chat GPT or

[11:54:03 - 11:54:09]
Claude um but we'll see um I also heard

[11:54:07 - 11:54:12]
that you now have the option to change

[11:54:09 - 11:54:15]
uh your model which is something that

[11:54:12 - 11:54:17]
might be interesting to check out so I

[11:54:15 - 11:54:22]
will give that a go here so let me open

[11:54:17 - 11:54:24]
this up and we will take a look at

[11:54:22 - 11:54:27]
co-pilot what I need is I need our our

[11:54:24 - 11:54:28]
actual gen Essentials repo here because

[11:54:27 - 11:54:30]
I think we we'll work in a new project

[11:54:28 - 11:54:32]
here so I'm just going to open up

[11:54:30 - 11:54:35]
terminal I'm not sure if I've already

[11:54:32 - 11:54:37]
downloaded prior do I already have it

[11:54:35 - 11:54:39]
what we called it it's called gen

[11:54:37 - 11:54:40]
Essentials it is not downloaded so I'm

[11:54:39 - 11:54:44]
going to clone it it's a public repo so

[11:54:40 - 11:54:44]
you can clone it as well

[11:54:44 - 11:54:51]
okay but I'm going to go over to GitHub

[11:54:48 - 11:54:53]
here J

[11:54:51 - 11:54:54]
Essentials and we're going to go ahead

[11:54:53 - 11:54:56]
and

[11:54:54 - 11:54:58]
grab the SSH

[11:54:56 - 11:55:01]
here you clone it however you have to

[11:54:58 - 11:55:02]
clone it get clone I'm going to paste

[11:55:01 - 11:55:03]
that in here and that's going to

[11:55:02 - 11:55:04]
download gen Essentials again we could

[11:55:03 - 11:55:06]
have done this in GitHub code spaces I

[11:55:04 - 11:55:08]
just don't feel like launching up GitHub

[11:55:06 - 11:55:10]
code spaces right now and I'm going to

[11:55:08 - 11:55:12]
CD into our gen Essentials directory and

[11:55:10 - 11:55:15]
I'm going to do code period to open that

[11:55:12 - 11:55:18]
up so now we are in uh Visual Studio

[11:55:15 - 11:55:20]
code it is getting ready I'm going to

[11:55:18 - 11:55:22]
make a new folder here called GitHub

[11:55:20 - 11:55:25]
copilot so what I want to do here is to

[11:55:22 - 11:55:28]
see if we can make our link tree clone

[11:55:25 - 11:55:29]
as that would be a good thing to build

[11:55:28 - 11:55:31]
um your GitHub co- pilot access has been

[11:55:29 - 11:55:33]
disabled by the

[11:55:31 - 11:55:35]
organization okay that's fine I just

[11:55:33 - 11:55:37]
want to use the regular GitHub co-pilot

[11:55:35 - 11:55:39]
and so that seems like that shouldn't be

[11:55:37 - 11:55:42]
an

[11:55:39 - 11:55:44]
issue because there's I have we you're

[11:55:42 - 11:55:45]
paying for it at the organization level

[11:55:44 - 11:55:46]
I'm not sure if we've just unsubscribed

[11:55:45 - 11:55:48]
to it

[11:55:46 - 11:55:51]
temporarily so now I'm not

[11:55:48 - 11:55:53]
sure if if uh GitHub co-pilot is is

[11:55:51 - 11:55:55]
working here but let's find out so I'm

[11:55:53 - 11:55:58]
going to type in co-pilot and see if we

[11:55:55 - 11:55:58]
can get working with it

[11:55:58 - 11:56:02]
[Music]

[11:56:02 - 11:56:07]
again okay so I mean last time I used

[11:56:05 - 11:56:08]
this maybe I just got to open up a file

[11:56:07 - 11:56:13]
here it depends on what we want to write

[11:56:08 - 11:56:15]
this in so I really like Ruby and

[11:56:13 - 11:56:17]
I think that I would love to make a

[11:56:15 - 11:56:19]
little fast HTML in r or maybe go I

[11:56:17 - 11:56:21]
don't know go very well so I think that

[11:56:19 - 11:56:23]
that would be a really good challenge to

[11:56:21 - 11:56:24]
write it in go so let's go ahead and see

[11:56:23 - 11:56:27]
if we can do that so we're going to say

[11:56:24 - 11:56:29]
main.go so we know there's a go file

[11:56:27 - 11:56:32]
here yes install the go extension again

[11:56:29 - 11:56:34]
not that I mean I know go but it's it's

[11:56:32 - 11:56:35]
not something I use every day so I'm not

[11:56:34 - 11:56:38]
going to remember how to write go code

[11:56:35 - 11:56:41]
from scratch and so I want to bring up

[11:56:38 - 11:56:43]
the GitHub co-pilot chat which is over

[11:56:41 - 11:56:45]
here uh I don't like it on the right I'd

[11:56:43 - 11:56:47]
rather have it on the

[11:56:45 - 11:56:49]
left um well I can't really figure how

[11:56:47 - 11:56:52]
to drag it so this just going to be what

[11:56:49 - 11:56:54]
it is so go pilot it copile is a powered

[11:56:52 - 11:56:56]
by AI so mistakes are possible review

[11:56:54 - 11:56:58]
the output

[11:56:56 - 11:57:04]
carefully okay

[11:56:58 - 11:57:10]
so um I want to write a API backend for

[11:57:04 - 11:57:15]
a simple um web app that is a link tree

[11:57:10 - 11:57:17]
clone I need to have

[11:57:15 - 11:57:21]
um need to

[11:57:17 - 11:57:21]
have okay let's just see what it can

[11:57:21 - 11:57:26]
do and by the way look down here that we

[11:57:24 - 11:57:28]
can change our model oh we're linking

[11:57:26 - 11:57:30]
between the two so I wonder if we were

[11:57:28 - 11:57:31]
paying if we' get more you think i' know

[11:57:30 - 11:57:33]
because I'm supposed to make a GitHub

[11:57:31 - 11:57:35]
copilot course we're still working on it

[11:57:33 - 11:57:37]
so here's a proposed directory structure

[11:57:35 - 11:57:40]
for the go

[11:57:37 - 11:57:43]
API uh I mean it's a lot of stuff but

[11:57:40 - 11:57:47]
sure we'll create that workspace

[11:57:43 - 11:57:47]
can I not create it in place of where I

[11:57:48 - 11:57:52]
am okay can

[11:57:52 - 11:57:58]
I can we just insert the

[11:57:56 - 11:58:01]
code in

[11:57:58 - 11:58:05]
place I don't really want to make a new

[11:58:01 - 11:58:08]
workspace oh okay well that's not very

[11:58:05 - 11:58:11]
helpful okay um so here I'll just start

[11:58:08 - 11:58:11]
typing

[11:58:12 - 11:58:16]
what's the command for GitHub get GitHub

[11:58:14 - 11:58:18]
co-pilot let's go find out what that is

[11:58:16 - 11:58:21]
I want to go over here command pilot

[11:58:18 - 11:58:21]
GitHub

[11:58:21 - 11:58:26]
[Music]

[11:58:23 - 11:58:29]
co-pilot so here there should be a

[11:58:26 - 11:58:31]
hockey I'm not sure what the hockey

[11:58:29 - 11:58:35]
is but I'm G to just get this out of the

[11:58:31 - 11:58:35]
way for a second so GitHub

[11:58:36 - 11:58:42]
co-pilot

[11:58:39 - 11:58:44]
hotkey vs code seems like the first they

[11:58:42 - 11:58:47]
should be telling you right and so we go

[11:58:44 - 11:58:47]
here and

[11:58:50 - 11:58:55]
[Music]

[11:58:52 - 11:58:57]
so yeah this is not uh this is not

[11:58:55 - 11:58:59]
helpful okay let's go back

[11:58:57 - 11:59:02]
here I wonder if I could just like open

[11:58:59 - 11:59:03]
the code here we go so maybe I can just

[11:59:02 - 11:59:05]
like open the code here and just

[11:59:03 - 11:59:07]
replicate the structure doesn't seem

[11:59:05 - 11:59:08]
like there's any other way to bring it

[11:59:07 - 11:59:11]
uh bring it

[11:59:08 - 11:59:14]
in so here we have a main application

[11:59:11 - 11:59:14]
and then it says link tree

[11:59:15 - 11:59:19]
clone I don't really like the way this

[11:59:17 - 11:59:24]
is written I kind of feel

[11:59:19 - 11:59:24]
like is there any way you can

[11:59:24 - 11:59:30]
simplify the amount of

[11:59:27 - 11:59:32]
files for the go

[11:59:30 - 11:59:34]
app because I feel like it suggested

[11:59:32 - 11:59:37]
stuff is way too much there we go that's

[11:59:34 - 11:59:37]
a lot

[11:59:38 - 11:59:44]
better okay so let's go back over to

[11:59:40 - 11:59:44]
here and so we have main.go

[11:59:45 - 11:59:50]
go.mod go. suum and again I'm not

[11:59:48 - 11:59:51]
expecting you to know any of these I

[11:59:50 - 11:59:55]
feel like go. suum is what gets

[11:59:51 - 11:59:56]
generated and not necessarily um we do

[11:59:55 - 11:59:58]
here what we have this is insert in

[11:59:56 - 12:00:02]
place insert after cursor so we'll go

[11:59:58 - 12:00:04]
into go do uh go do main.go here and

[12:00:02 - 12:00:07]
we'll insert that here we'll go over to

[12:00:04 - 12:00:10]
the next one which is go.mod and we'll

[12:00:07 - 12:00:12]
seert that into here we'll go

[12:00:10 - 12:00:14]
into yeah that's what I thought like

[12:00:12 - 12:00:15]
there's no you wouldn't be doing goome

[12:00:14 - 12:00:18]
that's what you do when you actually

[12:00:15 - 12:00:19]
build the project okay so we have

[12:00:18 - 12:00:23]
main.go

[12:00:19 - 12:00:26]
okay so it's bringing in Jin Jin is a um

[12:00:23 - 12:00:29]
a web framework for go we have go. EnV

[12:00:26 - 12:00:32]
so load A.V file I like that idea we

[12:00:29 - 12:00:35]
have log that is good we have net HTTP

[12:00:32 - 12:00:37]
that's good um we have links I mean

[12:00:35 - 12:00:40]
that's pretty much what we would expect

[12:00:37 - 12:00:42]
it to have it's returning links as a

[12:00:40 - 12:00:44]
string it's not that structured I feel

[12:00:42 - 12:00:46]
like you might want to have a bit more

[12:00:44 - 12:00:48]
like a name and a title on that that's

[12:00:46 - 12:00:51]
fine I

[12:00:48 - 12:00:54]
suppose and we'll go over to go dood so

[12:00:51 - 12:00:54]
that's the two that they're

[12:00:54 - 12:00:59]
installing

[12:00:56 - 12:01:00]
okay so now the next question is like

[12:00:59 - 12:01:04]
okay now how do I start working with

[12:01:00 - 12:01:05]
this okay so how do I build the code and

[12:01:04 - 12:01:08]
run the

[12:01:05 - 12:01:10]
server again it's been a while

[12:01:08 - 12:01:13]
so and I probably don't have go

[12:01:10 - 12:01:15]
installed on this computer but we'll see

[12:01:13 - 12:01:18]
so navigate to the project directory of

[12:01:15 - 12:01:19]
course so we'll CD into GitHub

[12:01:18 - 12:01:23]
co-pilot I'm just going to make a

[12:01:19 - 12:01:23]
subfolder here called uh link tree

[12:01:24 - 12:01:28]
go and I'm going to grab these two it

[12:01:27 - 12:01:30]
actually probably has to be link tree

[12:01:28 - 12:01:33]
clone because the name of the module is

[12:01:30 - 12:01:35]
that and I have a feeling the name

[12:01:33 - 12:01:37]
matters here that's just from from

[12:01:35 - 12:01:39]
memory I just want to rename the folder

[12:01:37 - 12:01:43]
can I there we go sorry I was getting

[12:01:39 - 12:01:45]
mad so go link tree clone and uh we'll

[12:01:43 - 12:01:47]
just CD into link tree clone here I'm

[12:01:45 - 12:01:48]
going to bring this over a little bit so

[12:01:47 - 12:01:51]
this wraps around so we can at least see

[12:01:48 - 12:01:53]
it and so it's suggesting that we can do

[12:01:51 - 12:01:55]
this navigate the project directory oh

[12:01:53 - 12:01:59]
so we have to be up

[12:01:55 - 12:02:01]
one uh do we maybe not let's see what

[12:01:59 - 12:02:02]
happens because that was the folder and

[12:02:01 - 12:02:03]
we didn't tell that we changed the

[12:02:02 - 12:02:05]
folder right so I'm going to go ahead

[12:02:03 - 12:02:07]
and try

[12:02:05 - 12:02:09]
this because Go's not installed so I'm

[12:02:07 - 12:02:12]
going to make a new um new file in here

[12:02:09 - 12:02:12]
read me

[12:02:13 - 12:02:18]
I'm going to go here and say how to

[12:02:15 - 12:02:20]
install go on Ubuntu

[12:02:18 - 12:02:21]
WSL of course if yours is different

[12:02:20 - 12:02:25]
you'll have to figure that

[12:02:21 - 12:02:26]
out and

[12:02:25 - 12:02:28]
so

[12:02:26 - 12:02:31]
[Music]

[12:02:28 - 12:02:33]
um which one do we want I don't know so

[12:02:31 - 12:02:34]
I'll take goang I think it's just

[12:02:33 - 12:02:37]
different

[12:02:34 - 12:02:37]
compilers we'll try this I

[12:02:38 - 12:02:43]
suppose we probably should look up how

[12:02:40 - 12:02:43]
to do it but I'm just going to go for it

[12:02:45 - 12:02:48]
yes go for

[12:02:52 - 12:02:56]
it I mean GCC sounded pretty good too

[12:02:55 - 12:02:59]
but we'll wait for this to install I'll

[12:02:56 - 12:03:01]
be back in just a moment okay all right

[12:02:59 - 12:03:02]
so supposedly we have go installed the

[12:03:01 - 12:03:04]
way we're going to know is if this

[12:03:02 - 12:03:06]
actually works so we go ahead and say go

[12:03:04 - 12:03:08]
run mang

[12:03:06 - 12:03:11]
go

[12:03:08 - 12:03:14]
um it says expected package found and

[12:03:11 - 12:03:16]
Def

[12:03:14 - 12:03:19]
[Music]

[12:03:16 - 12:03:21]
file okay so we'll go back over to here

[12:03:19 - 12:03:21]
this is the main

[12:03:22 - 12:03:25]
package

[12:03:32 - 12:03:37]
okay let's see if it can figure it out

[12:03:34 - 12:03:37]
from here

[12:03:41 - 12:03:46]
is commented out yeah okay that's that's

[12:03:44 - 12:03:49]
what I thought was a bit unusual okay I

[12:03:46 - 12:03:50]
wasn't sure it's been a while but uh

[12:03:49 - 12:03:52]
yeah that that makes sense so let's go

[12:03:50 - 12:03:54]
ahead and run go main go and it is

[12:03:52 - 12:03:56]
compiling so that should compile into an

[12:03:54 - 12:03:58]
individual binary which should be super

[12:03:56 - 12:04:00]
super

[12:03:58 - 12:04:04]
nice so we'll give it a moment

[12:04:00 - 12:04:08]
here and I'm GNA give this a

[12:04:04 - 12:04:10]
refresh so now we have a go go. suum

[12:04:08 - 12:04:12]
file now you can run the server with

[12:04:10 - 12:04:14]
main.go Okay so what did we do we did go

[12:04:12 - 12:04:17]
run

[12:04:14 - 12:04:19]
mango okay

[12:04:17 - 12:04:21]
so oh no no no here they had a build

[12:04:19 - 12:04:23]
okay alternative you can run the server

[12:04:21 - 12:04:24]
directly without building it first oh

[12:04:23 - 12:04:26]
right right right right right fair

[12:04:24 - 12:04:28]
enough okay so I don't know we could

[12:04:26 - 12:04:29]
build it and then run it I guess it

[12:04:28 - 12:04:32]
depends on how we want to do it so then

[12:04:29 - 12:04:32]
we'll say how to

[12:04:32 - 12:04:38]
build okay I kind of like the idea of

[12:04:35 - 12:04:38]
how to build it

[12:04:43 - 12:04:47]
yeah the whole point of this is we

[12:04:44 - 12:04:48]
shouldn't know go we should just rely on

[12:04:47 - 12:04:52]
I mean we should know go to some degree

[12:04:48 - 12:04:54]
but uh run run without building if we

[12:04:52 - 12:04:56]
can do it without having great go

[12:04:54 - 12:04:58]
knowledge then that's going to be really

[12:04:56 - 12:05:01]
good so clearly it's uh it's expecting

[12:04:58 - 12:05:04]
the EMV sh so we'll go ahead and make a

[12:05:01 - 12:05:07]
newv here I'm not sure what I would

[12:05:04 - 12:05:10]
expect from this here so we go back over

[12:05:07 - 12:05:13]
I'm looking for the EnV so we have go.

[12:05:10 - 12:05:15]
EnV right now the only thing that's set

[12:05:13 - 12:05:17]
is port and if it's not set it's going

[12:05:15 - 12:05:19]
to default to Port 880 which is totally

[12:05:17 - 12:05:20]
fine so let's go ahead and hit enter and

[12:05:19 - 12:05:22]
this should get the app running is now

[12:05:20 - 12:05:26]
serving on Port 880 we'll open the

[12:05:22 - 12:05:28]
browser um nothing exciting because uh

[12:05:26 - 12:05:30]
this is not a website right this is an

[12:05:28 - 12:05:33]
API this is an API that we're trying to

[12:05:30 - 12:05:37]
design so I'm going to go back over to

[12:05:33 - 12:05:40]
um our main go file okay and so all it

[12:05:37 - 12:05:42]
has is for SL links and this should

[12:05:40 - 12:05:44]
serve back Json as it say here so I'm

[12:05:42 - 12:05:48]
going to go back over to here and we're

[12:05:44 - 12:05:50]
going to type in for SL links and we get

[12:05:48 - 12:05:52]
back some link examples okay so we're

[12:05:50 - 12:05:55]
starting to get somewhere uh let's go

[12:05:52 - 12:05:57]
back over to

[12:05:55 - 12:05:59]
here and it'd be nice if it starts

[12:05:57 - 12:06:00]
suggesting code I'm not sure why it's

[12:05:59 - 12:06:03]
not doing that just give me a second

[12:06:00 - 12:06:04]
here okay so it's suggesting that if I

[12:06:03 - 12:06:06]
don't see it then maybe there's a

[12:06:04 - 12:06:08]
setting I can change so in file

[12:06:06 - 12:06:09]
preferences settings not sure if that's

[12:06:08 - 12:06:12]
true though but we'll take a look

[12:06:09 - 12:06:14]
preferencing settings

[12:06:12 - 12:06:17]
and maybe there's something for GitHub

[12:06:14 - 12:06:17]
GitHub co-pilot specifically

[12:06:18 - 12:06:21]
co-pilot is

[12:06:22 - 12:06:25]
there okay it's

[12:06:28 - 12:06:31]
[Music]

[12:06:39 - 12:06:43]
enabled uh let's say on

[12:06:45 - 12:06:47]
that's

[12:06:50 - 12:06:55]
missing enable auto completions it seems

[12:06:53 - 12:06:55]
like it is

[12:07:03 - 12:07:07]
enabled all right so that seems fine so

[12:07:05 - 12:07:08]
I'm G to go back over to here but it's

[12:07:07 - 12:07:10]
just like it's not oh now it's

[12:07:08 - 12:07:13]
suggesting okay so maybe that option I

[12:07:10 - 12:07:15]
changed did help a bit so here maybe we

[12:07:13 - 12:07:19]
start documenting to say like I'll go

[12:07:15 - 12:07:19]
here and just say um

[12:07:19 - 12:07:26]
uh

[12:07:21 - 12:07:28]
returns an array of objects with name

[12:07:26 - 12:07:30]
and

[12:07:28 - 12:07:33]
Link

[12:07:30 - 12:07:35]
okay and so I'm hoping that it will

[12:07:33 - 12:07:37]
change

[12:07:35 - 12:07:41]
it co-pilot oh here we

[12:07:37 - 12:07:43]
go um

[12:07:41 - 12:07:46]
comment

[12:07:43 - 12:07:49]
explain editor inline chat here we go

[12:07:46 - 12:07:54]
okay great so now just say uh change

[12:07:49 - 12:07:56]
change to have an array of objects with

[12:07:54 - 12:07:58]
name and Link because that's really what

[12:07:56 - 12:07:58]
we

[12:07:58 - 12:08:05]
want that's GPT 40 so that's better

[12:08:02 - 12:08:08]
we'll go ahead and hit

[12:08:05 - 12:08:10]
accept now we would have to um in order

[12:08:08 - 12:08:11]
to see this we' have to rebuild it every

[12:08:10 - 12:08:14]
time which is not a big deal so if I

[12:08:11 - 12:08:15]
stop this we'll go ahead and run it

[12:08:14 - 12:08:17]
again because it's not going to hot

[12:08:15 - 12:08:20]
reload right at least I don't think it

[12:08:17 - 12:08:24]
is and then we'll go back to

[12:08:20 - 12:08:25]
our browser here give us a nice refresh

[12:08:24 - 12:08:28]
and so now we're getting back the

[12:08:25 - 12:08:30]
structure that is more uh ideal of what

[12:08:28 - 12:08:36]
we want one thing that's not returning

[12:08:30 - 12:08:38]
to us is um I would say a profile so

[12:08:36 - 12:08:43]
that's something we had

[12:08:38 - 12:08:45]
before all right so

[12:08:43 - 12:08:46]
um I'm just thinking what's next so we

[12:08:45 - 12:08:48]
have our links we don't necessarily have

[12:08:46 - 12:08:51]
our profile here which I think I would

[12:08:48 - 12:08:54]
prefer to have

[12:08:51 - 12:08:56]
um I'd have to think about what that

[12:08:54 - 12:08:59]
is but we do have a front end from

[12:08:56 - 12:09:02]
another app so maybe what we should do

[12:08:59 - 12:09:04]
is bring that code into here um I'm just

[12:09:02 - 12:09:06]
trying to think of where I may have

[12:09:04 - 12:09:10]
ridden this code before where it

[12:09:06 - 12:09:11]
actually might be synced into this

[12:09:10 - 12:09:13]
repo hm

[12:09:11 - 12:09:15]
thinking I'm thinking because I don't

[12:09:13 - 12:09:18]
see it in here most likely because I

[12:09:15 - 12:09:20]
didn't copy it into

[12:09:18 - 12:09:23]
[Music]

[12:09:20 - 12:09:26]
here because we used the one that was

[12:09:23 - 12:09:29]
from uh like we generated a a link tree

[12:09:26 - 12:09:32]
using uh what's that platform called um

[12:09:29 - 12:09:35]
lovable right and also we did make one

[12:09:32 - 12:09:35]
with uh

[12:09:35 - 12:09:38]
v0 but I guess the question is like

[12:09:37 - 12:09:40]
should we build our front end with a

[12:09:38 - 12:09:41]
different tool or try to code it all

[12:09:40 - 12:09:43]
from scratch um it's a lot of of work to

[12:09:41 - 12:09:46]
make a front end from scratch so maybe

[12:09:43 - 12:09:48]
we just focus on the API endpoint here

[12:09:46 - 12:09:50]
so I don't know I guess we don't have to

[12:09:48 - 12:09:52]
make a fully working app is I'm just

[12:09:50 - 12:09:53]
being a little bit ridiculous here let's

[12:09:52 - 12:09:54]
go ahead and we'll just try to change

[12:09:53 - 12:09:58]
this a little bit more so we'll go ahead

[12:09:54 - 12:09:59]
and say with this we'll say um uh I need

[12:09:58 - 12:10:01]
to also

[12:09:59 - 12:10:05]
return uh the

[12:10:01 - 12:10:08]
profile information of the user so go

[12:10:05 - 12:10:08]
ahead and do

[12:10:09 - 12:10:14]
that okay and so now we have that new

[12:10:12 - 12:10:17]
structure um I don't think again this

[12:10:14 - 12:10:19]
will appear unless we go and do a hard

[12:10:17 - 12:10:20]
refresh of the rebuild right that makes

[12:10:19 - 12:10:22]
sense because it's a statically

[12:10:20 - 12:10:22]
generated

[12:10:23 - 12:10:27]
app okay so I'm going to go ahead and

[12:10:25 - 12:10:29]
just run it

[12:10:27 - 12:10:31]
again okay so now the next thing I'd

[12:10:29 - 12:10:34]
probably want is I'd want to change the

[12:10:31 - 12:10:38]
code so that um it loads from a database

[12:10:34 - 12:10:42]
so can we load the data from an

[12:10:38 - 12:10:44]
SQL light database

[12:10:42 - 12:10:44]
let's see if it can do

[12:11:04 - 12:11:07]
that okay so we'll go back over to this

[12:11:06 - 12:11:09]
one I'm not exactly sure what it's

[12:11:07 - 12:11:12]
trying to say when we have it like this

[12:11:09 - 12:11:13]
apply an editor

[12:11:12 - 12:11:15]
okay so it added it to the correct file

[12:11:13 - 12:11:17]
that's good uh did it have the version

[12:11:15 - 12:11:18]
before it did okay great so we'll accept

[12:11:17 - 12:11:20]
those

[12:11:18 - 12:11:22]
changes

[12:11:20 - 12:11:24]
um I'm not sure but we'll just go ahead

[12:11:22 - 12:11:26]
and say apply an editor it does jump to

[12:11:24 - 12:11:30]
the file so that's good as

[12:11:26 - 12:11:30]
well so we're waiting for it to make the

[12:11:33 - 12:11:38]
changes there we

[12:11:35 - 12:11:40]
go and so here we can see the clear

[12:11:38 - 12:11:43]
difference so we're importing qite I

[12:11:40 - 12:11:45]
don't know what oh G so

[12:11:43 - 12:11:49]
go and we're creating structs to

[12:11:45 - 12:11:51]
represent the structure of that

[12:11:49 - 12:11:53]
information um here we are loading the

[12:11:51 - 12:11:55]
SQL file called links. DB which is

[12:11:53 - 12:11:56]
totally fine we have DB migrate Auto

[12:11:55 - 12:11:59]
migrate

[12:11:56 - 12:12:00]
so I guess the idea is that we represent

[12:11:59 - 12:12:03]
the database structure up here and then

[12:12:00 - 12:12:05]
we're going to apply the migration

[12:12:03 - 12:12:07]
that's cool I don't think you'd have it

[12:12:05 - 12:12:09]
in your code like this every time but

[12:12:07 - 12:12:12]
for this simple example it's fine

[12:12:09 - 12:12:13]
instead of loading day this way we're

[12:12:12 - 12:12:14]
going to bring the links in this way

[12:12:13 - 12:12:16]
notice that this is only bringing in the

[12:12:14 - 12:12:19]
links and it has ignored the

[12:12:16 - 12:12:22]
profile um but I will accept

[12:12:19 - 12:12:22]
it

[12:12:22 - 12:12:29]
okay and we can always just tweak from

[12:12:25 - 12:12:29]
there so um I also need some test

[12:12:30 - 12:12:36]
data uh

[12:12:33 - 12:12:38]
can can you give me the

[12:12:36 - 12:12:42]
instructions actually we'll go back over

[12:12:38 - 12:12:45]
to here and I'll read me so

[12:12:42 - 12:12:52]
create SQL

[12:12:45 - 12:12:55]
table with some C data SQL SQL

[12:12:52 - 12:12:59]
sqlite table and C

[12:12:55 - 12:12:59]
data run the following

[12:12:59 - 12:13:06]
commands to create and Seed an

[12:13:04 - 12:13:10]
esite table

[12:13:06 - 12:13:13]
database called link. DB so I'm going to

[12:13:10 - 12:13:13]
go here

[12:13:19 - 12:13:22]
and do

[12:13:25 - 12:13:29]
this it's not giving me any suggestions

[12:13:27 - 12:13:32]
which is fine but I'm going to go ahead

[12:13:29 - 12:13:37]
and right click go go pilot um editor in

[12:13:32 - 12:13:39]
line so generate out the example code

[12:13:37 - 12:13:43]
needed let's see if we can go ahead and

[12:13:39 - 12:13:43]
do that based on that context

[12:13:52 - 12:13:57]
okay so that looks good to me I'd

[12:13:55 - 12:13:59]
imagine it would also create the SQL

[12:13:57 - 12:14:01]
light and one

[12:13:59 - 12:14:02]
go I don't know if I have SQL light

[12:14:01 - 12:14:05]
installed on this computer well I guess

[12:14:02 - 12:14:07]
we'll find out here in just a moment so

[12:14:05 - 12:14:08]
I'm going to stop the app and I'll drag

[12:14:07 - 12:14:10]
this over a little bit we'll type in

[12:14:08 - 12:14:13]
esql

[12:14:10 - 12:14:18]
light we'll say where is let be clear

[12:14:13 - 12:14:19]
first where is SQL light 3 so it's

[12:14:18 - 12:14:21]
already installed I'd imagine if it

[12:14:19 - 12:14:24]
wasn't installed use pseudo snap install

[12:14:21 - 12:14:26]
SQL light 3 for your machine you'll just

[12:14:24 - 12:14:27]
have to figure it out if if it's not

[12:14:26 - 12:14:30]
installed I'm sure you can figure that

[12:14:27 - 12:14:32]
out um but we'll go ahead and try to run

[12:14:30 - 12:14:34]
this command so I have no idea if it's

[12:14:32 - 12:14:37]
going to work we have to run this in the

[12:14:34 - 12:14:39]
exact same repo otherwise it won't work

[12:14:37 - 12:14:41]
we'll go ahead and enter did it create a

[12:14:39 - 12:14:44]
links. DB

[12:14:41 - 12:14:46]
let's give this a refresh it did so if

[12:14:44 - 12:14:47]
we want to explore this file I'm going

[12:14:46 - 12:14:50]
to go over here and like look up for

[12:14:47 - 12:14:53]
like esql light fall explorer there's

[12:14:50 - 12:14:56]
probably one here

[12:14:53 - 12:14:58]
[Music]

[12:14:56 - 12:15:00]
somewhere going try this one here I

[12:14:58 - 12:15:01]
remember the first one the most popular

[12:15:00 - 12:15:04]
one did not work good for me and that's

[12:15:01 - 12:15:04]
why I'm trying a different

[12:15:05 - 12:15:09]
one I don't see it oh you know what

[12:15:08 - 12:15:11]
maybe we just click on the file and it

[12:15:09 - 12:15:13]
will work there we go

[12:15:11 - 12:15:14]
yeah yeah yeah okay so it is inserted

[12:15:13 - 12:15:16]
into the database that's perfect we're

[12:15:14 - 12:15:18]
going to go back over to here I'm going

[12:15:16 - 12:15:20]
to save this file I'm going to save this

[12:15:18 - 12:15:22]
file I'm going to go ahead and stop

[12:15:20 - 12:15:27]
this we'll type in

[12:15:22 - 12:15:28]
clear and we'll do run go go run main go

[12:15:27 - 12:15:31]
so what I'm hoping is that it's going to

[12:15:28 - 12:15:33]
load that data but it's kind of cool

[12:15:31 - 12:15:35]
because as we're slowly building this

[12:15:33 - 12:15:36]
we're learning how the code Works um

[12:15:35 - 12:15:38]
this is a different approach from that

[12:15:36 - 12:15:39]
app prototyping I feel like app

[12:15:38 - 12:15:41]
prototyping if you know your front ends

[12:15:39 - 12:15:42]
really well you you know you don't

[12:15:41 - 12:15:44]
really want to review that code as much

[12:15:42 - 12:15:46]
uh for backends I'd probably step

[12:15:44 - 12:15:48]
through all the stuff very slowly but

[12:15:46 - 12:15:50]
now that we have this running on Port Lo

[12:15:48 - 12:15:53]
Local Host um 8080 let's go ahead and

[12:15:50 - 12:15:55]
give this a refresh and there should be

[12:15:53 - 12:15:59]
no change here it should be the same

[12:15:55 - 12:16:01]
thing um did this

[12:15:59 - 12:16:03]
start oh I think it's still finding

[12:16:01 - 12:16:05]
finding the file so we actually have to

[12:16:03 - 12:16:07]
wait a little bit here it's not ready

[12:16:05 - 12:16:09]
yet all right after a short little wait

[12:16:07 - 12:16:11]
it seems like it is now serving let's go

[12:16:09 - 12:16:14]
over to here give it a nice hard refresh

[12:16:11 - 12:16:16]
um I think the data is the same it is

[12:16:14 - 12:16:18]
yep and we see that it's serving it so

[12:16:16 - 12:16:20]
it's definitely serving that just in

[12:16:18 - 12:16:22]
case uh we're not 100% certain I'm going

[12:16:20 - 12:16:25]
to go over to the database and make a

[12:16:22 - 12:16:27]
change as it should be serving uh the

[12:16:25 - 12:16:29]
data live so we go here I'm just going

[12:16:27 - 12:16:32]
to put an exclamation mark here if it

[12:16:29 - 12:16:35]
lets me do that I'm not sure if I can

[12:16:32 - 12:16:38]
edit it says read only

[12:16:35 - 12:16:39]
um is there a way I can edit it I

[12:16:38 - 12:16:41]
remember that was kind of the pain about

[12:16:39 - 12:16:43]
this uh these editors is that

[12:16:41 - 12:16:46]
they don't always let you edit the

[12:16:43 - 12:16:49]
text maybe I can just add another row

[12:16:46 - 12:16:49]
can I add another

[12:16:50 - 12:16:56]
row no so yeah I don't like that editor

[12:16:53 - 12:16:59]
I guess because I can't um do anything

[12:16:56 - 12:16:59]
with it I'll try this one

[12:17:00 - 12:17:03]
instead okay and I think they all work

[12:17:02 - 12:17:04]
the same way you click it and then you

[12:17:03 - 12:17:07]
get the

[12:17:04 - 12:17:12]
interface I mean this one looks the same

[12:17:07 - 12:17:12]
making me think that it didn't actually

[12:17:13 - 12:17:18]
it didn't actually oh can we change it

[12:17:15 - 12:17:21]
over here no no no no just just terrible

[12:17:18 - 12:17:22]
editors um so I'll go back over to here

[12:17:21 - 12:17:23]
I just want to make sure that it's

[12:17:22 - 12:17:25]
working and

[12:17:23 - 12:17:27]
so I want

[12:17:25 - 12:17:31]
[Music]

[12:17:27 - 12:17:31]
to just go down here and just make an

[12:17:31 - 12:17:36]
additional line here

[12:17:43 - 12:17:47]
this will be exam Pro Training

[12:18:03 - 12:18:07]
Inc and I'm going to go ahead and copy

[12:18:05 - 12:18:12]
this um I don't want to stop the server

[12:18:07 - 12:18:14]
because I want to see that it's uh

[12:18:12 - 12:18:15]
uh it work without us restarting it so

[12:18:14 - 12:18:18]
we'll just CD

[12:18:15 - 12:18:21]
into uh GitHub

[12:18:18 - 12:18:23]
co-pilot link tree I'm going to go ahead

[12:18:21 - 12:18:25]
and just paste this piece of code in

[12:18:23 - 12:18:27]
here hit enter and so that should be

[12:18:25 - 12:18:29]
inserted we'll give this a nice refresh

[12:18:27 - 12:18:31]
and so now it's serving it there so

[12:18:29 - 12:18:35]
there you go we can write go code

[12:18:31 - 12:18:36]
without knowing much about go um I'm

[12:18:35 - 12:18:40]
going to go ahead and just add a new

[12:18:36 - 12:18:42]
file here and call it dog ignore I want

[12:18:40 - 12:18:45]
to ignore a couple things the EnV and

[12:18:42 - 12:18:47]
also the links. DB as I do not feel like

[12:18:45 - 12:18:50]
committing those here

[12:18:47 - 12:18:54]
today

[12:18:50 - 12:18:54]
and yep that should be

[12:18:55 - 12:18:59]
good is there more you can do with co-

[12:18:57 - 12:19:02]
pallet absolutely but for the most part

[12:18:59 - 12:19:06]
it's pretty clear

[12:19:02 - 12:19:09]
um how that should work right so we'll

[12:19:06 - 12:19:14]
call that done and uh there you go

[12:19:09 - 12:19:16]
[Music]

[12:19:14 - 12:19:18]
all right so in this video I want to

[12:19:16 - 12:19:22]
take a look at Amazon Q developer we

[12:19:18 - 12:19:24]
built already a a simple API using go um

[12:19:22 - 12:19:25]
in copilot let's go take a look at what

[12:19:24 - 12:19:27]
that experiences like an Amazon Q

[12:19:25 - 12:19:29]
developer since we're building things

[12:19:27 - 12:19:31]
that are very simple I expect these to

[12:19:29 - 12:19:33]
perform pretty decently especially in

[12:19:31 - 12:19:35]
these smaller code examples it'd

[12:19:33 - 12:19:37]
probably be better to like test

[12:19:35 - 12:19:39]
infrastructure generation things like

[12:19:37 - 12:19:41]
that but you know it is what it is so I

[12:19:39 - 12:19:43]
already have the repo clone

[12:19:41 - 12:19:44]
from earlier so if you did the GitHub

[12:19:43 - 12:19:48]
co-pilot video then you're at the same

[12:19:44 - 12:19:51]
place as I am as well um so I I I cloned

[12:19:48 - 12:19:53]
the G gen Essentials repository and I'm

[12:19:51 - 12:19:57]
going to make a new folder here uh and

[12:19:53 - 12:19:59]
this is going to be called Amazon uh Q

[12:19:57 - 12:20:01]
developer and we're going to make a new

[12:19:59 - 12:20:03]
folder in here called link tree clone

[12:20:01 - 12:20:04]
because that is what we're going to do

[12:20:03 - 12:20:06]
we're going to do something very similar

[12:20:04 - 12:20:08]
to this one now I wonder if this one's

[12:20:06 - 12:20:09]
going to be much easier for it to do

[12:20:08 - 12:20:11]
because if it's in the same code base it

[12:20:09 - 12:20:13]
might pick up the stuff

[12:20:11 - 12:20:15]
right now I have GitHub co-pilot

[12:20:13 - 12:20:18]
activated so I'm going to have to go

[12:20:15 - 12:20:21]
turn that off okay we we can't have both

[12:20:18 - 12:20:23]
in here at the same time and I'm just

[12:20:21 - 12:20:25]
going to say disable for now and so

[12:20:23 - 12:20:28]
there's more than one it disables also

[12:20:25 - 12:20:30]
the chat as well I'm just going to say

[12:20:28 - 12:20:35]
we'll give this a nice refresh

[12:20:30 - 12:20:35]
here um I think it's

[12:20:35 - 12:20:40]
disabled yeah we'll reload the window

[12:20:42 - 12:20:46]
and we'll go ahead and we actually

[12:20:45 - 12:20:49]
already have q installed but all you

[12:20:46 - 12:20:52]
would do is search for Amazon q and

[12:20:49 - 12:20:57]
install it so I'll just uh reinstall

[12:20:52 - 12:20:57]
it okay nothing super

[12:20:57 - 12:21:01]
exciting not sure why I saying up Dev

[12:20:59 - 12:21:04]
containers I don't think that's

[12:21:01 - 12:21:08]
related no I don't think it is

[12:21:04 - 12:21:09]
um and so now I have Amazon que

[12:21:08 - 12:21:11]
installed notice down below we have the

[12:21:09 - 12:21:13]
little red thing so normally what we

[12:21:11 - 12:21:15]
need to do is go and log in so on the

[12:21:13 - 12:21:17]
left hand side we have the icon it

[12:21:15 - 12:21:18]
depends if you have a paid or free

[12:21:17 - 12:21:19]
version if you're on the free version

[12:21:18 - 12:21:21]
you're going to use your Builder ID and

[12:21:19 - 12:21:22]
that's what I'm using here today so I'm

[12:21:21 - 12:21:25]
going to go ahead and hit continue it's

[12:21:22 - 12:21:27]
going to authenticate me um it's going

[12:21:25 - 12:21:30]
to try to open the browser so let's

[12:21:27 - 12:21:32]
proceed to browser we're going to open

[12:21:30 - 12:21:34]
and here it's saying confirm that this

[12:21:32 - 12:21:38]
code matches the one given to

[12:21:34 - 12:21:40]
you um okay so it didn't take me to the

[12:21:38 - 12:21:42]
Builder ID if if you didn't have this

[12:21:40 - 12:21:45]
you might have a little bit of a

[12:21:42 - 12:21:47]
different process but databas Builder

[12:21:45 - 12:21:48]
ID is something that you'll want to

[12:21:47 - 12:21:51]
create first if I already have it's

[12:21:48 - 12:21:52]
going to keep logging me in here okay

[12:21:51 - 12:21:54]
yeah so you go here you create a new

[12:21:52 - 12:21:57]
Builder ID and that's how you'd be able

[12:21:54 - 12:21:59]
to work with this but I want to just go

[12:21:57 - 12:22:03]
confirm that this is the same number or

[12:21:59 - 12:22:05]
letter uh Ms yeah looks like the same so

[12:22:03 - 12:22:07]
we hit confirm it's interesting they

[12:22:05 - 12:22:08]
don't make you copy paste it that'd be

[12:22:07 - 12:22:11]
more secure but it looks like I do need

[12:22:08 - 12:22:13]
to log into my Builder ID so I thought

[12:22:11 - 12:22:15]
maybe I was already logged in uh but

[12:22:13 - 12:22:17]
apparently not so it says create a new

[12:22:15 - 12:22:18]
Builder ID I already have one so I'm

[12:22:17 - 12:22:20]
going to go down below I need to get

[12:22:18 - 12:22:22]
into my dash line so just give me a

[12:22:20 - 12:22:24]
moment here all right so I think I'm

[12:22:22 - 12:22:26]
ready to sign in and it didn't work so

[12:22:24 - 12:22:29]
just give me a second here to work

[12:22:26 - 12:22:30]
through this uh Stupid interface there

[12:22:29 - 12:22:33]
we go a second attempt with the Copa and

[12:22:30 - 12:22:35]
it looks like I'm getting access to it

[12:22:33 - 12:22:38]
um and you know we didn't hit any limits

[12:22:35 - 12:22:39]
with the GitHub co-pilot one um I'm not

[12:22:38 - 12:22:41]
I don't think we'll hit limits here

[12:22:39 - 12:22:43]
either with uh Amazon Q developer but

[12:22:41 - 12:22:44]
we'll find out as we're working with it

[12:22:43 - 12:22:47]
we're going to go ahead and hit sign in

[12:22:44 - 12:22:50]
I think we are signed in yeah we are

[12:22:47 - 12:22:52]
we'll just hit acknowledge here and so

[12:22:50 - 12:22:55]
let's start working with this so I'm

[12:22:52 - 12:22:58]
going to go over to here into this we'll

[12:22:55 - 12:22:58]
say main.go

[12:22:58 - 12:23:04]
okay and I remember like if I started

[12:23:02 - 12:23:05]
typing I mean it should autoc complete

[12:23:04 - 12:23:08]
I'm not sure why I'm not getting

[12:23:05 - 12:23:11]
autocomplete here today work on a task

[12:23:08 - 12:23:14]
using theed capabilities let's do a

[12:23:11 - 12:23:16]
explore okay so Implement features or

[12:23:14 - 12:23:19]
make changes across your workspace unit

[12:23:16 - 12:23:21]
test generation documentation generation

[12:23:19 - 12:23:23]
code reviews oh they've really done a

[12:23:21 - 12:23:25]
huge update to this thing upgrade

[12:23:23 - 12:23:28]
library and language versions of your

[12:23:25 - 12:23:32]
code base and these are all cool but I

[12:23:28 - 12:23:35]
just really want to um uh you know start

[12:23:32 - 12:23:36]
coding a goang app so I'm going to say I

[12:23:35 - 12:23:41]
want

[12:23:36 - 12:23:45]
to build a simple uh

[12:23:41 - 12:23:48]
go web app that is API only that is a

[12:23:45 - 12:23:50]
clone of Link

[12:23:48 - 12:23:52]
tree okay so let's go ahead and enter

[12:23:50 - 12:23:54]
that in see what we get definitely the

[12:23:52 - 12:23:56]
experience is feeling a lot better from

[12:23:54 - 12:23:59]
the last time I used it so we're getting

[12:23:56 - 12:24:01]
some code here um obviously the insert

[12:23:59 - 12:24:03]
insertation is not the same kind of

[12:24:01 - 12:24:05]
experience but that's totally fine so we

[12:24:03 - 12:24:06]
have some stuff here um we're getting

[12:24:05 - 12:24:08]
links and profile I like that it's

[12:24:06 - 12:24:11]
bringing in the profile oh I like that

[12:24:08 - 12:24:13]
it's breaking it down into functions

[12:24:11 - 12:24:16]
it's all a single file so that actually

[12:24:13 - 12:24:17]
looks pretty good to me codewise anyway

[12:24:16 - 12:24:20]
and so we'll go here and I'm going to go

[12:24:17 - 12:24:23]
ahead and insert at the cursor so we

[12:24:20 - 12:24:25]
have encoding Json log link profile

[12:24:23 - 12:24:28]
profile get profile update profile add

[12:24:25 - 12:24:30]
link it's really going all the way here

[12:24:28 - 12:24:32]
we even got routes now it's not that I

[12:24:30 - 12:24:34]
wouldn't have taken all this code from

[12:24:32 - 12:24:36]
GitHub co-pilot but it just gave me so

[12:24:34 - 12:24:38]
much that I didn't want to prompt it and

[12:24:36 - 12:24:40]
try to figure it out here clearly we are

[12:24:38 - 12:24:41]
initializing data that already exists

[12:24:40 - 12:24:43]
then down below we have some of our

[12:24:41 - 12:24:47]
instructions I'm going to go over to

[12:24:43 - 12:24:47]
here and we'll say readme.md

[12:24:48 - 12:24:52]
okay and I'm just going to go ahead and

[12:24:50 - 12:24:54]
split this screen like

[12:24:52 - 12:24:56]
this um I guess I didn't really need to

[12:24:54 - 12:24:57]
split it no I I did actually and so I

[12:24:56 - 12:25:00]
want to take some of the instructions it

[12:24:57 - 12:25:03]
has here so here it's suggesting that we

[12:25:00 - 12:25:05]
do a couple things

[12:25:03 - 12:25:09]
here

[12:25:05 - 12:25:11]
um so go mod and nit link tree cone so

[12:25:09 - 12:25:12]
this is to use this API need to install

[12:25:11 - 12:25:14]
gorilla MX

[12:25:12 - 12:25:17]
router okay but couldn't we specify that

[12:25:14 - 12:25:18]
in our file I mean this is one way of

[12:25:17 - 12:25:19]
doing which is totally fine I'm not sure

[12:25:18 - 12:25:22]
why the dev containers is running over

[12:25:19 - 12:25:24]
here I'm just going to ignore that um

[12:25:22 - 12:25:26]
and so I'm just going to CD into the

[12:25:24 - 12:25:28]
correct directory I'm not going to

[12:25:26 - 12:25:30]
follow the instructions exactly because

[12:25:28 - 12:25:31]
I kind of feel like it might be leading

[12:25:30 - 12:25:34]
me a little bit

[12:25:31 - 12:25:34]
astray like we will follow it but it'll

[12:25:34 - 12:25:37]
be a little bit different so I'm going

[12:25:34 - 12:25:39]
to CD into the link tree directory and

[12:25:37 - 12:25:40]
I'm not going to do this well I don't

[12:25:39 - 12:25:43]
know because if we did that it might set

[12:25:40 - 12:25:47]
us up with some good

[12:25:43 - 12:25:49]
stuff I don't know

[12:25:47 - 12:25:52]
um I mean we don't really have much code

[12:25:49 - 12:25:53]
in here okay you know what I'm just

[12:25:52 - 12:25:55]
going to follow its

[12:25:53 - 12:25:57]
instructions I'm going to go here I'm

[12:25:55 - 12:25:59]
going to delete this file

[12:25:57 - 12:26:02]
here because maybe it'll give us some

[12:25:59 - 12:26:04]
default files that we actually do want

[12:26:02 - 12:26:06]
and so I'll go back over to here I ended

[12:26:04 - 12:26:08]
up deleting the readme by accident but

[12:26:06 - 12:26:12]
we'll go ahead and we'll CD back a

[12:26:08 - 12:26:15]
directory and I'm going to go run

[12:26:12 - 12:26:19]
this okay and so let's see what it

[12:26:15 - 12:26:22]
created because what it might have done

[12:26:19 - 12:26:23]
okay so we are supposed to be in that

[12:26:22 - 12:26:26]
folder

[12:26:23 - 12:26:28]
okay but it did create the go mod file

[12:26:26 - 12:26:32]
okay so I did not have to delete any of

[12:26:28 - 12:26:32]
that so we'll go back here to link tree

[12:26:33 - 12:26:37]
clone and then we're going to go ahead

[12:26:35 - 12:26:41]
and make our readme.md

[12:26:37 - 12:26:44]
and I'm going to go back and make our

[12:26:41 - 12:26:44]
main.go

[12:26:44 - 12:26:47]
I think what we can do is also bring it

[12:26:46 - 12:26:49]
over here if we just want to have an

[12:26:47 - 12:26:51]
easier time working with it I've seen

[12:26:49 - 12:26:51]
some people do that what happened to my

[12:26:51 - 12:26:55]
chat

[12:26:51 - 12:26:56]
history no no no no no no no no no no

[12:26:55 - 12:26:59]
where did my chat history

[12:26:56 - 12:27:01]
go are you serious I move it and I lose

[12:26:59 - 12:27:02]
my chat history please tell me it's

[12:27:01 - 12:27:06]
still

[12:27:02 - 12:27:06]
here are you kidding

[12:27:06 - 12:27:13]
me one second what where does do chat

[12:27:10 - 12:27:13]
history

[12:27:14 - 12:27:18]
go Amazon Q

[12:27:20 - 12:27:25]
developer this so stupid it would be

[12:27:23 - 12:27:28]
great if Amazon Q retained history of

[12:27:25 - 12:27:29]
chats so if I came back another time it

[12:27:28 - 12:27:31]
yeah someone complained about this but

[12:27:29 - 12:27:33]
it's like how about the fact that if I

[12:27:31 - 12:27:34]
just move it from one side to the other

[12:27:33 - 12:27:36]
it

[12:27:34 - 12:27:40]
vanishes okay uh do you

[12:27:36 - 12:27:43]
recall the code you just gave me

[12:27:40 - 12:27:43]
for the go

[12:27:48 - 12:27:51]
app that's

[12:27:52 - 12:27:59]
frustrating let's see here the link tree

[12:27:56 - 12:27:59]
clod great give me all the

[12:28:01 - 12:28:09]
code CU I don't have it in the chat

[12:28:05 - 12:28:09]
history that is so stupid

[12:28:13 - 12:28:16]
I mean we can get it back so it's not

[12:28:15 - 12:28:18]
that bad

[12:28:16 - 12:28:21]
but like just me moving from here to

[12:28:18 - 12:28:21]
here that shouldn't

[12:28:22 - 12:28:28]
happen at least the code looks good

[12:28:25 - 12:28:28]
assuming it's not

[12:28:28 - 12:28:33]
hallucinating okay did that insert

[12:28:31 - 12:28:35]
it maybe because it's still generating

[12:28:33 - 12:28:37]
it was having a bit of a hard time so

[12:28:35 - 12:28:40]
I'm going to go here okay so that's

[12:28:37 - 12:28:41]
inserted it's going to use gorilla mck

[12:28:40 - 12:28:43]
which will give it more advanced routing

[12:28:41 - 12:28:45]
now Jin is a lot smaller but that's

[12:28:43 - 12:28:47]
totally fine I do like the structure of

[12:28:45 - 12:28:49]
all this so if this is true that this

[12:28:47 - 12:28:51]
looks really good we do have profile end

[12:28:49 - 12:28:53]
links um so we actually have create end

[12:28:51 - 12:28:55]
right here so that's good as well we are

[12:28:53 - 12:28:57]
going to have to CD

[12:28:55 - 12:29:01]
into um that directory again so we'll go

[12:28:57 - 12:29:03]
and just say link tree

[12:29:01 - 12:29:05]
clone and we'll initialize the mod so we

[12:29:03 - 12:29:07]
get that initial file and then that's

[12:29:05 - 12:29:09]
just going to add it to that you to be

[12:29:07 - 12:29:12]
honest it's probably a better way to add

[12:29:09 - 12:29:14]
it now I'm myself recalling these go

[12:29:12 - 12:29:16]
apps it's it's very

[12:29:14 - 12:29:20]
finicky to insert them into the mod file

[12:29:16 - 12:29:21]
here and so this is a lot nicer you can

[12:29:20 - 12:29:24]
test end points using curls oh cool it

[12:29:21 - 12:29:24]
gave us

[12:29:24 - 12:29:30]
curls so we'll go here and just say like

[12:29:27 - 12:29:34]
curl uh examples of curling

[12:29:30 - 12:29:36]
curls okay so we have this um I'll just

[12:29:34 - 12:29:40]
fix the indentation here or the the not

[12:29:36 - 12:29:42]
indentation the level of stuff here

[12:29:40 - 12:29:44]
probably don't need to do all that again

[12:29:42 - 12:29:46]
I'm not sure why I'm not getting autoc

[12:29:44 - 12:29:49]
completion um normally it would like say

[12:29:46 - 12:29:51]
things as I'm typing but that's totally

[12:29:49 - 12:29:54]
fine to be honest I actually don't like

[12:29:51 - 12:29:55]
it when it autocompletes so if it's

[12:29:54 - 12:29:57]
turned off by default that is an

[12:29:55 - 12:29:58]
improvement to me so we have some

[12:29:57 - 12:30:01]
examples here let's go ahead and try to

[12:29:58 - 12:30:02]
run the mango app because we're now

[12:30:01 - 12:30:05]
starting to get some experience with

[12:30:02 - 12:30:07]
mango there's a a complaint about this

[12:30:05 - 12:30:08]
at the top um we have package main so

[12:30:07 - 12:30:10]
that is

[12:30:08 - 12:30:11]
correct is this actually in the link Tre

[12:30:10 - 12:30:14]
directory it

[12:30:11 - 12:30:17]
is let's run that again what's the

[12:30:14 - 12:30:20]
problem expected package found end of

[12:30:17 - 12:30:22]
file Lane line one main one let's take

[12:30:20 - 12:30:23]
out this line here I'm not sure why it

[12:30:22 - 12:30:25]
has that maybe it's just a comment

[12:30:23 - 12:30:27]
because the first line has to be the

[12:30:25 - 12:30:30]
package or will complain and so here we

[12:30:27 - 12:30:32]
have uh Port 8,000 as instead of Port

[12:30:30 - 12:30:34]
80,000 880 which is totally fine it

[12:30:32 - 12:30:37]
doesn't really matter and so I'll bring

[12:30:34 - 12:30:39]
this on down here okay and we have 404

[12:30:37 - 12:30:40]
which is fine we're going to go ahead

[12:30:39 - 12:30:43]
and look at links here

[12:30:40 - 12:30:46]
here so we don't get anything there but

[12:30:43 - 12:30:48]
honestly like this API should really be

[12:30:46 - 12:30:49]
accessed via curl so if we can't access

[12:30:48 - 12:30:52]
it directly to the browser that's

[12:30:49 - 12:30:55]
totally fine let's go over to our read

[12:30:52 - 12:30:56]
me example and take a look and if we

[12:30:55 - 12:30:58]
curl I mean that should be sufficient

[12:30:56 - 12:31:00]
enough now to be fair we actually don't

[12:30:58 - 12:31:03]
have any data so if nothing was returned

[12:31:00 - 12:31:05]
that'd be fine here we are passing a

[12:31:03 - 12:31:08]
we're adding a link and then here we're

[12:31:05 - 12:31:11]
updating the profile we're getting the

[12:31:08 - 12:31:12]
profile um

[12:31:11 - 12:31:13]
I guess there's no listing links that

[12:31:12 - 12:31:16]
actually kind of makes sense we'll go

[12:31:13 - 12:31:20]
ahead and we'll just copy this curl

[12:31:16 - 12:31:23]
here we'll need another tab here I'll

[12:31:20 - 12:31:24]
stop this one this is from earlier so

[12:31:23 - 12:31:25]
I'm just going to it doesn't really

[12:31:24 - 12:31:27]
matter I just want to be in the same

[12:31:25 - 12:31:28]
directory but it doesn't matter if we're

[12:31:27 - 12:31:30]
in the same

[12:31:28 - 12:31:33]
directory right now so I'm going to hit

[12:31:30 - 12:31:35]
this curl and we do get data back okay

[12:31:33 - 12:31:38]
so this stuff is hardcoded right now if

[12:31:35 - 12:31:40]
we go back over to our main Go app we

[12:31:38 - 12:31:42]
can see that we've hardcoded it down

[12:31:40 - 12:31:44]
here now I wonder if we can rightclick

[12:31:42 - 12:31:46]
oh we do so we have Amazon Q just like

[12:31:44 - 12:31:48]
GitHub

[12:31:46 - 12:31:49]
copilot okay I like how we can generate

[12:31:48 - 12:31:52]
tests that's something that's really

[12:31:49 - 12:31:54]
important um but not necessarily

[12:31:52 - 12:31:56]
something I'm going to do this moment so

[12:31:54 - 12:31:59]
we have profile I guess the nice thing

[12:31:56 - 12:32:00]
about um go is like just the way it's so

[12:31:59 - 12:32:02]
statically declared you don't have to

[12:32:00 - 12:32:05]
write as much test code but anyway we

[12:32:02 - 12:32:07]
have a profile and so I really want this

[12:32:05 - 12:32:09]
profile to come

[12:32:07 - 12:32:13]
from a database so I'm going to right

[12:32:09 - 12:32:16]
click click here and I'm going to say

[12:32:13 - 12:32:21]
um inline

[12:32:16 - 12:32:25]
chat uh this code should pull from an

[12:32:21 - 12:32:28]
sqlite uh SQ 3 database okay so let's

[12:32:25 - 12:32:28]
see how it handles

[12:32:30 - 12:32:36]
that okay it's called in profile. DB

[12:32:32 - 12:32:41]
which is totally fine that is a lot of

[12:32:36 - 12:32:42]
code that is a bolt load of code

[12:32:41 - 12:32:45]
I wonder if it really needs that much

[12:32:42 - 12:32:45]
but it is doing quite a bit so we have

[12:32:45 - 12:32:50]
the

[12:32:45 - 12:32:52]
database okay um this is also in the

[12:32:50 - 12:32:55]
main

[12:32:52 - 12:32:57]
area I'm not sure if I like that because

[12:32:55 - 12:32:58]
it really should be getting the profile

[12:32:57 - 12:33:00]
over

[12:32:58 - 12:33:03]
here right so here we have the profile

[12:33:00 - 12:33:05]
which is being loaded over here and this

[12:33:03 - 12:33:07]
code is just like out the loose in the

[12:33:05 - 12:33:09]
main now that's not say the code is bad

[12:33:07 - 12:33:12]
I'm just saying like this is what we got

[12:33:09 - 12:33:15]
um I'm not

[12:33:12 - 12:33:18]
sure I'm not sure uh if this is accepted

[12:33:15 - 12:33:21]
still green how do we accept

[12:33:18 - 12:33:25]
it it doesn't

[12:33:21 - 12:33:27]
say okay it's still high oh here it is

[12:33:25 - 12:33:29]
accept enter sure we'll take it but this

[12:33:27 - 12:33:30]
code here is not going to work here so

[12:33:29 - 12:33:33]
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to

[12:33:30 - 12:33:37]
cut it out from

[12:33:33 - 12:33:39]
here and I'm going to bring this

[12:33:37 - 12:33:42]
into here because this is where we're

[12:33:39 - 12:33:45]
actually looking to get our data right

[12:33:42 - 12:33:48]
so we'll go ahead and paste it in

[12:33:45 - 12:33:50]
here and we are really just copying

[12:33:48 - 12:33:52]
pasting whatever right

[12:33:50 - 12:33:54]
now like we're on two spaces but it's

[12:33:52 - 12:33:55]
like forcing to four because the linter

[12:33:54 - 12:33:58]
is doing

[12:33:55 - 12:34:01]
it um so now we're expecting there to be

[12:33:58 - 12:34:04]
a profile. DB and things like that so

[12:34:01 - 12:34:09]
now I would probably say like

[12:34:04 - 12:34:11]
um for our profile. DB database can you

[12:34:09 - 12:34:14]
write me

[12:34:11 - 12:34:16]
um

[12:34:14 - 12:34:22]
uh code to

[12:34:16 - 12:34:27]
insert uh to create the

[12:34:22 - 12:34:31]
sqlite three table or database and see

[12:34:27 - 12:34:31]
data okay let's see if we can do

[12:34:37 - 12:34:41]
that okay so you know I just want I

[12:34:40 - 12:34:42]
don't want all this this is too much

[12:34:41 - 12:34:44]
this is too much it's not what I want no

[12:34:42 - 12:34:48]
no no

[12:34:44 - 12:34:52]
no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[12:34:48 - 12:34:55]
no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[12:34:52 - 12:34:58]
no no to to verify the data no this is

[12:34:55 - 12:35:02]
no this is no just give me a simple

[12:34:58 - 12:35:05]
command a simple uh command I can paste

[12:35:02 - 12:35:07]
into the

[12:35:05 - 12:35:09]
terminal that's way too much it's trying

[12:35:07 - 12:35:12]
to write code and that makes sense but

[12:35:09 - 12:35:13]
but I want command code there we go

[12:35:12 - 12:35:17]
that's a lot

[12:35:13 - 12:35:17]
better okay so I'm going to copy

[12:35:18 - 12:35:23]
this copy that and we're going to go

[12:35:20 - 12:35:23]
over to our read me

[12:35:25 - 12:35:28]
file create and

[12:35:28 - 12:35:33]
Seed esol

[12:35:31 - 12:35:36]
light

[12:35:33 - 12:35:41]
database

[12:35:36 - 12:35:41]
okay so I have something here um

[12:35:45 - 12:35:47]
it's a bit of a

[12:35:47 - 12:35:54]
mess can you format the uh the last line

[12:35:52 - 12:35:54]
so it's

[12:35:56 - 12:36:02]
multi-line because that's a bit of a

[12:35:59 - 12:36:04]
mess thank you that's yeah that's a lot

[12:36:02 - 12:36:06]
easier to read but so far it's it's

[12:36:04 - 12:36:07]
doing a lot more comprehensive coding so

[12:36:06 - 12:36:11]
that's

[12:36:07 - 12:36:11]
good going to copy that

[12:36:12 - 12:36:18]
paste that in um and so we'll go ahead

[12:36:14 - 12:36:18]
here and just say sh

[12:36:18 - 12:36:23]
sh so that's more of what I would like

[12:36:21 - 12:36:25]
to have now the Links aren't that great

[12:36:23 - 12:36:26]
but that's fine it's just generating out

[12:36:25 - 12:36:29]
nonsense links so I'm going to go ahead

[12:36:26 - 12:36:31]
and paste that down below and hit enter

[12:36:29 - 12:36:35]
and so now we should have in here if we

[12:36:31 - 12:36:36]
refresh a profile DB if I click here

[12:36:35 - 12:36:40]
it's not opening I'm surprised because

[12:36:36 - 12:36:43]
we did have an SQL light tool installed

[12:36:40 - 12:36:45]
earlier but I guess I'll go ahead and

[12:36:43 - 12:36:50]
see if it's installed again it is

[12:36:45 - 12:36:52]
installed so I'm not sure why it's not

[12:36:50 - 12:36:55]
uh taking that

[12:36:52 - 12:36:57]
there as we do have a viewer

[12:36:55 - 12:37:00]
installed so I'm going to install that

[12:36:57 - 12:37:04]
one I'm going to go back to this

[12:37:00 - 12:37:06]
one and yeah now I can see this

[12:37:04 - 12:37:07]
one okay so we have links and then we

[12:37:06 - 12:37:12]
have our profile so that's pretty good

[12:37:07 - 12:37:12]
so far I'm going to go back over to

[12:37:16 - 12:37:24]
here

[12:37:18 - 12:37:29]
and yeah so we have our database stuff

[12:37:24 - 12:37:30]
here we'll go back to our main.go and so

[12:37:29 - 12:37:32]
that's going to give us some data and so

[12:37:30 - 12:37:33]
this should be able to serve that up now

[12:37:32 - 12:37:35]
the only thing that I I wondering is

[12:37:33 - 12:37:37]
like we Dro this code in here is that

[12:37:35 - 12:37:40]
going to work that way should we open it

[12:37:37 - 12:37:41]
up every time we do request

[12:37:40 - 12:37:43]
uh it probably won't matter in our

[12:37:41 - 12:37:44]
smaller scope of our project here but

[12:37:43 - 12:37:46]
let's see if this code works it is a

[12:37:44 - 12:37:48]
little bit more

[12:37:46 - 12:37:49]
complex so we going to go down here to

[12:37:48 - 12:37:50]
our other one where we're running the

[12:37:49 - 12:37:53]
app I'm going to try to start it again

[12:37:50 - 12:37:54]
and see what happens undefined SQL light

[12:37:53 - 12:37:58]
um to be

[12:37:54 - 12:38:02]
fair we did not update the app to take

[12:37:58 - 12:38:05]
go in account so let's go up

[12:38:02 - 12:38:05]
here

[12:38:06 - 12:38:12]
and we have this here

[12:38:10 - 12:38:13]
there was something called go Imports

[12:38:12 - 12:38:16]
before that was trying to install let's

[12:38:13 - 12:38:16]
go find that go

[12:38:19 - 12:38:22]
Imports yeah see I don't know what it

[12:38:21 - 12:38:25]
was

[12:38:22 - 12:38:25]
now go

[12:38:27 - 12:38:31]
import what's

[12:38:32 - 12:38:37]
this no I don't care about that I just

[12:38:35 - 12:38:41]
wanted to find go

[12:38:37 - 12:38:41]
Imports nope that's just sort

[12:38:41 - 12:38:44]
I guess that's probably a big problem

[12:38:42 - 12:38:49]
for

[12:38:44 - 12:38:52]
uh folks there uh what's what's uh what

[12:38:49 - 12:38:57]
commands what do I what

[12:38:52 - 12:39:02]
command you to run to install the go

[12:38:57 - 12:39:02]
libraries for esite

[12:39:02 - 12:39:07]
three hopefully it understands in the

[12:39:04 - 12:39:10]
context of what we're talking

[12:39:07 - 12:39:12]
about so is that the same library that

[12:39:10 - 12:39:14]
we're using I'm not sure let's go back

[12:39:12 - 12:39:17]
and take a look

[12:39:14 - 12:39:20]
here um actually we don't have anything

[12:39:17 - 12:39:20]
anything imported for SQL right

[12:39:23 - 12:39:28]
now maybe I needed to take more of the

[12:39:25 - 12:39:31]
code and I just

[12:39:28 - 12:39:34]
didn't yeah so this one is using go go

[12:39:31 - 12:39:37]
light and log we'll just well hold on

[12:39:34 - 12:39:41]
here database SQL and then these

[12:39:37 - 12:39:41]
two really interesting how they are

[12:39:44 - 12:39:50]
listed well that's if

[12:39:47 - 12:39:52]
we that's for that

[12:39:50 - 12:39:55]
part I think it's because we generated

[12:39:52 - 12:39:55]
it in line and that's why it's

[12:39:58 - 12:40:04]
confusing anyway I'm going to go ahead

[12:40:00 - 12:40:04]
and paste this in here as

[12:40:04 - 12:40:09]
such so maybe SQL SQL is like the

[12:40:07 - 12:40:12]
generic uh the generic thing and then uh

[12:40:09 - 12:40:14]
we're using go SQL light 3 as our

[12:40:12 - 12:40:17]
adapter remember the other one we used

[12:40:14 - 12:40:20]
uh like um GM so maybe there could be

[12:40:17 - 12:40:22]
some similarities

[12:40:20 - 12:40:24]
there I don't like this whole

[12:40:22 - 12:40:27]
incompatible thing but we will see what

[12:40:24 - 12:40:29]
happens it's like plus incompatible but

[12:40:27 - 12:40:33]
we'll see all right so supposedly it's

[12:40:29 - 12:40:36]
installed and let's go

[12:40:33 - 12:40:40]
ahead and run this and see if it works

[12:40:36 - 12:40:44]
undefined SQL line 29

[12:40:40 - 12:40:47]
right here okay but we have SQL up

[12:40:44 - 12:40:47]
here what am I

[12:40:48 - 12:40:51]
missing there's a bunch of other stuff

[12:40:50 - 12:40:55]
here like tidy and stuff like that I

[12:40:51 - 12:40:55]
don't care about that

[12:40:55 - 12:41:00]
um okay so I'm going to go here and just

[12:40:58 - 12:41:01]
write this see if it can correct it for

[12:41:00 - 12:41:03]
us clearly there's something missing

[12:41:01 - 12:41:05]
maybe there's like an initialization or

[12:41:03 - 12:41:05]
something I'm not

[12:41:05 - 12:41:11]
sure you need to import the SQL package

[12:41:08 - 12:41:11]
let's go fix

[12:41:12 - 12:41:16]
that uhhuh is it not right

[12:41:17 - 12:41:22]
here it is

[12:41:20 - 12:41:24]
yeah the key Imports you're missing are

[12:41:22 - 12:41:27]
database SQL maybe I didn't save the

[12:41:24 - 12:41:30]
file let's just go ahead

[12:41:27 - 12:41:32]
there because it clearly is there right

[12:41:30 - 12:41:34]
and this is the standard SQL

[12:41:32 - 12:41:37]
interface says it's running I don't see

[12:41:34 - 12:41:40]
a failure yet we'll give it a moment

[12:41:37 - 12:41:41]
here I'm kind of expecting to see the

[12:41:40 - 12:41:44]
stuff that we saw in Jin but the thing

[12:41:41 - 12:41:46]
is Jin might have built-in logging and

[12:41:44 - 12:41:48]
so this one might not and so that

[12:41:46 - 12:41:50]
experience might be a little bit

[12:41:48 - 12:41:53]
different

[12:41:50 - 12:41:54]
um I think what we'll do is we'll go run

[12:41:53 - 12:41:56]
the bash command again so I'm going to

[12:41:54 - 12:41:58]
go over to our read me here and I'm

[12:41:56 - 12:42:02]
going to go ahead and copy this line

[12:41:58 - 12:42:02]
here and we'll paste it

[12:42:02 - 12:42:06]
in try this one more

[12:42:07 - 12:42:11]
time okay I'm just gonna try this again

[12:42:10 - 12:42:13]
it's giving me a little bit of trouble

[12:42:11 - 12:42:15]
copy and pasting here today I'm not sure

[12:42:13 - 12:42:18]
why we'll hit enter and we are getting

[12:42:15 - 12:42:20]
this data back and this is the data that

[12:42:18 - 12:42:22]
comes from the profile so this is

[12:42:20 - 12:42:24]
working as expected we could take this

[12:42:22 - 12:42:27]
further and we could finish it all up by

[12:42:24 - 12:42:29]
implementing all the other ones I'm not

[12:42:27 - 12:42:30]
sure if I really want to do that is that

[12:42:29 - 12:42:32]
could be timec

[12:42:30 - 12:42:35]
consuming uh we'll give it a try here

[12:42:32 - 12:42:36]
okay so like we'll go here oh edit with

[12:42:35 - 12:42:39]
control I that's cool it popped up

[12:42:36 - 12:42:41]
finally control I

[12:42:39 - 12:42:44]
control I not working as expected that's

[12:42:41 - 12:42:46]
fine it says contr I here but whatever

[12:42:44 - 12:42:51]
it's not really doing it um we'll say

[12:42:46 - 12:42:54]
okay uh hook uh change this code to work

[12:42:51 - 12:42:56]
with our sqlite database okay let's see

[12:42:54 - 12:43:00]
if we can do

[12:42:56 - 12:43:00]
that if that just works that'd be

[12:43:03 - 12:43:07]
awesome looks fine to

[12:43:07 - 12:43:14]
me okay okay I'm G to also just do this

[12:43:10 - 12:43:19]
one might as well just go for it

[12:43:14 - 12:43:22]
right change this code to work with

[12:43:19 - 12:43:22]
our escolite

[12:43:29 - 12:43:35]
database again looks okay to me at a

[12:43:33 - 12:43:36]
glance um this is the only one we didn't

[12:43:35 - 12:43:38]
do was update profile that one's a

[12:43:36 - 12:43:41]
little bit more involved let's just do

[12:43:38 - 12:43:41]
it let's go for

[12:43:41 - 12:43:48]
it change this code to work with our

[12:43:46 - 12:43:48]
sqol light

[12:44:01 - 12:44:06]
database okay oh if you're wondering if

[12:44:04 - 12:44:08]
you heard my phone there for a second I

[12:44:06 - 12:44:09]
had a video where I was watching about

[12:44:08 - 12:44:11]
Christmas lights and they were saying

[12:44:09 - 12:44:14]
there's a a person that's from Norway

[12:44:11 - 12:44:16]
that goes to Japan and they're saying as

[12:44:14 - 12:44:18]
a foreigner I'm so I'm so impressed at

[12:44:16 - 12:44:20]
like how good their Christmas lights are

[12:44:18 - 12:44:22]
if you're wondering what that audio was

[12:44:20 - 12:44:24]
totally not important but anyway now

[12:44:22 - 12:44:25]
that we've done that let's go ahead and

[12:44:24 - 12:44:28]
stop it and start it and if it just

[12:44:25 - 12:44:29]
works that'd be amazing um but generally

[12:44:28 - 12:44:32]
if we were working with this we would

[12:44:29 - 12:44:34]
check each one as we go the fact that it

[12:44:32 - 12:44:35]
can write test code is also sounds very

[12:44:34 - 12:44:37]
impressive to me so I'd be curious to

[12:44:35 - 12:44:39]
see that it's already started on Port

[12:44:37 - 12:44:40]
8,000 I'm just going to close out the

[12:44:39 - 12:44:42]
tab here on the side I know it's going

[12:44:40 - 12:44:44]
to make us lose our history but that's

[12:44:42 - 12:44:47]
just what we're going to have um we're

[12:44:44 - 12:44:50]
going to go over to here and so I would

[12:44:47 - 12:44:54]
like to add a new link I'm going to go

[12:44:50 - 12:44:55]
add exam Pro here exam Pro Training Inc

[12:44:54 - 12:44:58]
I'm not going to test them all I'm just

[12:44:55 - 12:44:58]
going to add the single one

[12:45:00 - 12:45:07]
here okay and we'll go ahead and copy

[12:45:03 - 12:45:10]
this and I'll paste it down below here

[12:45:07 - 12:45:12]
hit enter and now we'll go get our

[12:45:10 - 12:45:13]
profile and I want to see if that

[12:45:12 - 12:45:17]
appears in there

[12:45:13 - 12:45:17]
now do we have exam Pro in there do we

[12:45:17 - 12:45:20]
see

[12:45:17 - 12:45:24]
it

[12:45:20 - 12:45:24]
um I don't think we

[12:45:26 - 12:45:31]
do okay so let's type in clear again

[12:45:32 - 12:45:39]
here I don't see it let's go over to our

[12:45:35 - 12:45:39]
um database file here

[12:45:39 - 12:45:42]
yeah I don't see it inserted here so

[12:45:41 - 12:45:44]
clearly oh you know what I don't think

[12:45:42 - 12:45:45]
the file saved let's just stop that I I

[12:45:44 - 12:45:48]
don't I don't think that it's saved I

[12:45:45 - 12:45:50]
keep think I don't know why but I'm

[12:45:48 - 12:45:51]
failing to do the most basic thing which

[12:45:50 - 12:45:53]
is to save the

[12:45:51 - 12:45:57]
file so we do have a problem which is

[12:45:53 - 12:46:00]
result on line 101 so we'll go to 101

[12:45:57 - 12:46:04]
here

[12:46:00 - 12:46:07]
and it's saying result declared not

[12:46:04 - 12:46:10]
used fair enough it doesn't appear to be

[12:46:07 - 12:46:10]
used that that is correct

[12:46:11 - 12:46:15]
um and so it'll go

[12:46:12 - 12:46:15]
here

[12:46:16 - 12:46:21]
fix I like how I didn't get to tell what

[12:46:19 - 12:46:21]
the problem

[12:46:22 - 12:46:26]
was how does it know what it's

[12:46:29 - 12:46:33]
fixing remove the profile links array

[12:46:31 - 12:46:35]
since we're now using a database added a

[12:46:33 - 12:46:37]
proper error handling instead of log

[12:46:35 - 12:46:39]
fatal get autogenerate ID from the

[12:46:37 - 12:46:41]
database return just the nearly created

[12:46:39 - 12:46:43]
a link instead of all the links um added

[12:46:41 - 12:46:47]
a proper HTML status code I mean that

[12:46:43 - 12:46:49]
sounds all good so I don't know if it's

[12:46:47 - 12:46:50]
dealing with results still if we see

[12:46:49 - 12:46:53]
result

[12:46:50 - 12:46:56]
here yeah it does use it

[12:46:53 - 12:47:00]
now so I'd say I'm surprised the code

[12:46:56 - 12:47:01]
was not um good here but inser cursor so

[12:47:00 - 12:47:04]
I'm hoping that it just replaced the

[12:47:01 - 12:47:06]
existing one no it did not it Just

[12:47:04 - 12:47:09]
inserted it below it okay so I think

[12:47:06 - 12:47:10]
it's the top one's the old one

[12:47:09 - 12:47:13]
that's hard to say

[12:47:10 - 12:47:13]
now

[12:47:15 - 12:47:19]
um no I don't think it is so let's go

[12:47:17 - 12:47:22]
ahead here that looks like the old one

[12:47:19 - 12:47:24]
so let's go ahead and insert en

[12:47:22 - 12:47:27]
cursor oh maybe that okay maybe that was

[12:47:24 - 12:47:29]
all right I thought I thought it was uh

[12:47:27 - 12:47:30]
that let's go ahead and hit up we might

[12:47:29 - 12:47:32]
have to fix our other ones as well

[12:47:30 - 12:47:33]
because they might also be prone to the

[12:47:32 - 12:47:35]
same

[12:47:33 - 12:47:39]
issue it almost seems like you'd have to

[12:47:35 - 12:47:40]
run it and then tell it to fix each code

[12:47:39 - 12:47:42]
it's running so clearly there's no

[12:47:40 - 12:47:45]
problem so I'm going to go ahead here

[12:47:42 - 12:47:48]
first I'm just going to run our curl

[12:47:45 - 12:47:49]
with our profile and I'm going to hit up

[12:47:48 - 12:47:51]
until I get back to this one here hit

[12:47:49 - 12:47:53]
enter and now I'm just going to go

[12:47:51 - 12:47:56]
manually check the

[12:47:53 - 12:47:59]
database

[12:47:56 - 12:48:02]
um I mean I don't see it

[12:47:59 - 12:48:03]
inserted but this might not be refreshed

[12:48:02 - 12:48:05]
there it is okay so it is being inserted

[12:48:03 - 12:48:06]
excellent so I'm going to go back up to

[12:48:05 - 12:48:08]
here and hit enter and so now it's

[12:48:06 - 12:48:12]
inserting now could we correct the other

[12:48:08 - 12:48:14]
code probably do I care to correct it no

[12:48:12 - 12:48:17]
but um is the experience better than

[12:48:14 - 12:48:20]
GitHub co-pilot at least in this uh

[12:48:17 - 12:48:24]
comparison the code produced by Amazon

[12:48:20 - 12:48:26]
developer Q is much much better um the

[12:48:24 - 12:48:28]
only thing is that the ux experience is

[12:48:26 - 12:48:30]
the developer experience is not as nice

[12:48:28 - 12:48:31]
obviously the fact that I dragged this

[12:48:30 - 12:48:33]
over here and lost my chat history was

[12:48:31 - 12:48:37]
annoying but we were able to work around

[12:48:33 - 12:48:39]
it um and so yeah I would say I'm

[12:48:37 - 12:48:40]
surprised at that results here here but

[12:48:39 - 12:48:43]
you know these

[12:48:40 - 12:48:46]
things vary in terms of their quality so

[12:48:43 - 12:48:48]
we can't just always expect things to

[12:48:46 - 12:48:49]
work that great I'm going to go ahead

[12:48:48 - 12:48:51]
here I'm just going to make a new file

[12:48:49 - 12:48:53]
called Dog

[12:48:51 - 12:48:57]
ignore and we're just going to add the

[12:48:53 - 12:49:00]
profile. DB here okay and I'm going to

[12:48:57 - 12:49:03]
go ahead and refresh

[12:49:00 - 12:49:06]
this there we go we'll say Amazon Q

[12:49:03 - 12:49:09]
developer and surprisingly Amazon Q

[12:49:06 - 12:49:11]
developer was okay at coding okay but

[12:49:09 - 12:49:12]
anyway I will see you in the next one

[12:49:11 - 12:49:16]
all right

[12:49:12 - 12:49:18]
[Music]

[12:49:16 - 12:49:21]
ciao all right so in this video I wanted

[12:49:18 - 12:49:24]
to see if we can give uh Gemini Cod

[12:49:21 - 12:49:28]
assist a go um so this is kind of the

[12:49:24 - 12:49:30]
competitor to GitHub co-pilot Amazon

[12:49:28 - 12:49:33]
developer Q or Q developer I would

[12:49:30 - 12:49:37]
expect that this one here would work

[12:49:33 - 12:49:39]
better uh in go because go came from

[12:49:37 - 12:49:40]
Google I'm pretty certain so

[12:49:39 - 12:49:42]
who invented

[12:49:40 - 12:49:45]
go

[12:49:42 - 12:49:48]
goang and I could have

[12:49:45 - 12:49:50]
swore that Google has something to do

[12:49:48 - 12:49:52]
with it maybe they don't maybe it just

[12:49:50 - 12:49:53]
because it's called go I think that oh

[12:49:52 - 12:49:56]
it was designed at Google there you go

[12:49:53 - 12:49:59]
okay so I'm I'm not wrong here let's go

[12:49:56 - 12:50:00]
ahead and see if we can try it so so

[12:49:59 - 12:50:02]
Gemini code assistant Enterprise is

[12:50:00 - 12:50:05]
available for $90 a month per user for

[12:50:02 - 12:50:07]
$12 commitment uh this discount

[12:50:05 - 12:50:09]
describes how you can use Gemini code

[12:50:07 - 12:50:11]
assistant in Google Cloud to help do the

[12:50:09 - 12:50:12]
followings in vs code and things like

[12:50:11 - 12:50:15]
that okay great so how can I start

[12:50:12 - 12:50:17]
working with it um before testing code

[12:50:15 - 12:50:20]
Gemini assist capabilities your code you

[12:50:17 - 12:50:22]
must make sure etc etc I don't care

[12:50:20 - 12:50:24]
about that let's make our way over to vs

[12:50:22 - 12:50:26]
code and see what we can do it'd be

[12:50:24 - 12:50:28]
really annoying if I have to pay for it

[12:50:26 - 12:50:31]
but I wouldn't be surprised with Google

[12:50:28 - 12:50:34]
um to be honest this is the wrong

[12:50:31 - 12:50:36]
repository we have been working locally

[12:50:34 - 12:50:39]
this entire time and so we did GitHub

[12:50:36 - 12:50:42]
co-pilot and um

[12:50:39 - 12:50:46]
uh Amazon Q developer let's make our way

[12:50:42 - 12:50:50]
over here to here we'll type in code

[12:50:46 - 12:50:54]
assist is that what it's called Google

[12:50:50 - 12:50:57]
Cloud code and then we have Gemini code

[12:50:54 - 12:50:59]
assist so this is Gemini code assist

[12:50:57 - 12:51:01]
Plus Google Cloud code for visual studio

[12:50:59 - 12:51:04]
code bring the power of Google cloud and

[12:51:01 - 12:51:06]
Gemini to help build your apps faster

[12:51:04 - 12:51:08]
now that sounds good I just want to

[12:51:06 - 12:51:11]
write code right now I don't want to Loy

[12:51:08 - 12:51:14]
anything so I really just want

[12:51:11 - 12:51:16]
this so question is like will I have to

[12:51:14 - 12:51:18]
pay for this or does it have a free

[12:51:16 - 12:51:21]
tier and that's what I want to find out

[12:51:18 - 12:51:23]
so we'll go ahead and we'll install that

[12:51:21 - 12:51:25]
all right so um I have it installed now

[12:51:23 - 12:51:27]
the question is how do I use it now over

[12:51:25 - 12:51:29]
here on the left hand side I can see

[12:51:27 - 12:51:32]
Gemini code assist I probably should

[12:51:29 - 12:51:34]
disable I um Amazon Q before I proceed

[12:51:32 - 12:51:36]
here so we don't have conflicts so I'm

[12:51:34 - 12:51:39]
going to go here and just search for

[12:51:36 - 12:51:41]
Amazon Q

[12:51:39 - 12:51:43]
okay and I'm just going to disable for

[12:51:41 - 12:51:44]
now we'll reload the window so there's

[12:51:43 - 12:51:47]
no

[12:51:44 - 12:51:49]
confusion and the question will be will

[12:51:47 - 12:51:53]
I be able to use Gemini for free or will

[12:51:49 - 12:51:56]
I be hit with you got to pay for

[12:51:53 - 12:51:58]
it so log into Google Cloud sure we'll

[12:51:56 - 12:51:58]
go ahead and do

[12:52:00 - 12:52:04]
that Google Cloud's normally really easy

[12:52:02 - 12:52:06]
for us to get into so this should be not

[12:52:04 - 12:52:08]
too much of a

[12:52:06 - 12:52:10]
problem um okay so now I'm authorized

[12:52:08 - 12:52:11]
that sounds great I'm going to make my

[12:52:10 - 12:52:16]
way back

[12:52:11 - 12:52:18]
over to vs code here nope wrong repo

[12:52:16 - 12:52:21]
this one here and now it's talking about

[12:52:18 - 12:52:25]
making a project I don't want to connect

[12:52:21 - 12:52:27]
it to a project I simply want to uh code

[12:52:25 - 12:52:28]
on a project but that's totally fine

[12:52:27 - 12:52:30]
you're agreed to allow Google to enable

[12:52:28 - 12:52:32]
the API required yeah sure we so select

[12:52:30 - 12:52:34]
a project and I actually have one called

[12:52:32 - 12:52:36]
gen Essentials I can't remember what we

[12:52:34 - 12:52:38]
did in there but we set it up earlier

[12:52:36 - 12:52:40]
and I'm just saying enable API of course

[12:52:38 - 12:52:42]
if you don't have one you'd have to then

[12:52:40 - 12:52:44]
go do something here on and after

[12:52:42 - 12:52:45]
January 27th access Gemini Cod system

[12:52:44 - 12:52:48]
will require an active subscription with

[12:52:45 - 12:52:50]
an assigned license so I'm not sure if

[12:52:48 - 12:52:52]
that's a trial based on the time period

[12:52:50 - 12:52:54]
that I'm in right now or if that's just

[12:52:52 - 12:52:56]
going to be when they start doing it so

[12:52:54 - 12:52:59]
if this is the future and you can't do

[12:52:56 - 12:53:01]
that well sorry just watch the video and

[12:52:59 - 12:53:03]
get an idea of what this thing can do so

[12:53:01 - 12:53:04]
now we have it open let's see what we

[12:53:03 - 12:53:07]
can uh start doing so I'm going to make

[12:53:04 - 12:53:11]
a new folder here it's going to be uh

[12:53:07 - 12:53:13]
Gemini CODIS Gemini code assist and I'm

[12:53:11 - 12:53:15]
going to make a new folder here called

[12:53:13 - 12:53:17]
link tree

[12:53:15 - 12:53:19]
clone and I'm going to make a new file

[12:53:17 - 12:53:21]
here called main.go and we're getting

[12:53:19 - 12:53:24]
pretty good at here now already the

[12:53:21 - 12:53:26]
experience is better right it's already

[12:53:24 - 12:53:28]
showing me control I which I like so if

[12:53:26 - 12:53:31]
I go ahead and hit control I that's not

[12:53:28 - 12:53:34]
working if I try alt ey windows I none

[12:53:31 - 12:53:35]
of them work none of them work so it

[12:53:34 - 12:53:39]
could be that there's something just

[12:53:35 - 12:53:42]
wrong with um my hotkey here but for

[12:53:39 - 12:53:43]
whatever reason I can't seem to do hocky

[12:53:42 - 12:53:45]
that's totally fine because I'm going to

[12:53:43 - 12:53:49]
drag not g pod we're going to drag in

[12:53:45 - 12:53:51]
GitHub or Gemini uh Gemini code assist

[12:53:49 - 12:53:53]
over here it says open a file get code

[12:53:51 - 12:53:55]
suggestions as you type and hit

[12:53:53 - 12:54:00]
tab um so I just want to start here so

[12:53:55 - 12:54:01]
I'm like I am I want to build a

[12:54:00 - 12:54:06]
simple

[12:54:01 - 12:54:10]
go web app that is apid driven um that

[12:54:06 - 12:54:13]
is a clone of link

[12:54:10 - 12:54:17]
tree let's see how it can

[12:54:13 - 12:54:17]
do and so we'll give it a moment here to

[12:54:17 - 12:54:22]
generate okay not the fastest but let's

[12:54:20 - 12:54:25]
just see how good the code is we are

[12:54:22 - 12:54:27]
also using the I guess trial version so

[12:54:25 - 12:54:28]
maybe yeah it says yeah maybe it'll be

[12:54:27 - 12:54:32]
different here so we have a bunch of

[12:54:28 - 12:54:34]
output which is fine okay where's the

[12:54:32 - 12:54:39]
code this is the go implementation that

[12:54:34 - 12:54:39]
you'll use okay where's where's the code

[12:54:40 - 12:54:43]
give me code

[12:54:50 - 12:54:55]
please I definitely use the control I if

[12:54:53 - 12:54:59]
the control I worked maybe it's control

[12:54:55 - 12:55:00]
shift I nope still doesn't work so we're

[12:54:59 - 12:55:06]
not getting any

[12:55:00 - 12:55:06]
code okay so so far that's not good um

[12:55:08 - 12:55:13]
well okay I'm going to open up the

[12:55:09 - 12:55:16]
command pallet we'll try uh assist

[12:55:13 - 12:55:16]
here

[12:55:17 - 12:55:22]
and this says control enter let's try

[12:55:20 - 12:55:25]
control enter what we get

[12:55:22 - 12:55:25]
there

[12:55:26 - 12:55:30]
nope oh I was so excited for this to

[12:55:28 - 12:55:34]
work

[12:55:30 - 12:55:34]
well code

[12:55:34 - 12:55:39]
assist generate

[12:55:36 - 12:55:42]
code okay so I not sure why control I

[12:55:39 - 12:55:43]
control I control I contr I it just

[12:55:42 - 12:55:46]
doesn't

[12:55:43 - 12:55:49]
work so let's go to our settings here I

[12:55:46 - 12:55:51]
suppose maybe something's overriding it

[12:55:49 - 12:55:51]
hot

[12:55:54 - 12:56:00]
Keys okay why is my control I in PS code

[12:55:59 - 12:56:03]
not working because maybe something's

[12:56:00 - 12:56:03]
like overriding

[12:56:05 - 12:56:10]
it toggle keyboard shortcuts trouble

[12:56:08 - 12:56:13]
shooting okay so I'm going to go over to

[12:56:10 - 12:56:13]
here

[12:56:14 - 12:56:20]
developer nope try this

[12:56:17 - 12:56:23]
again

[12:56:20 - 12:56:26]
developer

[12:56:23 - 12:56:26]
toggle shortcuts

[12:56:28 - 12:56:33]
troubleshooting okay what did that do

[12:56:30 - 12:56:33]
nothing

[12:56:39 - 12:56:42]
I'm not sure what that was supposed to

[12:56:40 - 12:56:45]
do but that's what the internet told me

[12:56:42 - 12:56:46]
to do so that wasn't very helpful um so

[12:56:45 - 12:56:48]
it's kind of hard because like if I

[12:56:46 - 12:56:51]
can't do the control I how am I going to

[12:56:48 - 12:56:51]
do

[12:56:51 - 12:56:55]
this all right so what I'm going to do I

[12:56:53 - 12:56:57]
guess oh here it is ignoring single

[12:56:55 - 12:56:59]
modifier control due it to being pressed

[12:56:57 - 12:56:59]
with other

[12:56:59 - 12:57:03]
Keys oh it is actually outputting stuff

[12:57:02 - 12:57:06]
below

[12:57:03 - 12:57:07]
okay extension Vim control I okay so

[12:57:06 - 12:57:10]
maybe it's Vim that's overriding it let

[12:57:07 - 12:57:12]
me go ahead and just disable

[12:57:10 - 12:57:15]
them and we'll go ahead here and just

[12:57:12 - 12:57:18]
say disable and I'm going to refresh the

[12:57:15 - 12:57:18]
or re reload the work

[12:57:21 - 12:57:26]
window I mean that's unfortunate that if

[12:57:23 - 12:57:29]
I can't use Vim with it

[12:57:26 - 12:57:31]
um I don't want to do an update just now

[12:57:29 - 12:57:34]
we're giving this a moment for Gemini

[12:57:31 - 12:57:34]
sis to reappear

[12:57:36 - 12:57:40]
here oh open a file get code suggestions

[12:57:39 - 12:57:42]
as you

[12:57:40 - 12:57:45]
type

[12:57:42 - 12:57:47]
okay so we'll do control I here now okay

[12:57:45 - 12:57:50]
so now we got something so do I want to

[12:57:47 - 12:57:53]
generate code absolutely I want to

[12:57:50 - 12:57:56]
generate out uh code so

[12:57:53 - 12:58:02]
um build a

[12:57:56 - 12:58:05]
simple go Lang web app that is API

[12:58:02 - 12:58:09]
driven which is

[12:58:05 - 12:58:11]
a link tree alone okay let's see if we

[12:58:09 - 12:58:11]
can do

[12:58:12 - 12:58:18]
that the code was fast we have htttp so

[12:58:16 - 12:58:23]
it's deciding to do everything PL

[12:58:18 - 12:58:27]
Jane and I mean we did say simple so

[12:58:23 - 12:58:29]
technically it's correct right it it did

[12:58:27 - 12:58:32]
the most simplest uh thing it can do it

[12:58:29 - 12:58:35]
didn't use Jin it didn't use gorilla um

[12:58:32 - 12:58:38]
I liked the gorilla code but it was

[12:58:35 - 12:58:40]
doing exactly what we told it to do so I

[12:58:38 - 12:58:43]
mean that's good okay so I'm going to go

[12:58:40 - 12:58:48]
over here like how do

[12:58:43 - 12:58:50]
I um I have my app code but how do I run

[12:58:48 - 12:58:53]
it okay so that's what I'm going to ask

[12:58:50 - 12:58:55]
it ask it to do like it literally it's

[12:58:53 - 12:58:57]
using all built-in libraries which is

[12:58:55 - 12:58:59]
really impressive as

[12:58:57 - 12:59:01]
well I'm not sure why this is so slow

[12:58:59 - 12:59:03]
the code here was instant but this is

[12:59:01 - 12:59:03]
incredibly

[12:59:04 - 12:59:08]
slow oh you can click that to get that

[12:59:06 - 12:59:11]
to that as well okay

[12:59:08 - 12:59:14]
[Music]

[12:59:11 - 12:59:16]
um okay so talking about running in in a

[12:59:14 - 12:59:18]
Docker container I suppose that's a way

[12:59:16 - 12:59:20]
that we could do it and I guess if this

[12:59:18 - 12:59:23]
thing is focused with g-cloud

[12:59:20 - 12:59:25]
then that kind of make sense so here it

[12:59:23 - 12:59:25]
says for local

[12:59:27 - 12:59:32]
development is go build and then running

[12:59:29 - 12:59:34]
it that way so I would say the output's

[12:59:32 - 12:59:36]
not good I like that it's bringing in

[12:59:34 - 12:59:39]
Google Cloud

[12:59:36 - 12:59:42]
stuff um but I didn't ask for that in

[12:59:39 - 12:59:44]
particular so though I was pretty vague

[12:59:42 - 12:59:46]
in terms of how I was describing stuff

[12:59:44 - 12:59:49]
um so I'm going to go over to here to

[12:59:46 - 12:59:52]
terminal and we'll just CD into the

[12:59:49 - 12:59:52]
Gemini one

[12:59:53 - 12:59:59]
here I get CD back

[12:59:56 - 13:00:01]
here and so this is going to be well we

[12:59:59 - 13:00:04]
have main.go but we don't have our other

[13:00:01 - 13:00:08]
files but we don't really need any other

[13:00:04 - 13:00:09]
modules so I don't think that matters

[13:00:08 - 13:00:12]
um what was the line that we have to run

[13:00:09 - 13:00:16]
it's like go main go or something go run

[13:00:12 - 13:00:18]
maybe it's like G run main.go well we

[13:00:16 - 13:00:21]
have to CD into link tree first so we

[13:00:18 - 13:00:23]
say G run main.go and so that should

[13:00:21 - 13:00:25]
start up the app and it did start it it

[13:00:23 - 13:00:28]
was super fast because it's using all

[13:00:25 - 13:00:28]
built-in

[13:00:28 - 13:00:34]
libraries we have a 404 which is totally

[13:00:30 - 13:00:36]
fine um it depends on where this is

[13:00:34 - 13:00:40]
started so if we scroll on down here we

[13:00:36 - 13:00:42]
have for SL links and for add so we go

[13:00:40 - 13:00:45]
here was just say

[13:00:42 - 13:00:47]
links and we get null back because

[13:00:45 - 13:00:50]
there's no data right if we go up to

[13:00:47 - 13:00:53]
here we don't even have

[13:00:50 - 13:00:55]
um any kind of data being

[13:00:53 - 13:00:58]
inserted which is fine I'm going to go

[13:00:55 - 13:01:03]
here and just say generate so we'll say

[13:00:58 - 13:01:08]
generate and I'll I'll just say um the

[13:01:03 - 13:01:08]
app should use SQL light 3

[13:01:09 - 13:01:15]
um okay so hopefully that's

[13:01:13 - 13:01:18]
enough so now it's bring in the go SQL

[13:01:15 - 13:01:20]
light and now the database SQL which is

[13:01:18 - 13:01:23]
fine it has the initialization function

[13:01:20 - 13:01:25]
to initialize it I don't really want it

[13:01:23 - 13:01:28]
to initialize in

[13:01:25 - 13:01:31]
here but I suppose that's

[13:01:28 - 13:01:33]
fine add link

[13:01:31 - 13:01:36]
Handler yeah I like I don't really want

[13:01:33 - 13:01:37]
that code in here um so I don't think I

[13:01:36 - 13:01:39]
take that code I'm can decline that I

[13:01:37 - 13:01:41]
don't like that so I'm going to try this

[13:01:39 - 13:01:47]
again

[13:01:41 - 13:01:49]
say I want to use SQL light 3 to read

[13:01:47 - 13:01:54]
the

[13:01:49 - 13:01:57]
um to read um data from the

[13:01:54 - 13:02:03]
database for links and

[13:01:57 - 13:02:03]
adding links I don't want to initialize

[13:02:07 - 13:02:14]
the database in this

[13:02:11 - 13:02:14]
file

[13:02:15 - 13:02:21]
okay now the other thing I don't like is

[13:02:17 - 13:02:23]
that this is very specific to um a

[13:02:21 - 13:02:24]
single file and where the other ones

[13:02:23 - 13:02:26]
they seem to be a bit more bit more

[13:02:24 - 13:02:28]
intelligent we have that go Imports

[13:02:26 - 13:02:30]
again I can install it this time because

[13:02:28 - 13:02:32]
if it can bring in the Imports manually

[13:02:30 - 13:02:34]
I would love that but it complained here

[13:02:32 - 13:02:37]
so that's no good um okay so I'll just

[13:02:34 - 13:02:39]
accept this do I like this I don't know

[13:02:37 - 13:02:41]
we have a double Imports here normally

[13:02:39 - 13:02:44]
there just be one

[13:02:41 - 13:02:47]
so that's not oh I don't have Vim I had

[13:02:44 - 13:02:48]
to turn Vim off to use this thing now to

[13:02:47 - 13:02:50]
be fair I would have had to turn off on

[13:02:48 - 13:02:51]
the other ones I just didn't have a

[13:02:50 - 13:02:54]
thing so here it says create table if it

[13:02:51 - 13:02:56]
does not exist I told it not to do that

[13:02:54 - 13:03:00]
I told it not to do that and it still

[13:02:56 - 13:03:03]
did that anyway um but it does have the

[13:03:00 - 13:03:05]
select from URL links the code looks

[13:03:03 - 13:03:08]
okay I'm not sure why we're getting

[13:03:05 - 13:03:08]
problems over here

[13:03:10 - 13:03:12]
okay

[13:03:15 - 13:03:19]
um I guess it sourced it from here so

[13:03:18 - 13:03:22]
it's saying I grab this code from here

[13:03:19 - 13:03:24]
and just understand that this is where I

[13:03:22 - 13:03:26]
grabbed it from okay that's fair um I've

[13:03:24 - 13:03:27]
never seen one do that so that's

[13:03:26 - 13:03:30]
interesting if you're concerned about

[13:03:27 - 13:03:30]
where it's getting code

[13:03:31 - 13:03:35]
from okay so that that looks fine the

[13:03:34 - 13:03:40]
only thing is that we don't have a

[13:03:35 - 13:03:46]
database so I'm going to go and ask

[13:03:40 - 13:03:47]
like can I get uh a command that will

[13:03:46 - 13:03:54]
create and

[13:03:47 - 13:03:57]
Seed the links DB data can it be

[13:03:54 - 13:04:02]
uh any bash

[13:03:57 - 13:04:02]
command okay let's see what we get here

[13:04:10 - 13:04:17]
no that's not what I

[13:04:13 - 13:04:17]
asked I need some seed

[13:04:19 - 13:04:23]
data so the thing is like this thing

[13:04:21 - 13:04:27]
might be more optimized for Google Cloud

[13:04:23 - 13:04:29]
as opposed to writing out code uh which

[13:04:27 - 13:04:32]
we're not really doing right now so it

[13:04:29 - 13:04:34]
may not be fair of an example here we do

[13:04:32 - 13:04:39]
get um a file here so I'm going to go

[13:04:34 - 13:04:41]
ahead and just call this links. SQL

[13:04:39 - 13:04:41]
and I'm just going

[13:04:41 - 13:04:48]
to that was kind of

[13:04:44 - 13:04:51]
interesting okay insert that there

[13:04:48 - 13:04:53]
um and then we will do

[13:04:51 - 13:04:57]
this so I'll just bring terminal up here

[13:04:53 - 13:04:59]
for a second I'll go to my other tab oh

[13:04:57 - 13:05:01]
I'm running both this is link

[13:04:59 - 13:05:03]
tree this is Amazon developer Q I'm just

[13:05:01 - 13:05:07]
going to CD into the correct directory

[13:05:03 - 13:05:08]
here Gemini code assist and we'll paste

[13:05:07 - 13:05:11]
it in here

[13:05:08 - 13:05:15]
um I didn't call it C data I hold it

[13:05:11 - 13:05:18]
links so we'll just change that out like

[13:05:15 - 13:05:20]
this enter no such file or directory are

[13:05:18 - 13:05:22]
you sure uh oh you know we're not in the

[13:05:20 - 13:05:25]
right directory that's

[13:05:22 - 13:05:26]
why no such file or table called links I

[13:05:25 - 13:05:30]
was hoping that it would create the

[13:05:26 - 13:05:31]
table as it would do that it didn't um

[13:05:30 - 13:05:33]
it would create the table if we ran the

[13:05:31 - 13:05:34]
app first so I'm going to go stop it and

[13:05:33 - 13:05:36]
then run the app and that way it'll just

[13:05:34 - 13:05:38]
create the the thing that we need it

[13:05:36 - 13:05:39]
doesn't have the ghost light anything

[13:05:38 - 13:05:42]
here so I'm going to go ahead and just

[13:05:39 - 13:05:44]
paste this in here and what I wanted to

[13:05:42 - 13:05:46]
do is to give me that line to install it

[13:05:44 - 13:05:49]
as we have done that prior in another

[13:05:46 - 13:05:51]
video this is the line I wanted this is

[13:05:49 - 13:05:52]
correct I like how it has terminal here

[13:05:51 - 13:05:55]
and I hit run and it ran it in place or

[13:05:52 - 13:05:56]
pasted it in place that's nice because

[13:05:55 - 13:05:57]
sometimes you copy paste and it's

[13:05:56 - 13:06:00]
annoying especially on

[13:05:57 - 13:06:04]
windows so it should install it and set

[13:06:00 - 13:06:06]
up the main doso or whatever it's

[13:06:04 - 13:06:08]
called is that what it's called the

[13:06:06 - 13:06:12]
other one

[13:06:08 - 13:06:17]
main dot or um go dot

[13:06:12 - 13:06:17]
mod is really hanging here I'm not sure

[13:06:23 - 13:06:27]
why because before we

[13:06:27 - 13:06:31]
initialized right so I think the reason

[13:06:29 - 13:06:34]
it's hanging is that it needs to

[13:06:31 - 13:06:34]
initialize

[13:06:34 - 13:06:43]
um here so I'm just wondering what that

[13:06:38 - 13:06:46]
I don't have a go. file how do I

[13:06:43 - 13:06:46]
initialize

[13:06:46 - 13:06:50]
one okay so I'm G to stop this this

[13:06:48 - 13:06:52]
isn't doing

[13:06:50 - 13:06:54]
anything like this Line's fine but if

[13:06:52 - 13:06:55]
you don't have the mod. go file it's not

[13:06:54 - 13:07:00]
going to

[13:06:55 - 13:07:03]
work here it is go mod

[13:07:00 - 13:07:05]
initialize now hit up and notice it

[13:07:03 - 13:07:06]
worked instantly right so it was

[13:07:05 - 13:07:08]
definitely missing that let's go back

[13:07:06 - 13:07:09]
and try to build now

[13:07:08 - 13:07:12]
um is it running over here no so we'll

[13:07:09 - 13:07:15]
go here

[13:07:12 - 13:07:18]
and run this here unexpected type name

[13:07:15 - 13:07:20]
line 69 we'll go over to line 69 we'll

[13:07:18 - 13:07:22]
take a look and see what the problem is

[13:07:20 - 13:07:24]
we can already see that there's a

[13:07:22 - 13:07:27]
highlighting issue right here and it

[13:07:24 - 13:07:27]
looks like some code is

[13:07:27 - 13:07:37]
missing it looks like we have double

[13:07:30 - 13:07:37]
code okay so I don't think I did that um

[13:07:38 - 13:07:42]
do we have ad link yeah we have ad link

[13:07:40 - 13:07:44]
Handler twice so this looks like the old

[13:07:42 - 13:07:46]
code here I'm going to go down to here

[13:07:44 - 13:07:49]
and just do

[13:07:46 - 13:07:53]
this and that's kind of like my

[13:07:49 - 13:07:53]
fixed links Link

[13:07:57 - 13:08:01]
Link maybe I deleted out some of the

[13:07:59 - 13:08:02]
code that's necessary we have ADD get

[13:08:01 - 13:08:07]
link

[13:08:02 - 13:08:07]
handler do we need

[13:08:07 - 13:08:10]
we need this

[13:08:12 - 13:08:16]
right okay I just undid and I don't have

[13:08:15 - 13:08:17]
that double code anymore okay I'll just

[13:08:16 - 13:08:20]
hit

[13:08:17 - 13:08:23]
up is redeclared in this block okay so

[13:08:20 - 13:08:26]
this being declared

[13:08:23 - 13:08:29]
twice add link Handler and then add link

[13:08:26 - 13:08:30]
Handler um this is the one I don't think

[13:08:29 - 13:08:34]
I

[13:08:30 - 13:08:34]
wanted that's get links

[13:08:34 - 13:08:37]
Handler and then there's another one

[13:08:36 - 13:08:41]
right here so these ones look a lot

[13:08:37 - 13:08:41]
smaller so I'm going to take those ones

[13:08:42 - 13:08:47]
out what a mess we'll try this

[13:08:47 - 13:08:52]
again port

[13:08:50 - 13:08:55]
8080 um sure we'll open the

[13:08:52 - 13:08:59]
browser we have over

[13:08:55 - 13:09:00]
here let's try links the I'm doing this

[13:08:59 - 13:09:03]
so that creates the

[13:09:00 - 13:09:06]
table it never created the

[13:09:03 - 13:09:08]
table so could I get this working

[13:09:06 - 13:09:10]
absolutely do I want to get this working

[13:09:08 - 13:09:12]
no this is kind of a frustrating

[13:09:10 - 13:09:16]
experience at this time I would probably

[13:09:12 - 13:09:21]
not recommend at least for coding wise

[13:09:16 - 13:09:23]
um Google Google um Google's or Gemini's

[13:09:21 - 13:09:26]
code assist it could be really good at

[13:09:23 - 13:09:28]
generating out um Google Cloud code

[13:09:26 - 13:09:32]
infrastructure that's not what we're

[13:09:28 - 13:09:33]
testing it for here um so I might be

[13:09:32 - 13:09:36]
misrepresenting it here because it's not

[13:09:33 - 13:09:37]
necessarily performant on coding task

[13:09:36 - 13:09:38]
but this is a bit of a headache to get

[13:09:37 - 13:09:42]
working and I don't even want to try it

[13:09:38 - 13:09:45]
any further um so just say Gemini code

[13:09:42 - 13:09:47]
assist and we'll call that good enough

[13:09:45 - 13:09:49]
for now and if nobody likes what I did

[13:09:47 - 13:09:51]
there well

[13:09:49 - 13:09:52]
whatever I'm doing the best I can here I

[13:09:51 - 13:09:53]
don't want to waste too much time on

[13:09:52 - 13:09:56]
this if we can't get it working in a

[13:09:53 - 13:09:59]
state that we want but there you

[13:09:56 - 13:10:01]
[Music]

[13:09:59 - 13:10:04]
go hey this is Angie Brown we are going

[13:10:01 - 13:10:07]
to be taking a look at codium wind surf

[13:10:04 - 13:10:11]
editor now codium uh is a extension that

[13:10:07 - 13:10:13]
works just like GitHub um co-pilot or

[13:10:11 - 13:10:16]
Amazon developer q but apparently they

[13:10:13 - 13:10:17]
now have a full-blown editor you can

[13:10:16 - 13:10:20]
also do the codium extension but I'd

[13:10:17 - 13:10:22]
rather go for wind surf here today um

[13:10:20 - 13:10:25]
and let's go download and give it a go

[13:10:22 - 13:10:27]
and see if we can build our little goang

[13:10:25 - 13:10:29]
app in their interface and get an idea

[13:10:27 - 13:10:31]
of how the experience is different I

[13:10:29 - 13:10:33]
guess codium is now kind of moving to

[13:10:31 - 13:10:36]
the space of what cursor does I really

[13:10:33 - 13:10:37]
like the idea of how codium has built

[13:10:36 - 13:10:38]
their infrastructure they have a really

[13:10:37 - 13:10:40]
good video online on how they

[13:10:38 - 13:10:43]
implemented that but let's go ahead and

[13:10:40 - 13:10:45]
get this installed and once that's

[13:10:43 - 13:10:48]
installed um we'll launch it up here and

[13:10:45 - 13:10:49]
see what the experience is like okay

[13:10:48 - 13:10:52]
there's a lot of coding tools out here

[13:10:49 - 13:10:55]
but uh you know we'll go through as many

[13:10:52 - 13:10:57]
as we can here without overdoing it here

[13:10:55 - 13:10:58]
uh op add add to this stuff now I'm

[13:10:57 - 13:11:00]
going to leave those alone we'll go

[13:10:58 - 13:11:03]
ahead and hit next be back here in just

[13:11:00 - 13:11:04]
a moment as it's installing and yeah

[13:11:03 - 13:11:06]
it's just installing here so we'll wait

[13:11:04 - 13:11:08]
a little bit there we go looks like wind

[13:11:06 - 13:11:11]
surf is in install we'll go ahead and

[13:11:08 - 13:11:13]
hit enter here I've never used the wind

[13:11:11 - 13:11:16]
surf interface I have used codium in the

[13:11:13 - 13:11:17]
past and I have liked codium uh codium

[13:11:16 - 13:11:19]
code generation but it's been I don't

[13:11:17 - 13:11:22]
know at least six seven months since I

[13:11:19 - 13:11:24]
used it last um I'm just allowing access

[13:11:22 - 13:11:26]
to uh to wind serve here on another

[13:11:24 - 13:11:28]
screen I'm not sure why it popped on

[13:11:26 - 13:11:30]
another screen as that's not my main

[13:11:28 - 13:11:33]
screen and I can't even move it this is

[13:11:30 - 13:11:39]
so stupid I have to hit get started I

[13:11:33 - 13:11:39]
can't what come on let me move it

[13:11:39 - 13:11:44]
okay

[13:11:41 - 13:11:45]
um how am I going to show this off if

[13:11:44 - 13:11:48]
it's on the wrong screen one second here

[13:11:45 - 13:11:50]
I'm just going

[13:11:48 - 13:11:52]
to change my screen here a little bit so

[13:11:50 - 13:11:53]
you can at least see what's going on

[13:11:52 - 13:11:57]
here as this is really

[13:11:53 - 13:11:59]
dumb um this is now over here you can

[13:11:57 - 13:12:01]
see the spreadsheet of what I used to

[13:11:59 - 13:12:03]
get stuff started here so I click

[13:12:01 - 13:12:05]
getting started it says import from vs

[13:12:03 - 13:12:08]
code import from precursor we'll start

[13:12:05 - 13:12:10]
from scratch um actually Vim is my

[13:12:08 - 13:12:13]
default key binding so I would like that

[13:12:10 - 13:12:15]
dark seems nice let's go for Tokyo

[13:12:13 - 13:12:19]
night just because it has a bit of a

[13:12:15 - 13:12:19]
Japanese tee we need to log

[13:12:19 - 13:12:25]
in I mean I should have a codium account

[13:12:22 - 13:12:26]
already this it outs redirecting to the

[13:12:25 - 13:12:28]
other

[13:12:26 - 13:12:30]
screen it looks like I might already be

[13:12:28 - 13:12:34]
logged into codium from a long time ago

[13:12:30 - 13:12:35]
says hi Andrew let's Surf and now I can

[13:12:34 - 13:12:37]
move it I don't know why they did it

[13:12:35 - 13:12:40]
that way I'm going to move back to our

[13:12:37 - 13:12:40]
original

[13:12:40 - 13:12:44]
screen

[13:12:41 - 13:12:47]
which is this one here there we go I'll

[13:12:44 - 13:12:51]
move that back over to here and I mean

[13:12:47 - 13:12:53]
it looks kind of like cursor that's for

[13:12:51 - 13:12:56]
certain um but let's go ahead and open a

[13:12:53 - 13:12:58]
folder so I want to open up um that

[13:12:56 - 13:13:01]
sites directory so I'm just looking for

[13:12:58 - 13:13:04]
it off screen here

[13:13:01 - 13:13:06]
and I'm looking for that folder here

[13:13:04 - 13:13:08]
what did we call that folder Jing

[13:13:06 - 13:13:09]
Essentials there it is and so we'll

[13:13:08 - 13:13:13]
select that folder that's going to open

[13:13:09 - 13:13:14]
up here I'm going to trust I'm not a

[13:13:13 - 13:13:17]
really big fan of these like allinone

[13:13:14 - 13:13:18]
interfaces like cursor um I mean wind

[13:13:17 - 13:13:21]
surf I don't know we'll find out here

[13:13:18 - 13:13:22]
but um I don't know it just feels like

[13:13:21 - 13:13:24]
you're too much into this ecosystem but

[13:13:22 - 13:13:26]
maybe the experience is really nice with

[13:13:24 - 13:13:28]
Cascade right with Cascade kick off a

[13:13:26 - 13:13:30]
new project or make changes across your

[13:13:28 - 13:13:31]
entire code base oh that sounds fun I'm

[13:13:30 - 13:13:33]
going to go ahead and make a new folder

[13:13:31 - 13:13:35]
here we're going to call this uh wind

[13:13:33 - 13:13:38]
surf we are using codium but we're going

[13:13:35 - 13:13:39]
to call this wind surf and I'm going to

[13:13:38 - 13:13:41]
make a new folder here and this is going

[13:13:39 - 13:13:45]
to be called

[13:13:41 - 13:13:45]
um link tree

[13:13:46 - 13:13:52]
clone

[13:13:49 - 13:13:54]
okay is that a file or a folder I can't

[13:13:52 - 13:13:56]
tell I'll make a new file here called

[13:13:54 - 13:13:58]
main.go okay this is something we've

[13:13:56 - 13:14:00]
been doing constantly here uh we'll

[13:13:58 - 13:14:03]
install the go extension down below I do

[13:14:00 - 13:14:06]
like the interface that it's very uh

[13:14:03 - 13:14:07]
Compact and we have Cascade up here I'm

[13:14:06 - 13:14:10]
not sure why it's called Cascade but

[13:14:07 - 13:14:13]
that's totally fine I want to go over

[13:14:10 - 13:14:15]
into here and I'm going to just say it

[13:14:13 - 13:14:17]
must be the name of their chat I suppose

[13:14:15 - 13:14:21]
and so I'm going to just say I want to

[13:14:17 - 13:14:25]
build a simple uh web app uh that is

[13:14:21 - 13:14:28]
apid driven uh rid

[13:14:25 - 13:14:29]
driven ridden and goang I wonder if we

[13:14:28 - 13:14:31]
could bump up the font here this is a

[13:14:29 - 13:14:33]
little bit small ridden and

[13:14:31 - 13:14:35]
goang I know there's like a write and a

[13:14:33 - 13:14:38]
chat

[13:14:35 - 13:14:39]
mode when right mode is turned on casc

[13:14:38 - 13:14:41]
will be able to make changes in your

[13:14:39 - 13:14:42]
code but we imported an entire folder so

[13:14:41 - 13:14:44]
I wonder if it's going to get confused

[13:14:42 - 13:14:46]
about this the other thing I noticed is

[13:14:44 - 13:14:49]
that we can change the models there is

[13:14:46 - 13:14:51]
the Cascade base model so Cascade base

[13:14:49 - 13:14:53]
does not use premium user prompt or

[13:14:51 - 13:14:56]
premium flow so I could have swore that

[13:14:53 - 13:14:57]
this is what um I thought codium it was

[13:14:56 - 13:15:00]
like engineered for that but anyway

[13:14:57 - 13:15:02]
we'll see here I want to build a simple

[13:15:00 - 13:15:08]
web app that is API driven written in

[13:15:02 - 13:15:10]
goang uh to clone a link tree um app so

[13:15:08 - 13:15:13]
I guess it's just using Cloud underneath

[13:15:10 - 13:15:16]
but I really thought I really thought

[13:15:13 - 13:15:16]
here that um

[13:15:16 - 13:15:23]
codium so now I'm confused we have the

[13:15:19 - 13:15:26]
AI That's in your ID of choice Forge in

[13:15:23 - 13:15:26]
browser grounded chat

[13:15:28 - 13:15:31]
okay okay then what's

[13:15:31 - 13:15:37]
Cascade so now I'm

[13:15:35 - 13:15:39]
confused let's take a look at the

[13:15:37 - 13:15:41]
pricing well it's free forever on this

[13:15:39 - 13:15:41]
Cascade

[13:15:42 - 13:15:46]
credits I don't know now I really don't

[13:15:44 - 13:15:48]
know that's okay let's go back over to

[13:15:46 - 13:15:50]
here and see what we have um it looks

[13:15:48 - 13:15:52]
like it's working in this folder which

[13:15:50 - 13:15:54]
is

[13:15:52 - 13:15:56]
good I'll help you create a link tree

[13:15:54 - 13:15:57]
clone using go API backend simple front

[13:15:56 - 13:16:01]
end let's break down the code of these

[13:15:57 - 13:16:02]
steps I see you have a main.go file a go

[13:16:01 - 13:16:07]
backend with rest API end points a

[13:16:02 - 13:16:08]
simple front end um MH I like that it's

[13:16:07 - 13:16:09]
going to produce a front end that's kind

[13:16:08 - 13:16:14]
of

[13:16:09 - 13:16:16]
cool this is so far pretty cool um

[13:16:14 - 13:16:21]
suggested terminal command not

[13:16:16 - 13:16:23]
necessarily because we want to use

[13:16:21 - 13:16:25]
um

[13:16:23 - 13:16:28]
uh I don't want to reject I don't want

[13:16:25 - 13:16:28]
to run that

[13:16:29 - 13:16:33]
command we just accept

[13:16:31 - 13:16:36]
all but let's take a look at what we've

[13:16:33 - 13:16:38]
generated out so we have Gorilla which

[13:16:36 - 13:16:40]
we've learned this is obviously for

[13:16:38 - 13:16:41]
Cores because they built the front end

[13:16:40 - 13:16:45]
for us which I'm really surprised we

[13:16:41 - 13:16:46]
have our structure which comes from uh I

[13:16:45 - 13:16:48]
think it's part of

[13:16:46 - 13:16:51]
gorilla whatever their om kind of

[13:16:48 - 13:16:53]
solution is here we have some uh filler

[13:16:51 - 13:16:56]
data which is fine we have get profile

[13:16:53 - 13:16:58]
update profile ad link we have some

[13:16:56 - 13:17:01]
links in here and those look pretty good

[13:16:58 - 13:17:03]
we have cores option which is really

[13:17:01 - 13:17:05]
really good like I I really like this

[13:17:03 - 13:17:06]
code this is really really good let's go

[13:17:05 - 13:17:09]
look at the static file I'm curious what

[13:17:06 - 13:17:13]
we have have here um very simple

[13:17:09 - 13:17:15]
application we have plain JavaScript wow

[13:17:13 - 13:17:17]
they're just like hidden home runs here

[13:17:15 - 13:17:19]
now you might say well Andrew wouldn't

[13:17:17 - 13:17:22]
you prefer reacting whatever whatever I

[13:17:19 - 13:17:24]
guess so but the fact is the fact is

[13:17:22 - 13:17:25]
that I kind of like this because when I

[13:17:24 - 13:17:29]
started a project I like to use the

[13:17:25 - 13:17:30]
simplest type of um JavaScript and HTML

[13:17:29 - 13:17:32]
keep everything minimal so I would say

[13:17:30 - 13:17:34]
like this is a really good balance of

[13:17:32 - 13:17:37]
like using a higher level abstraction

[13:17:34 - 13:17:38]
but also keeping the code minimal but of

[13:17:37 - 13:17:40]
course this is just Claude Sonet right

[13:17:38 - 13:17:42]
so we're getting like really excited

[13:17:40 - 13:17:45]
here for Claude Sonet um but I can't

[13:17:42 - 13:17:48]
really determine where wind surf starts

[13:17:45 - 13:17:50]
and where wind surf ends um because

[13:17:48 - 13:17:51]
that's not that clear to me so maybe

[13:17:50 - 13:17:54]
that's something we should read a little

[13:17:51 - 13:17:55]
bit about before we proceed here um

[13:17:54 - 13:17:58]
because I just don't understand like

[13:17:55 - 13:18:01]
what what is it that wind surf is like

[13:17:58 - 13:18:02]
doing that's so special here compared to

[13:18:01 - 13:18:04]
whatever so we have casc collaborative

[13:18:02 - 13:18:06]
agentic chat

[13:18:04 - 13:18:08]
experience oh so these are probably its

[13:18:06 - 13:18:09]
features okay okay let's go ahead here

[13:18:08 - 13:18:11]
and take a

[13:18:09 - 13:18:14]
look

[13:18:11 - 13:18:16]
so I guess Cascade just must mean its

[13:18:14 - 13:18:19]
actual flow of how it actually works so

[13:18:16 - 13:18:21]
only available in Wind surf editor uh

[13:18:19 - 13:18:24]
agentic capabilities unlock a new level

[13:18:21 - 13:18:29]
of collaboration between Ai and

[13:18:24 - 13:18:29]
human what can it do fold contextual

[13:18:30 - 13:18:34]
awareness okay suggest and run commands

[13:18:33 - 13:18:37]
pick up where you last left off

[13:18:34 - 13:18:40]
multifile editing the experience is

[13:18:37 - 13:18:41]
really nice so I guess it's just it's

[13:18:40 - 13:18:43]
like an enhanced chat is what they're

[13:18:41 - 13:18:46]
trying to say there on the right hand

[13:18:43 - 13:18:48]
side um updates the schema type of

[13:18:46 - 13:18:50]
Sanitation rename variables

[13:18:48 - 13:18:53]
automatically bind handlers okay I mean

[13:18:50 - 13:18:54]
pretty pretty standard stuff here um

[13:18:53 - 13:18:56]
codium

[13:18:54 - 13:18:58]
autocomplete I guess the only challenge

[13:18:56 - 13:19:02]
here with like since I don't know goang

[13:18:58 - 13:19:04]
that well like writing it day in and day

[13:19:02 - 13:19:06]
out it's like I never know really what

[13:19:04 - 13:19:08]
to write and I'm so very much reliant on

[13:19:06 - 13:19:11]
it the stuff here but let's go back over

[13:19:08 - 13:19:13]
to let's say toggle Cascade with contr L

[13:19:11 - 13:19:15]
does that work it does no conflicts with

[13:19:13 - 13:19:17]
my Vim commands and we're still in the

[13:19:15 - 13:19:22]
main go so I would just say the one

[13:19:17 - 13:19:27]
thing here is that um I want to use SQL

[13:19:22 - 13:19:31]
light SQL light 3 as the

[13:19:27 - 13:19:31]
database and let's see if we can do

[13:19:35 - 13:19:39]
that now can't remember what else it

[13:19:37 - 13:19:43]
said that it had here besides

[13:19:39 - 13:19:44]
Claude GPT 40 okay so that'd be cool if

[13:19:43 - 13:19:46]
I mean these are the two main ones I

[13:19:44 - 13:19:49]
basically use more yeah yeah that's the

[13:19:46 - 13:19:52]
B basically two on So the fact is like

[13:19:49 - 13:19:54]
if you are instead of paying for GPT 40

[13:19:52 - 13:19:55]
and cloudon it you pay for this then it

[13:19:54 - 13:19:56]
seems like you get the basis of

[13:19:55 - 13:19:59]
everything and it's really good at

[13:19:56 - 13:20:01]
putting things where they should go this

[13:19:59 - 13:20:03]
is super super

[13:20:01 - 13:20:05]
nice yeah so over here I'm in my plan

[13:20:03 - 13:20:09]
and I can actually see my credit

[13:20:05 - 13:20:11]
use okay okay so user prompt credits

[13:20:09 - 13:20:14]
using a premium model Cascade costs one

[13:20:11 - 13:20:16]
prompt credit per use so I have 50 more

[13:20:14 - 13:20:19]
if I go to pricing I'm just trying to

[13:20:16 - 13:20:21]
understand then we have like 500 premium

[13:20:19 - 13:20:22]
models uh user prompt credits 1,500

[13:20:21 - 13:20:25]
premium

[13:20:22 - 13:20:28]
models um I mean that's fine but like

[13:20:25 - 13:20:31]
the thing is is that if I was using

[13:20:28 - 13:20:34]
um uh chat like if I was paying $20 a

[13:20:31 - 13:20:37]
month for chaty BT I'll never run out of

[13:20:34 - 13:20:39]
a GPT 40 I don't think I would maybe I

[13:20:37 - 13:20:40]
would I don't know um but just the fact

[13:20:39 - 13:20:42]
that it's putting everything in the

[13:20:40 - 13:20:45]
correct place in such an easy way is

[13:20:42 - 13:20:48]
really nice so taking a look here um

[13:20:45 - 13:20:52]
nothing's changed

[13:20:48 - 13:20:55]
here so I'm not sure why I did

[13:20:52 - 13:20:57]
that uh that's been replaced that's good

[13:20:55 - 13:20:59]
we have uh that it's actually using link

[13:20:57 - 13:21:00]
tree which is a much better name here

[13:20:59 - 13:21:04]
it's creating the tables not necessarily

[13:21:00 - 13:21:04]
what I'd wanted to do but that's

[13:21:05 - 13:21:09]
fine is that definely way easier than

[13:21:07 - 13:21:12]
working within

[13:21:09 - 13:21:15]
CLA so I would say I don't want the go

[13:21:12 - 13:21:17]
mod tidy because again I'm going to run

[13:21:15 - 13:21:20]
this in

[13:21:17 - 13:21:21]
um uh WSL right so I'm going to open

[13:21:20 - 13:21:26]
this up maybe it doesn't know that I'm

[13:21:21 - 13:21:28]
using WSL so I'm going to go over to um

[13:21:26 - 13:21:28]
ubu

[13:21:29 - 13:21:33]
here okay does it not have that

[13:21:31 - 13:21:35]
extension installed sure we'll install

[13:21:33 - 13:21:37]
it even if I pretty sure it already has

[13:21:35 - 13:21:41]
that that's fine

[13:21:37 - 13:21:42]
um so now what I'd like to do is CD into

[13:21:41 - 13:21:45]
wind

[13:21:42 - 13:21:48]
serf link tree

[13:21:45 - 13:21:51]
clone okay and so we have code here the

[13:21:48 - 13:21:55]
only thing I would say that we don't

[13:21:51 - 13:21:58]
have is well actually no it does seed it

[13:21:55 - 13:21:58]
does set up the tables

[13:21:58 - 13:22:03]
initially okay I'm just going to say uh

[13:22:00 - 13:22:06]
can you in the readme file can

[13:22:03 - 13:22:08]
you can you create a read uh can you

[13:22:06 - 13:22:14]
create a read

[13:22:08 - 13:22:14]
me with a bash command to seed the

[13:22:15 - 13:22:19]
database okay hopefully it creates n SE

[13:22:17 - 13:22:19]
to the

[13:22:21 - 13:22:25]
database I'm very curious what it' be

[13:22:23 - 13:22:28]
like if I switch it over to chat g chat

[13:22:25 - 13:22:30]
GPT like GPT 40 but um anthropic CLA is

[13:22:28 - 13:22:31]
working pretty well I also kind of

[13:22:30 - 13:22:33]
Wonder like this is obviously not the

[13:22:31 - 13:22:35]
agent it's API end point so maybe

[13:22:33 - 13:22:37]
they're doing some kind of other magic

[13:22:35 - 13:22:39]
underneath uh so we'll go over to our

[13:22:37 - 13:22:42]
our readme.md

[13:22:39 - 13:22:45]
[Music]

[13:22:42 - 13:22:46]
and it's okay but it keeps thinking that

[13:22:45 - 13:22:49]
we're

[13:22:46 - 13:22:52]
using Windows and we're not using

[13:22:49 - 13:22:56]
Windows so I want to go over to

[13:22:52 - 13:23:03]
here so this is go sqlite 3 yeah that's

[13:22:56 - 13:23:03]
fine um why does it keep suggesting tidy

[13:23:11 - 13:23:18]
I think again tidy is specifically for

[13:23:14 - 13:23:22]
um I think tidy is

[13:23:18 - 13:23:26]
for Windows goang

[13:23:22 - 13:23:26]
tidy and there's just a bit of confusion

[13:23:33 - 13:23:38]
there no that's for tidying

[13:23:37 - 13:23:40]
oh maybe that's what that actually is

[13:23:38 - 13:23:44]
it's the Tidy

[13:23:40 - 13:23:45]
mod attempt to proceed to uh so tidy

[13:23:44 - 13:23:47]
matches the source code in the module

[13:23:45 - 13:23:49]
adds missing uh Missing module

[13:23:47 - 13:23:51]
requirements necessary to build the

[13:23:49 - 13:23:53]
current's module package and spenden oh

[13:23:51 - 13:23:56]
okay that actually doesn't seem like a

[13:23:53 - 13:23:59]
bad idea let's go ahead and run

[13:23:56 - 13:24:02]
that it's saying uh mod not found cannot

[13:23:59 - 13:24:04]
be installed um can be installed with

[13:24:02 - 13:24:07]
this

[13:24:04 - 13:24:10]
um okay maybe we would had to install

[13:24:07 - 13:24:10]
that mod another way

[13:24:11 - 13:24:17]
here now let's install the required go

[13:24:13 - 13:24:19]
dependencies and run the server and so

[13:24:17 - 13:24:21]
here it's saying to do go mod

[13:24:19 - 13:24:27]
[Music]

[13:24:21 - 13:24:27]
tidy okay um go mod

[13:24:28 - 13:24:35]
tidy go mod tidy go mod

[13:24:33 - 13:24:37]
tidy I don't know I for some reason

[13:24:35 - 13:24:38]
thought it had to do something with SQL

[13:24:37 - 13:24:41]
light 3 I must have been reading

[13:24:38 - 13:24:43]
misreading something earlier but anyway

[13:24:41 - 13:24:44]
I guess that got everything we wanted

[13:24:43 - 13:24:46]
installed the other thing that we need

[13:24:44 - 13:24:49]
to run in our readme here

[13:24:46 - 13:24:53]
is

[13:24:49 - 13:24:53]
um uh this

[13:24:57 - 13:25:02]
here I'll paste that in down below enter

[13:25:00 - 13:25:05]
and so now we have our link our our link

[13:25:02 - 13:25:08]
Tre DB here we can go get our extension

[13:25:05 - 13:25:11]
which would be our go light

[13:25:08 - 13:25:13]
Vier and we'll go to this one as this

[13:25:11 - 13:25:15]
one kind of works good enough if you

[13:25:13 - 13:25:17]
find the better one definitely tell me

[13:25:15 - 13:25:19]
it's not my favorite but it works and so

[13:25:17 - 13:25:21]
we'll go over to here to link tree I

[13:25:19 - 13:25:22]
just want to make sure data is there so

[13:25:21 - 13:25:24]
we have links and a profile that's

[13:25:22 - 13:25:26]
really good we're going to go back over

[13:25:24 - 13:25:29]
to here

[13:25:26 - 13:25:31]
um and if we want to start it just be go

[13:25:29 - 13:25:33]
go main run

[13:25:31 - 13:25:36]
go now that's going to start the back

[13:25:33 - 13:25:40]
end but we also have a front end which I

[13:25:36 - 13:25:42]
wasn't expecting to have um but we can

[13:25:40 - 13:25:43]
test it here in just a moment I want to

[13:25:42 - 13:25:46]
go ahead here and just open another

[13:25:43 - 13:25:48]
Ubuntu window and I want to see if we

[13:25:46 - 13:25:50]
can get the profile information I also

[13:25:48 - 13:25:52]
kind of wonder if it's polling it's it's

[13:25:50 - 13:25:54]
taking any kind of context of our

[13:25:52 - 13:25:56]
existing code I don't think it has but

[13:25:54 - 13:25:58]
here it's saying on Port 880 this is

[13:25:56 - 13:26:00]
running on oh it's still starting so

[13:25:58 - 13:26:02]
we'll give it a moment here to get ready

[13:26:00 - 13:26:03]
okay all right so that built let's go

[13:26:02 - 13:26:08]
ahead

[13:26:03 - 13:26:10]
and oh module requires go 1.16 oh well

[13:26:08 - 13:26:12]
what version of go did it set it

[13:26:10 - 13:26:14]
as this says

[13:26:12 - 13:26:17]
121

[13:26:14 - 13:26:17]
H

[13:26:19 - 13:26:24]
121 okay so what we'll

[13:26:21 - 13:26:26]
do we'll just change the Go

[13:26:24 - 13:26:28]
version let's see if we can do that can

[13:26:26 - 13:26:30]
we just do that can we just change the

[13:26:28 - 13:26:33]
Go version like

[13:26:30 - 13:26:33]
that go mod

[13:26:34 - 13:26:40]
tidy go

[13:26:37 - 13:26:47]
run mod.

[13:26:40 - 13:26:49]
go or uh main.go main.go can we do

[13:26:47 - 13:26:51]
that I mean it just says like hey I want

[13:26:49 - 13:26:53]
this very specific version but um one

[13:26:51 - 13:26:55]
thing I would like to check here is what

[13:26:53 - 13:26:57]
other versions were we running before so

[13:26:55 - 13:27:01]
if we go into any of them like Gemini

[13:26:57 - 13:27:03]
not Gemini the Amazon sorry Gemini I was

[13:27:01 - 13:27:07]
just not not good whatsoever this one's

[13:27:03 - 13:27:09]
saying 113 I put 116 as the minimal here

[13:27:07 - 13:27:11]
um I'm wondering also if we go to GitHub

[13:27:09 - 13:27:13]
co-pilot where we had moderate success

[13:27:11 - 13:27:16]
this is 118 so there's some variations

[13:27:13 - 13:27:17]
here but um it seems like if we pick one

[13:27:16 - 13:27:20]
of these versions then we'll be in good

[13:27:17 - 13:27:24]
shape so 116 was the minimum that it

[13:27:20 - 13:27:26]
wanted to be um I'm assuming it's

[13:27:24 - 13:27:29]
building unless I need to delete the

[13:27:26 - 13:27:29]
goome

[13:27:29 - 13:27:33]
file yeah like it's not doing anything

[13:27:32 - 13:27:36]
so I'm what I'm going to do here is I'm

[13:27:33 - 13:27:38]
going to delete out the goome file

[13:27:36 - 13:27:41]
I don't even know how I know what I'm

[13:27:38 - 13:27:47]
doing but I do and so we'll do go go

[13:27:41 - 13:27:50]
tidy go um was it Go mod tidy there we

[13:27:47 - 13:27:52]
go and so now we have a new sum file and

[13:27:50 - 13:27:56]
we'll go ahead and run go main.go and

[13:27:52 - 13:27:56]
see if we have some success

[13:28:01 - 13:28:04]
here one other thing I kind of Wonder is

[13:28:03 - 13:28:06]
like can we see what version of go we're

[13:28:04 - 13:28:09]
running Go version is that something we

[13:28:06 - 13:28:09]
can do

[13:28:10 - 13:28:15]
here probably

[13:28:13 - 13:28:17]
not probably doesn't work the way I

[13:28:15 - 13:28:18]
think it does but anyway we're just

[13:28:17 - 13:28:21]
going to wait here a little bit and see

[13:28:18 - 13:28:22]
what happens I still don't know why it's

[13:28:21 - 13:28:24]
not working I've been waiting here so

[13:28:22 - 13:28:27]
what I'm going to do this is a bit of a

[13:28:24 - 13:28:29]
cheat but I'm going to go to another one

[13:28:27 - 13:28:32]
what we know that works like this one

[13:28:29 - 13:28:37]
here um not that one but maybe the

[13:28:32 - 13:28:40]
Amazon Q developer one as this one

[13:28:37 - 13:28:44]
here oh no it actually worked never mind

[13:28:40 - 13:28:47]
it's saying module requires 1.16 for SQL

[13:28:44 - 13:28:51]
so the issue is specifically with SQL so

[13:28:47 - 13:28:54]
I want to go back over to our uh go mod

[13:28:51 - 13:28:55]
here and it doesn't like this version of

[13:28:54 - 13:28:57]
SQL

[13:28:55 - 13:29:00]
light I suppose we could just ask it to

[13:28:57 - 13:29:01]
fix it um I just don't want to waste our

[13:29:00 - 13:29:05]
completions but I guess we have tons of

[13:29:01 - 13:29:05]
them so I'll just go ahead and do that

[13:29:11 - 13:29:15]
okay um let's give it a

[13:29:16 - 13:29:20]
try this we also have to accept this

[13:29:18 - 13:29:20]
first

[13:29:24 - 13:29:28]
though where did it insert

[13:29:33 - 13:29:36]
it uh we don't want to inserted there

[13:29:35 - 13:29:37]
that's for sure

[13:29:36 - 13:29:40]
so I'm just going to clear this out here

[13:29:37 - 13:29:40]
for a

[13:29:40 - 13:29:44]
second I think I didn't understand what

[13:29:43 - 13:29:46]
I wanted when I said insert but that's

[13:29:44 - 13:29:53]
fine go mod

[13:29:46 - 13:29:53]
tidy go mod um G run main.go

[13:29:54 - 13:29:57]
we'll give it a moment

[13:29:58 - 13:30:02]
here I mean it seems like this one's

[13:30:00 - 13:30:06]
actually working so we'll just wait a

[13:30:02 - 13:30:09]
bit all right so um oh it says there's

[13:30:06 - 13:30:09]
already port in

[13:30:09 - 13:30:14]
use so maybe I have one running from

[13:30:12 - 13:30:18]
before that I need to stop let we go

[13:30:14 - 13:30:21]
ahead here there we go and we'll go back

[13:30:18 - 13:30:24]
here and we'll try to start this

[13:30:21 - 13:30:25]
again there we go now it's serving on

[13:30:24 - 13:30:27]
Port

[13:30:25 - 13:30:30]
880 uh that doesn't give me a little

[13:30:27 - 13:30:33]
popup that's okay we can make our way

[13:30:30 - 13:30:36]
over to our own browser over here we'll

[13:30:33 - 13:30:40]
just say Local Host 880

[13:30:36 - 13:30:41]
oh yeah we have an interface what how do

[13:30:40 - 13:30:43]
we have an interface

[13:30:41 - 13:30:46]
oh you know we didn't really review the

[13:30:43 - 13:30:48]
code but I bet it's serving up the uh um

[13:30:46 - 13:30:50]
the HTML let me go take a look here I

[13:30:48 - 13:30:52]
would have thought because we said it to

[13:30:50 - 13:30:54]
for it to be API only but let's go take

[13:30:52 - 13:30:57]
a look here um maybe they have like a

[13:30:54 - 13:30:58]
single end point for it so it's mostly

[13:30:57 - 13:31:02]
API

[13:30:58 - 13:31:06]
driven so have main API profile API

[13:31:02 - 13:31:10]
profile links path prefix port 8080

[13:31:06 - 13:31:13]
add the link okay but what's serving it

[13:31:10 - 13:31:13]
[Music]

[13:31:16 - 13:31:21]
up maybe just nose to serve it because

[13:31:19 - 13:31:24]
it's using Gorilla

[13:31:21 - 13:31:26]
MX yeah because we didn't specify it

[13:31:24 - 13:31:29]
must be it just must know to do oh here

[13:31:26 - 13:31:30]
it is so serve St files at this location

[13:31:29 - 13:31:31]
okay so they added it here and that's

[13:31:30 - 13:31:33]
how it knows and so that's how we have

[13:31:31 - 13:31:37]
it that's really really cool now here's

[13:31:33 - 13:31:38]
a question um could I actually update

[13:31:37 - 13:31:41]
any of this stuff now we don't have that

[13:31:38 - 13:31:44]
in our interface here um but if we were

[13:31:41 - 13:31:48]
to go take a look here we have API

[13:31:44 - 13:31:51]
links and we have ad

[13:31:48 - 13:31:53]
link so let's go over to our read me and

[13:31:51 - 13:31:53]
see we have any

[13:31:55 - 13:32:00]
examples

[13:31:58 - 13:32:02]
Okay add a link so this would be for

[13:32:00 - 13:32:06]
Twitter we don't have Twitter uh up

[13:32:02 - 13:32:07]
above here so hopefully that just works

[13:32:06 - 13:32:10]
so I'm going to go over to our other tab

[13:32:07 - 13:32:13]
here we'll go down below I'll just paste

[13:32:10 - 13:32:16]
it in hit enter and we'll go back over

[13:32:13 - 13:32:18]
to here give us a refresh and we now

[13:32:16 - 13:32:23]
have Twitter so that's pretty sweet it

[13:32:18 - 13:32:25]
just works okay so that's awesome um

[13:32:23 - 13:32:27]
yeah I guess

[13:32:25 - 13:32:29]
that's

[13:32:27 - 13:32:32]
basically um wind serve I just don't

[13:32:29 - 13:32:34]
feel like we used it to its full

[13:32:32 - 13:32:36]
potential um just wanted to take a look

[13:32:34 - 13:32:39]
here just because did such a good job

[13:32:36 - 13:32:42]
working with Cascade in such few lines

[13:32:39 - 13:32:43]
that I felt like uh we didn't really get

[13:32:42 - 13:32:45]
to fully experience it but if we right

[13:32:43 - 13:32:47]
click here I'm just curious like does it

[13:32:45 - 13:32:49]
have any of the other commands we have

[13:32:47 - 13:32:51]
chat with

[13:32:49 - 13:32:54]
Cascade

[13:32:51 - 13:32:56]
um we have go generate unit test for

[13:32:54 - 13:32:59]
function but that's specifically with go

[13:32:56 - 13:33:00]
this is not necessarily with that so I

[13:32:59 - 13:33:02]
don't know I don't feel like I fully

[13:33:00 - 13:33:05]
used wind

[13:33:02 - 13:33:07]
serf but this experience was really

[13:33:05 - 13:33:07]
really good

[13:33:08 - 13:33:12]
yeah so maybe if we were coding

[13:33:10 - 13:33:14]
something like Ruby or python as we were

[13:33:12 - 13:33:15]
writing the code and we having more

[13:33:14 - 13:33:17]
direct control over it we'd have a

[13:33:15 - 13:33:19]
better thing but yeah this experience at

[13:33:17 - 13:33:21]
least in this limited limited experience

[13:33:19 - 13:33:24]
was pretty good for me and so we'll go

[13:33:21 - 13:33:26]
ahead and commit this

[13:33:24 - 13:33:28]
um yeah I think that's my favorite so

[13:33:26 - 13:33:30]
far has been wind surf but we'll see

[13:33:28 - 13:33:33]
maybe cursor is going to change my mind

[13:33:30 - 13:33:34]
here um it doesn't have access to uh

[13:33:33 - 13:33:37]
that that's totally fine I'm just going

[13:33:34 - 13:33:40]
to go cheat and go over to here because

[13:33:37 - 13:33:43]
these are shared repos and I'll just add

[13:33:40 - 13:33:46]
it over whoops not here but I will go to

[13:33:43 - 13:33:48]
this one here because it's the same

[13:33:46 - 13:33:48]
source code

[13:33:49 - 13:33:55]
right and it should show up

[13:33:53 - 13:33:58]
here oh it's right there okay we'll just

[13:33:55 - 13:34:00]
sync the changes from over here and I

[13:33:58 - 13:34:04]
will see you in the next one okay

[13:34:00 - 13:34:06]
[Music]

[13:34:04 - 13:34:09]
ciao all right right so in this video I

[13:34:06 - 13:34:11]
want to take a look at um

[13:34:09 - 13:34:14]
cursor so cursor is very very very

[13:34:11 - 13:34:16]
popular but in my experience I have not

[13:34:14 - 13:34:18]
liked cursor as much as other folks have

[13:34:16 - 13:34:20]
um but you know we'll give it another

[13:34:18 - 13:34:22]
try and maybe it is better from my last

[13:34:20 - 13:34:24]
experience what I found was that when I

[13:34:22 - 13:34:26]
was typing it would get in the way

[13:34:24 - 13:34:27]
however since we're working with goang I

[13:34:26 - 13:34:28]
don't feel like we're using the inline

[13:34:27 - 13:34:30]
code feature as much so I might have

[13:34:28 - 13:34:32]
made a mistake coding in golang as

[13:34:30 - 13:34:34]
opposed to something like Ruby or python

[13:34:32 - 13:34:35]
but I'm going to just keep sticking with

[13:34:34 - 13:34:38]
golang here and we'll best evaluate this

[13:34:35 - 13:34:44]
tool um and see what it can produce

[13:34:38 - 13:34:47]
cursor plugs into other um other uh um

[13:34:44 - 13:34:48]
llm so if we're using Sonet then I would

[13:34:47 - 13:34:50]
expect that it would have very similar

[13:34:48 - 13:34:52]
results to to codium but I really did

[13:34:50 - 13:34:54]
like the codium experience uh but we

[13:34:52 - 13:34:56]
will see here with cursor in just a

[13:34:54 - 13:34:59]
moment and I am just going to install

[13:34:56 - 13:35:02]
the latest version I already have cursor

[13:34:59 - 13:35:03]
installed but I'm not sure what version

[13:35:02 - 13:35:07]
I have installed so let's make sure we

[13:35:03 - 13:35:09]
have the latest uh set up up here and uh

[13:35:07 - 13:35:09]
we'll get to it

[13:35:10 - 13:35:14]
okay all right so we have cursor here

[13:35:12 - 13:35:16]
we'll let it uh you have Windows system

[13:35:14 - 13:35:20]
at WSL so it's getting the WSL plugin so

[13:35:16 - 13:35:21]
it can work with it um and so I mean

[13:35:20 - 13:35:23]
this experience looks pretty much the

[13:35:21 - 13:35:25]
same it's even opening up code that I

[13:35:23 - 13:35:27]
had uh that I had ran here before but

[13:35:25 - 13:35:29]
I'm going to have to open up uh that

[13:35:27 - 13:35:32]
folder as we've been working on it so

[13:35:29 - 13:35:34]
this has been called The geni

[13:35:32 - 13:35:38]
Essentials if I can find it here here it

[13:35:34 - 13:35:40]
is so we'll go ahead and select this

[13:35:38 - 13:35:42]
folder

[13:35:40 - 13:35:44]
okay and as per usual we're going to

[13:35:42 - 13:35:47]
continue on doing what we've been doing

[13:35:44 - 13:35:49]
so this is going to be

[13:35:47 - 13:35:52]
um

[13:35:49 - 13:35:54]
cursor cursor Ai and I'm going to go

[13:35:52 - 13:35:58]
ahead and make a new folder here we'll

[13:35:54 - 13:35:59]
call this the link tree colog and then

[13:35:58 - 13:36:01]
within that we'll have our main doc go

[13:35:59 - 13:36:02]
now I remember when I first used this

[13:36:01 - 13:36:04]
they took me through a whole tutorial to

[13:36:02 - 13:36:06]
tell me all the commands I don't

[13:36:04 - 13:36:07]
remember what the commands are um so I'm

[13:36:06 - 13:36:10]
just going to stumble my way through

[13:36:07 - 13:36:11]
here uh we'll ignore that that seemed

[13:36:10 - 13:36:12]
like it happened to the other one as

[13:36:11 - 13:36:16]
well we'll open up our terminal make

[13:36:12 - 13:36:19]
sure we're over in WSL so we're not

[13:36:16 - 13:36:22]
confused um so we close that out there

[13:36:19 - 13:36:25]
and so the question is how do we bring

[13:36:22 - 13:36:27]
up our stuff here that's remote

[13:36:25 - 13:36:28]
controller I'm trying to figure out how

[13:36:27 - 13:36:31]
do we

[13:36:28 - 13:36:31]
bring

[13:36:32 - 13:36:36]
[Music]

[13:36:33 - 13:36:38]
over the chat so so we'll go down to

[13:36:36 - 13:36:41]
here in the bottom left

[13:36:38 - 13:36:43]
corner chat

[13:36:41 - 13:36:45]
cursor and they're right away not making

[13:36:43 - 13:36:46]
it easy if you don't have the tutorial

[13:36:45 - 13:36:50]
from the beginning then you wouldn't

[13:36:46 - 13:36:52]
remember how to do it but somewhere in

[13:36:50 - 13:36:55]
here you would

[13:36:52 - 13:36:57]
think they would tell you the options so

[13:36:55 - 13:36:59]
now we're going to have to look it up so

[13:36:57 - 13:37:00]
I'm going to go here and just look up

[13:36:59 - 13:37:02]
cursor

[13:37:00 - 13:37:07]
hwys or maybe just go to the docs really

[13:37:02 - 13:37:10]
quickly General accounts usage

[13:37:07 - 13:37:11]
okay what are the hocky command K is one

[13:37:10 - 13:37:14]
of

[13:37:11 - 13:37:18]
them I want chat though overview cursor

[13:37:14 - 13:37:20]
chat lets you ask questions and solve

[13:37:18 - 13:37:23]
problems contrl L okay so we have

[13:37:20 - 13:37:25]
control K and contr L so we'll do contrl

[13:37:23 - 13:37:29]
L I'm not sure why it's contr l but

[13:37:25 - 13:37:30]
that's fine and notice that we can

[13:37:29 - 13:37:33]
change to whatever we want so if we

[13:37:30 - 13:37:36]
wanted to use claudon it we can right

[13:37:33 - 13:37:37]
now we're set to a cursor small to be

[13:37:36 - 13:37:41]
fair if we really wanted to compare this

[13:37:37 - 13:37:44]
we should have used this against um uh

[13:37:41 - 13:37:49]
uh whatever the model that

[13:37:44 - 13:37:51]
um uh was it uh that um codium use but

[13:37:49 - 13:37:53]
if we wanted something similar I would

[13:37:51 - 13:37:55]
imagine we just choose Cloud Sonet here

[13:37:53 - 13:37:56]
so I'll just write here you know I want

[13:37:55 - 13:37:59]
to

[13:37:56 - 13:38:01]
build I want to build but you can

[13:37:59 - 13:38:02]
already see like way more options right

[13:38:01 - 13:38:04]
tons and tons of options I just don't

[13:38:02 - 13:38:06]
like how the font is so darn small they

[13:38:04 - 13:38:09]
just assume everyone's eyes are stupidly

[13:38:06 - 13:38:11]
um like yes when I was 19 I wanted

[13:38:09 - 13:38:14]
everything small like that but folks

[13:38:11 - 13:38:20]
have some de decent sizes by default

[13:38:14 - 13:38:22]
okay so I want to build a simple uh

[13:38:20 - 13:38:27]
goang web

[13:38:22 - 13:38:31]
app that is apid driven which is a clone

[13:38:27 - 13:38:35]
of Link uh clone of Link Tre okay so

[13:38:31 - 13:38:37]
we'll go ahead and do that let's see it

[13:38:35 - 13:38:40]
go off and do some cool

[13:38:37 - 13:38:42]
things we'll zoom out a little bit

[13:38:40 - 13:38:45]
here I'm trying to zoom out while this

[13:38:42 - 13:38:45]
is going

[13:38:47 - 13:38:54]
here I'm not sure what composer

[13:38:51 - 13:38:54]
is what's the

[13:38:56 - 13:39:01]
difference and while that's going let's

[13:38:59 - 13:39:04]
go take a look at what composer could

[13:39:01 - 13:39:06]
be does it say anywhere here composer

[13:39:04 - 13:39:08]
here it is composer ER is your AI coding

[13:39:06 - 13:39:10]
system that lives in your editor it

[13:39:08 - 13:39:13]
helps explore code while write new

[13:39:10 - 13:39:15]
features and new comparisons so this

[13:39:13 - 13:39:20]
might be something that is more

[13:39:15 - 13:39:21]
comparable to um what wind surf what's

[13:39:20 - 13:39:24]
wind surf's uh whatever they called

[13:39:21 - 13:39:26]
their thing Cascade was so this is fine

[13:39:24 - 13:39:27]
but I'm going to go and I'm going to

[13:39:26 - 13:39:28]
take this and I'm going to actually try

[13:39:27 - 13:39:31]
this

[13:39:28 - 13:39:32]
again because I want to give cursor its

[13:39:31 - 13:39:35]
best chance to impress me here we're

[13:39:32 - 13:39:37]
going to go over to composer and we'll

[13:39:35 - 13:39:39]
nope that's not what I wanted we'll go

[13:39:37 - 13:39:43]
back all the way up to

[13:39:39 - 13:39:46]
here and come on copy copy copy copy

[13:39:43 - 13:39:48]
copy copy copy copy there we go and

[13:39:46 - 13:39:49]
we're going to stick with Claud Sonet

[13:39:48 - 13:39:51]
here and let's go ahead and submit again

[13:39:49 - 13:39:55]
there's also different kinds of Agents

[13:39:51 - 13:39:57]
normal oh agentic okay so I'm not sure

[13:39:55 - 13:39:59]
what the difference is we'll do

[13:39:57 - 13:40:03]
agentic so now I'm hoping that this will

[13:39:59 - 13:40:03]
do something similar to Cascade

[13:40:04 - 13:40:09]
right oh oh okay so it's really going

[13:40:07 - 13:40:10]
through the agentic process all right

[13:40:09 - 13:40:15]
that makes

[13:40:10 - 13:40:15]
sense kind of like having v0 in

[13:40:16 - 13:40:24]
place okay so we have one file here it's

[13:40:20 - 13:40:24]
still going so let's let it keep going

[13:40:31 - 13:40:35]
here okay so this is more close to Kin

[13:40:34 - 13:40:38]
with what we're looking for I'll just

[13:40:35 - 13:40:43]
accept that it's bringing gorilla MX as

[13:40:38 - 13:40:45]
well um it has kind of similar is active

[13:40:43 - 13:40:46]
link store don't like the name but

[13:40:45 - 13:40:50]
that's

[13:40:46 - 13:40:50]
fine responds with

[13:40:52 - 13:40:58]
header it's okay I

[13:40:55 - 13:41:01]
suppose is this actually

[13:40:58 - 13:41:03]
um it looks more database driven that's

[13:41:01 - 13:41:05]
for sure it's not like

[13:41:03 - 13:41:08]
staging any pretend data

[13:41:05 - 13:41:10]
we have more API endpoints so maybe some

[13:41:08 - 13:41:11]
of this agentic stuff kind of helps

[13:41:10 - 13:41:16]
we're going to go over here and just say

[13:41:11 - 13:41:20]
Okay I want to use um esql light 3 also

[13:41:16 - 13:41:25]
can you um as the

[13:41:20 - 13:41:25]
database also can you uh create a readme

[13:41:26 - 13:41:35]
file which has um a bash

[13:41:30 - 13:41:35]
command to seed the database

[13:41:36 - 13:41:39]
so we'll go ahead and give it

[13:41:40 - 13:41:45]
that what I think I kind of Wonder while

[13:41:42 - 13:41:48]
we're doing this if I right click

[13:41:45 - 13:41:49]
here no I was soing like I really like

[13:41:48 - 13:41:51]
that cont that context menu when you

[13:41:49 - 13:41:55]
right click and you can choose options

[13:41:51 - 13:41:55]
that the other editors have

[13:41:55 - 13:42:01]
um so it's it's like hard it's like

[13:41:58 - 13:42:03]
there's things I like an Amazon

[13:42:01 - 13:42:05]
developer Q or Amazon Q developer but I

[13:42:03 - 13:42:07]
also just like that this is happening

[13:42:05 - 13:42:09]
and is working correctly last time I

[13:42:07 - 13:42:12]
used cursor it didn't have this composer

[13:42:09 - 13:42:13]
mode and it kind of dumped things in

[13:42:12 - 13:42:15]
places that I didn't want it was very

[13:42:13 - 13:42:17]
frustrating I think it was like the live

[13:42:15 - 13:42:20]
coding that was really annoying for me

[13:42:17 - 13:42:24]
so here we can go ahead and review it

[13:42:20 - 13:42:28]
quickly that's cool um database

[13:42:24 - 13:42:28]
SQL nitb looks

[13:42:28 - 13:42:34]
fine um okay that looks fine

[13:42:35 - 13:42:38]
sure we'll accept the

[13:42:41 - 13:42:45]
changes and I guess I'll accept the read

[13:42:43 - 13:42:48]
me as well I'm not sure that that seems

[13:42:45 - 13:42:49]
okay and so we do have some steps that

[13:42:48 - 13:42:52]
we do need to perform because it didn't

[13:42:49 - 13:42:54]
create our um that one file there that

[13:42:52 - 13:42:58]
we should have it's the go and what is

[13:42:54 - 13:42:58]
it it's go and

[13:43:00 - 13:43:07]
nit I can't remember what it is it's how

[13:43:03 - 13:43:07]
do I initialize

[13:43:07 - 13:43:13]
my uh go

[13:43:10 - 13:43:13]
dood

[13:43:14 - 13:43:19]
file I can't remember what it is like go

[13:43:17 - 13:43:22]
in It Go mod in it or

[13:43:19 - 13:43:24]
something I it just created it for me so

[13:43:22 - 13:43:27]
that that's good as well so I guess I

[13:43:24 - 13:43:28]
I'll accept that it also took took in

[13:43:27 - 13:43:30]
some versions probably would have been

[13:43:28 - 13:43:32]
better to run them because we'd get a a

[13:43:30 - 13:43:36]
much newer version here but that looks

[13:43:32 - 13:43:40]
fine let's go ahead and type in go

[13:43:36 - 13:43:42]
oops go run main.go

[13:43:40 - 13:43:44]
oh we're not in the correct directory so

[13:43:42 - 13:43:48]
I'm going to curse I go into cursor in

[13:43:44 - 13:43:48]
the link tree it we'll say gun main.go

[13:43:50 - 13:43:54]
so we'll see if that starts

[13:44:00 - 13:44:07]
up and we'll give it a second

[13:44:04 - 13:44:10]
here be back in just a moment all right

[13:44:07 - 13:44:14]
so it says module requires go 116 this

[13:44:10 - 13:44:17]
is an issue we've seen before

[13:44:14 - 13:44:19]
um let's just have it corrected our uh

[13:44:17 - 13:44:22]
have it corrected for us here we'll go

[13:44:19 - 13:44:24]
ahead and do this and oh my goodness I

[13:44:22 - 13:44:24]
hate when my keyboard does that my keys

[13:44:24 - 13:44:28]
just

[13:44:24 - 13:44:29]
stick and I'm not sure what it's doing

[13:44:28 - 13:44:31]
now I just totally accept what it

[13:44:29 - 13:44:33]
already had

[13:44:31 - 13:44:35]
here okay okay just cancel this cancel

[13:44:33 - 13:44:38]
this I don't want that um let's go ahead

[13:44:35 - 13:44:40]
and I'll just tell this

[13:44:38 - 13:44:41]
here I already accepted the file so I'm

[13:44:40 - 13:44:45]
not

[13:44:41 - 13:44:47]
sure this is where again I don't like

[13:44:45 - 13:44:49]
cursor's interface like it's it's taking

[13:44:47 - 13:44:49]
these commands here let me just undo

[13:44:49 - 13:44:52]
here

[13:44:49 - 13:44:56]
undo all I wanted to do was copy this

[13:44:52 - 13:44:56]
part and then paste it

[13:44:56 - 13:45:02]
in just say reject I'm hoping that

[13:44:58 - 13:45:02]
didn't uh undo those files

[13:45:07 - 13:45:11]
okay problem with

[13:45:16 - 13:45:21]
go okay so we'll go ahead and accept

[13:45:19 - 13:45:22]
that it just changed the version I'm not

[13:45:21 - 13:45:24]
sure if it changed the esite version as

[13:45:22 - 13:45:26]
well but I guess we'll find out is it

[13:45:24 - 13:45:29]
still

[13:45:26 - 13:45:29]
generating okay

[13:45:31 - 13:45:38]
accept and

[13:45:35 - 13:45:40]
I guess it's like running stuff for me

[13:45:38 - 13:45:42]
okay great can I now do the stuff that I

[13:45:40 - 13:45:44]
want to do there we go and let's see if

[13:45:42 - 13:45:45]
it builds this time if that's the issue

[13:45:44 - 13:45:48]
then it's going to be the go ESU light

[13:45:45 - 13:45:48]
version that we'll have to

[13:45:50 - 13:45:54]
tweak we will give this a moment to do

[13:45:52 - 13:45:56]
whatever it needs to do all right so

[13:45:54 - 13:45:59]
that didn't exactly fix our problem I'm

[13:45:56 - 13:45:59]
going to I guess try

[13:46:00 - 13:46:05]
again same

[13:46:03 - 13:46:06]
problem okay now we're just wasting our

[13:46:05 - 13:46:08]
credits here trying to figure this out

[13:46:06 - 13:46:11]
but

[13:46:08 - 13:46:13]
um now it's tried to change the version

[13:46:11 - 13:46:14]
okay so I'm not sure if it's just gone

[13:46:13 - 13:46:16]
down a version that's going to help but

[13:46:14 - 13:46:17]
we'll see here I'm just waiting here to

[13:46:16 - 13:46:20]
see if there's anything else I have to

[13:46:17 - 13:46:23]
do maybe go go mod tidy something we

[13:46:20 - 13:46:23]
should do go mod

[13:46:23 - 13:46:27]
tidy go mod main

[13:46:30 - 13:46:35]
go go run mango sorry

[13:46:36 - 13:46:40]
and so we are getting into better shape

[13:46:38 - 13:46:43]
here however I'm running something on

[13:46:40 - 13:46:45]
Port 880 it's probably from

[13:46:43 - 13:46:47]
codium there we go so I'll just close

[13:46:45 - 13:46:50]
out codium or wind surf we should say

[13:46:47 - 13:46:52]
wind Surf and we'll go back and hit up

[13:46:50 - 13:46:54]
and now we will attempt to run this

[13:46:52 - 13:46:55]
again this is now

[13:46:54 - 13:47:00]
8080

[13:46:55 - 13:47:02]
um and I'm going to go over to here and

[13:47:00 - 13:47:04]
we'll take a look here

[13:47:02 - 13:47:07]
8080 it'd be fun to have a little front

[13:47:04 - 13:47:10]
content uh just because this is in

[13:47:07 - 13:47:12]
cursor and I want to compare it even

[13:47:10 - 13:47:17]
closer to wind surf cuz like can you

[13:47:12 - 13:47:21]
create a uh front end for this

[13:47:17 - 13:47:21]
app I think that' just be nice to have

[13:47:28 - 13:47:32]
it okay so it looks like it's doing

[13:47:30 - 13:47:34]
something

[13:47:32 - 13:47:36]
similar I just don't know why cursor

[13:47:34 - 13:47:39]
sorry codium was able to do in one go in

[13:47:36 - 13:47:41]
this one I have to ask it but maybe if I

[13:47:39 - 13:47:43]
I did these things a few more times we

[13:47:41 - 13:47:45]
would find out for certain I'm going to

[13:47:43 - 13:47:46]
go accept that stuff assuming it was I

[13:47:45 - 13:47:48]
guess it wasn't done it's interesting

[13:47:46 - 13:47:49]
that I can accept it even though it's

[13:47:48 - 13:47:53]
not

[13:47:49 - 13:47:53]
done but I guess we'll wait a little bit

[13:47:57 - 13:48:02]
here as you can probably tell I'm not a

[13:47:59 - 13:48:04]
fan of

[13:48:02 - 13:48:08]
cursor uh like it's fine it's like it's

[13:48:04 - 13:48:08]
doing what it's supposed to be doing but

[13:48:10 - 13:48:15]
uh oh my goodness this just goes and

[13:48:15 - 13:48:21]
goes what how much stuff are you making

[13:48:19 - 13:48:23]
here oh it's a making a mid panel okay I

[13:48:21 - 13:48:26]
should not complain maybe maybe we'll

[13:48:23 - 13:48:26]
get something cool

[13:48:33 - 13:48:36]
here still going

[13:48:38 - 13:48:41]
this one's a hard

[13:48:44 - 13:48:50]
worker I'm gonna pause until it's

[13:48:47 - 13:48:52]
done all right so I think it's done

[13:48:50 - 13:48:54]
we're going to just accept the

[13:48:52 - 13:48:56]
changes and so now we have a front end

[13:48:54 - 13:48:58]
I'm going to stop the app I'm going to

[13:48:56 - 13:49:00]
start it again hopefully it still works

[13:48:58 - 13:49:02]
um though we didn't really test it in

[13:49:00 - 13:49:04]
its full capacity here um I'm also going

[13:49:02 - 13:49:06]
to seat it with data assuming it gave us

[13:49:04 - 13:49:09]
a seat example I think I asked it to do

[13:49:06 - 13:49:10]
that for us here uh yep so we have an

[13:49:09 - 13:49:13]
example here so I'm going to go ahead

[13:49:10 - 13:49:15]
and copy

[13:49:13 - 13:49:16]
this and we'll paste that in here we'll

[13:49:15 - 13:49:20]
hit

[13:49:16 - 13:49:22]
enter no such table

[13:49:20 - 13:49:24]
links because I was hoping you'd make

[13:49:22 - 13:49:26]
the table maybe this thing uh maybe in

[13:49:24 - 13:49:28]
the code it makes the table for

[13:49:26 - 13:49:31]
us we actually do have a table it's

[13:49:28 - 13:49:33]
right here you know what the problem is

[13:49:31 - 13:49:35]
it's me I'm in the wrong

[13:49:33 - 13:49:37]
place okay when we first started that

[13:49:35 - 13:49:39]
app it probably created the table and

[13:49:37 - 13:49:41]
seated it there so go ahead and hit

[13:49:39 - 13:49:42]
enter so now that data should be in

[13:49:41 - 13:49:44]
there I'm not going to check I'm going

[13:49:42 - 13:49:47]
to assume that that worked and I'm going

[13:49:44 - 13:49:50]
to save all files it looks like some

[13:49:47 - 13:49:51]
files no maybe they are saved I thought

[13:49:50 - 13:49:53]
maybe there's some here that aren't

[13:49:51 - 13:49:55]
saved because of the these circles but I

[13:49:53 - 13:49:57]
just might be uh not sure what I'm

[13:49:55 - 13:50:01]
looking at here okay so now let's go

[13:49:57 - 13:50:01]
take a look at the app and see if it

[13:50:01 - 13:50:06]
works that looks really good

[13:50:04 - 13:50:08]
okay that's actually pretty good let's

[13:50:06 - 13:50:14]
go to the mid panel see what we can

[13:50:08 - 13:50:19]
do so we'll say exam Pro Training Inc

[13:50:14 - 13:50:22]
htps www. exampro doco add the

[13:50:19 - 13:50:24]
link I mean it added the link so that

[13:50:22 - 13:50:29]
was pretty good we go back over to here

[13:50:24 - 13:50:31]
we have our clone so it works it's fine

[13:50:29 - 13:50:33]
um I don't know I guess it did what it

[13:50:31 - 13:50:36]
said it would do

[13:50:33 - 13:50:39]
um I still think that probably I could

[13:50:36 - 13:50:41]
get this to work with codium um but yeah

[13:50:39 - 13:50:43]
I guess it's fine I just don't like the

[13:50:41 - 13:50:46]
UI and the waiting around but the agenta

[13:50:43 - 13:50:50]
coding was was pretty good um is this

[13:50:46 - 13:50:53]
better than something than let's say

[13:50:50 - 13:50:57]
um what do you call it

[13:50:53 - 13:50:59]
uh lovable or let's say versel zero I

[13:50:57 - 13:51:02]
don't know like versel ver cels vers

[13:50:59 - 13:51:05]
vzer seems like it's really focused on

[13:51:02 - 13:51:07]
xjs so I feel like if that's your your

[13:51:05 - 13:51:09]
what you'd like to code in then probably

[13:51:07 - 13:51:11]
that's what you utilize lovable is more

[13:51:09 - 13:51:13]
tuned for super base I haven't really

[13:51:11 - 13:51:16]
tried generating a back ends with it but

[13:51:13 - 13:51:17]
these tools like cursor and codium um

[13:51:16 - 13:51:19]
definitely seem like they can handle

[13:51:17 - 13:51:21]
back ends and front ends pretty well we

[13:51:19 - 13:51:22]
didn't really give Amazon developer que

[13:51:21 - 13:51:24]
a chance to make a front end so it could

[13:51:22 - 13:51:26]
have done an okay job um but yeah you

[13:51:24 - 13:51:28]
can see that there's variance of here of

[13:51:26 - 13:51:31]
all these things and so I don't know not

[13:51:28 - 13:51:33]
sure what to say but if you really want

[13:51:31 - 13:51:35]
you can install all of these things and

[13:51:33 - 13:51:36]
then use all the free compute until you

[13:51:35 - 13:51:37]
get something working which is

[13:51:36 - 13:51:40]
interesting but we'll call this video

[13:51:37 - 13:51:44]
done and I'll see you in the next one

[13:51:40 - 13:51:45]
[Music]

[13:51:44 - 13:51:47]
okay all right let's take a look at

[13:51:45 - 13:51:50]
source graph Cody I didn't even know

[13:51:47 - 13:51:51]
about this but uh my friend Kirk on

[13:51:50 - 13:51:53]
Twitter was like hey did you not check

[13:51:51 - 13:51:55]
this out and so I figured well let's

[13:51:53 - 13:51:58]
give it a go as I don't know if it's

[13:51:55 - 13:52:01]
open source but it seems like it's just

[13:51:58 - 13:52:02]
another one that we can utilize it's

[13:52:01 - 13:52:03]
interesting there's a virt oh it's a

[13:52:02 - 13:52:05]
virtual code AI Summit that's a bit

[13:52:03 - 13:52:09]
silly let's let's go ahead and connect

[13:52:05 - 13:52:09]
with um

[13:52:10 - 13:52:16]
Google and let's see what this thing is

[13:52:12 - 13:52:17]
all about um there's a different tool

[13:52:16 - 13:52:19]
every other day here but interested to

[13:52:17 - 13:52:21]
see how we have so here we can install

[13:52:19 - 13:52:25]
it into vs code I mean that's how I want

[13:52:21 - 13:52:29]
to use it um upgrade unlimited etc etc

[13:52:25 - 13:52:33]
let's go ahead and install that into vs

[13:52:29 - 13:52:36]
code okay and so over here we have Cody

[13:52:33 - 13:52:38]
we're going to go and install it and

[13:52:36 - 13:52:41]
close this out here as we did have

[13:52:38 - 13:52:44]
Gemini goodbye Gemini you are the worst

[13:52:41 - 13:52:46]
of the worst Gemini I'm so sorry and so

[13:52:44 - 13:52:48]
AI that uses your code Bas as context

[13:52:46 - 13:52:49]
Cody is an AI assistant coding assistant

[13:52:48 - 13:52:52]
that helps you understand rate code

[13:52:49 - 13:52:55]
faster you can choose between gp24 and

[13:52:52 - 13:52:57]
Claude Sonet sounds a lot like the other

[13:52:55 - 13:52:58]
two oh look at that interface over there

[13:52:57 - 13:52:59]
that looks really exciting so we're

[13:52:58 - 13:53:01]
going to find out here pretty close

[13:52:59 - 13:53:04]
we're going to go ahead and sign in and

[13:53:01 - 13:53:05]
see if we can get in here um I use uh

[13:53:04 - 13:53:07]
Google so I'm going to make sure I

[13:53:05 - 13:53:09]
connect with Google here so that my life

[13:53:07 - 13:53:11]
is super easy we're going to go ahead

[13:53:09 - 13:53:13]
and authorize the vs code extension

[13:53:11 - 13:53:16]
we're going to go back over to vs code

[13:53:13 - 13:53:18]
we'll hit open again and I believe now

[13:53:16 - 13:53:21]
we should be

[13:53:18 - 13:53:23]
enabled there we go and it's saying

[13:53:21 - 13:53:25]
jingi Essentials now technically we

[13:53:23 - 13:53:27]
really want to be specific to a specific

[13:53:25 - 13:53:29]
repo but hey if it picks up on all the

[13:53:27 - 13:53:31]
other stuff that's great for it we have

[13:53:29 - 13:53:33]
document code explain code find code

[13:53:31 - 13:53:36]
smells generate unit test this is

[13:53:33 - 13:53:39]
looking a lot more similar to Amazon

[13:53:36 - 13:53:41]
developer Q in terms of the stuff um I

[13:53:39 - 13:53:43]
really want to be specific in terms of

[13:53:41 - 13:53:44]
what I add but I'm not sure how to

[13:53:43 - 13:53:48]
change this

[13:53:44 - 13:53:51]
so I guess I can't easily let's go ahead

[13:53:48 - 13:53:54]
and just drag can I drag this can I move

[13:53:51 - 13:53:55]
this can I move this window let's move

[13:53:54 - 13:53:56]
it here to the right I'm just kind of

[13:53:55 - 13:53:59]
getting used to things being on the

[13:53:56 - 13:54:00]
right here get out of here Gemini I

[13:53:59 - 13:54:03]
thought we got rid of this let's go

[13:54:00 - 13:54:06]
ahead and give this a Reload so we do

[13:54:03 - 13:54:06]
not see Gemini anymore

[13:54:06 - 13:54:10]
we'll close all of these out here I'm

[13:54:08 - 13:54:12]
going to make a new folder on the left

[13:54:10 - 13:54:15]
hand side I'm going to

[13:54:12 - 13:54:18]
whoops I'm TR why this is just hanging

[13:54:15 - 13:54:19]
out over here in the loose we delete

[13:54:18 - 13:54:21]
that out of

[13:54:19 - 13:54:24]
there that's okay that's okay we'll go

[13:54:21 - 13:54:27]
ahead and make a new one this will be

[13:54:24 - 13:54:29]
Cod and I'm going to make a new folder

[13:54:27 - 13:54:32]
here called is that a folder or file new

[13:54:29 - 13:54:34]
folder link

[13:54:32 - 13:54:36]
tree I mean if they're all using plots

[13:54:34 - 13:54:40]
on it they're all going to perform

[13:54:36 - 13:54:43]
adequately the same uh main.go

[13:54:40 - 13:54:44]
uh Cody what's going on here okay great

[13:54:43 - 13:54:48]
so now it's in the context of main.go

[13:54:44 - 13:54:51]
which is great I want

[13:54:48 - 13:54:53]
to start generating some code here so we

[13:54:51 - 13:54:56]
got

[13:54:53 - 13:54:59]
prompts PL

[13:54:56 - 13:55:01]
Sonet oh we got a lot of options even

[13:54:59 - 13:55:03]
mistol I I think this is the one with

[13:55:01 - 13:55:04]
the most most options I've seen so far

[13:55:03 - 13:55:07]
this is really nice obviously Claud

[13:55:04 - 13:55:11]
Sonet is very popular so we'll go ahead

[13:55:07 - 13:55:13]
here and say I would like to um I want

[13:55:11 - 13:55:18]
to build

[13:55:13 - 13:55:22]
a a link tree clone uh using

[13:55:18 - 13:55:24]
goang uh using

[13:55:22 - 13:55:26]
goang

[13:55:24 - 13:55:28]
and SQL

[13:55:26 - 13:55:30]
light three I'm working a little bit

[13:55:28 - 13:55:36]
different here

[13:55:30 - 13:55:36]
so but let's Let it go ahead and do that

[13:55:39 - 13:55:43]
okay and so we have chat here I thought

[13:55:41 - 13:55:45]
I would like insert stuff or do

[13:55:43 - 13:55:47]
something there um I guess it's not

[13:55:45 - 13:55:49]
agentic at least the way I'm looking at

[13:55:47 - 13:55:50]
it I don't see any agentic stuff here

[13:55:49 - 13:55:53]
Cody

[13:55:50 - 13:55:55]
commands new chat edit code document

[13:55:53 - 13:55:58]
code explain code generate test very

[13:55:55 - 13:56:00]
similar to Amazon Q developer

[13:55:58 - 13:56:03]
interesting

[13:56:00 - 13:56:04]
um again I'd like it to just insert the

[13:56:03 - 13:56:06]
code at this point just because all the

[13:56:04 - 13:56:08]
other ones

[13:56:06 - 13:56:11]
do well let's just hit apply okay we'll

[13:56:08 - 13:56:13]
hit apply okay so it does do it and we

[13:56:11 - 13:56:16]
accept it

[13:56:13 - 13:56:18]
again and then we go to the next one

[13:56:16 - 13:56:21]
we'll say

[13:56:18 - 13:56:22]
execute hopefully it um it's running in

[13:56:21 - 13:56:26]
the correct context

[13:56:22 - 13:56:29]
here confirm and run

[13:56:26 - 13:56:30]
yes now this is not in the right place

[13:56:29 - 13:56:33]
so it didn't know to go to the right

[13:56:30 - 13:56:35]
place so we have to help it out here and

[13:56:33 - 13:56:37]
we'll try this again Cody link

[13:56:35 - 13:56:40]
tree I'm going to just switch them both

[13:56:37 - 13:56:40]
over so we're not getting confused

[13:56:42 - 13:56:46]
here all right and so we'll go ahead and

[13:56:44 - 13:56:49]
try this

[13:56:46 - 13:56:51]
again I would say I like I like the UI

[13:56:49 - 13:56:53]
here it's pretty nice so now it should

[13:56:51 - 13:56:55]
have that file in here does it let's

[13:56:53 - 13:56:58]
give this a refresh there we go we got a

[13:56:55 - 13:57:00]
go mod we will execute

[13:56:58 - 13:57:02]
that it kind of feels like I'm doing the

[13:57:00 - 13:57:04]
work too like it's not and I mean that

[13:57:02 - 13:57:07]
in a good way like I know what's going

[13:57:04 - 13:57:09]
on here um then we have run go I'm

[13:57:07 - 13:57:11]
really surprised that's all we need

[13:57:09 - 13:57:13]
maybe that's all we need right this

[13:57:11 - 13:57:15]
isn't using um

[13:57:13 - 13:57:19]
gorilla now it is making the link tree.

[13:57:15 - 13:57:20]
DB which is fine um it is creating the

[13:57:19 - 13:57:23]
database not exactly how I'd like to do

[13:57:20 - 13:57:25]
it that's totally fine

[13:57:23 - 13:57:28]
um I don't really want to start it right

[13:57:25 - 13:57:32]
away it's say okay can you also code uh

[13:57:28 - 13:57:32]
a front end for me

[13:57:37 - 13:57:42]
so I wonder if it will know how to do

[13:57:39 - 13:57:44]
that yeah so here it says index HTML but

[13:57:42 - 13:57:46]
where is it going to stick it is what I

[13:57:44 - 13:57:49]
wonder also look at the file over here

[13:57:46 - 13:57:51]
it's in the wrong location I need this

[13:57:49 - 13:57:56]
to be

[13:57:51 - 13:57:58]
in this folder here so I'll move that

[13:57:56 - 13:58:00]
here uh well hold on a

[13:57:58 - 13:58:02]
second yeah yeah yeah so this is the

[13:58:00 - 13:58:05]
code that it just generated I

[13:58:02 - 13:58:07]
believe it is and so this is not in the

[13:58:05 - 13:58:08]
right directory so we'll move that there

[13:58:07 - 13:58:10]
say

[13:58:08 - 13:58:12]
replace

[13:58:10 - 13:58:15]
and I mean I do want

[13:58:12 - 13:58:18]
this but where's it going to

[13:58:15 - 13:58:20]
go okay so not putting it in where I

[13:58:18 - 13:58:22]
want it to be there probably is a way to

[13:58:20 - 13:58:24]
help it contextually know where to stick

[13:58:22 - 13:58:26]
things but because right now it's set up

[13:58:24 - 13:58:28]
here and I'm again I'm not sure how to

[13:58:26 - 13:58:28]
change

[13:58:31 - 13:58:37]
this current Repository

[13:58:34 - 13:58:40]
yeah so it's not like it's a per folder

[13:58:37 - 13:58:41]
kind of thing it's very specific to that

[13:58:40 - 13:58:43]
I mean as long as the code works that

[13:58:41 - 13:58:45]
that's all that

[13:58:43 - 13:58:48]
matters wouldn't it have to change some

[13:58:45 - 13:58:48]
of the

[13:58:48 - 13:58:53]
um the front like how's it going to

[13:58:50 - 13:58:53]
serve

[13:58:56 - 13:59:04]
it would it know to serve that okay like

[13:58:59 - 13:59:05]
how is it going to serve the static page

[13:59:04 - 13:59:07]
oh no right here it's already there okay

[13:59:05 - 13:59:09]
so maybe it already updated it okay so

[13:59:07 - 13:59:12]
we have

[13:59:09 - 13:59:14]
index.html um you know can I can I get a

[13:59:12 - 13:59:14]
read

[13:59:15 - 13:59:23]
me of a um bash

[13:59:18 - 13:59:26]
command to seed the

[13:59:23 - 13:59:28]
database okay and while we're getting

[13:59:26 - 13:59:32]
that I'm going to go ahead and let's go

[13:59:28 - 13:59:37]
try to start this up so we have go

[13:59:32 - 13:59:37]
run run main.go

[13:59:38 - 13:59:43]
oh there's

[13:59:41 - 13:59:46]
um what do you mean expected package

[13:59:43 - 13:59:49]
it's right there is it not we go here

[13:59:46 - 13:59:49]
package main

[13:59:50 - 13:59:55]
right try this again go run main

[13:59:55 - 14:00:01]
go oh the same things are undefined oh

[14:00:00 - 14:00:04]
interesting

[14:00:01 - 14:00:07]
um okay so we'll make a new file here

[14:00:04 - 14:00:07]
called readme.md

[14:00:07 - 14:00:11]
and in here we do have a bash command so

[14:00:09 - 14:00:14]
we'll go ahead and paste it here like

[14:00:11 - 14:00:17]
this I guess I did say like bash command

[14:00:14 - 14:00:19]
but I didn't say a file I said can I get

[14:00:17 - 14:00:22]
a read me like put it in the readme

[14:00:19 - 14:00:25]
that's not what it did also this file is

[14:00:22 - 14:00:28]
incomplete go back to this

[14:00:25 - 14:00:31]
one so go tell this here like these

[14:00:28 - 14:00:31]
things are

[14:00:31 - 14:00:37]
missing it says there's no context fetch

[14:00:33 - 14:00:37]
so because I moved the file now it's

[14:00:38 - 14:00:43]
confused okay so now I just feel like

[14:00:40 - 14:00:45]
I'm using claudon it which is fine Clon

[14:00:43 - 14:00:47]
is good but now I have to do the work to

[14:00:45 - 14:00:48]
put it in the right place and so this is

[14:00:47 - 14:00:49]
where I'm going to stop because I kind

[14:00:48 - 14:00:52]
of feel

[14:00:49 - 14:00:54]
like I mean we can bring them over here

[14:00:52 - 14:00:56]
and just dump them in but I'm starting

[14:00:54 - 14:00:58]
to feel like this is not uh doing what I

[14:00:56 - 14:01:00]
want it to do and now I'm doing more of

[14:00:58 - 14:01:02]
the work let's go ahead and run

[14:01:00 - 14:01:05]
this you know what I mean so I got to go

[14:01:02 - 14:01:07]
here and say okay now need time now I'm

[14:01:05 - 14:01:10]
just I might as well just be using CLA

[14:01:07 - 14:01:10]
separate from here and copy and pasting

[14:01:11 - 14:01:16]
in yeah yeah okay so we're going to call

[14:01:13 - 14:01:20]
this done um I'm going to say Cody is

[14:01:16 - 14:01:22]
okay but it's um not really doing what I

[14:01:20 - 14:01:25]
wanted to do but the problem is that I'm

[14:01:22 - 14:01:26]
working within a folder of a repo so

[14:01:25 - 14:01:29]
maybe it would have an easier time if it

[14:01:26 - 14:01:30]
was the top level repo but it doesn't

[14:01:29 - 14:01:33]
seem to be as sophisticated as something

[14:01:30 - 14:01:34]
like codium or cursor whatever they're

[14:01:33 - 14:01:36]
doing under the h

[14:01:34 - 14:01:40]
with if it's agentic workflows or things

[14:01:36 - 14:01:41]
like that um but anyway some of the

[14:01:40 - 14:01:44]
experience was a little bit nice there

[14:01:41 - 14:01:45]
but just not enough to uh be worth our

[14:01:44 - 14:01:49]
time

[14:01:45 - 14:01:51]
[Music]

[14:01:49 - 14:01:52]
okay hey this is Andrew Brown this video

[14:01:51 - 14:01:54]
we're going to take a look at stackpack

[14:01:52 - 14:01:55]
which is a way to generate out things

[14:01:54 - 14:01:58]
like infrastructures code and other

[14:01:55 - 14:02:00]
things I I know this originally for it

[14:01:58 - 14:02:02]
Genera out IAC specifically terraform

[14:02:00 - 14:02:04]
but I do believe since I last looked at

[14:02:02 - 14:02:07]
it that they're extending into to uh

[14:02:04 - 14:02:10]
agentic models for building or to write

[14:02:07 - 14:02:12]
out your devops code for a various

[14:02:10 - 14:02:14]
amount of Frameworks I believe this is a

[14:02:12 - 14:02:16]
new feature so it's not 100% done so

[14:02:14 - 14:02:18]
we're just going to focus on its core

[14:02:16 - 14:02:19]
functionality let's go take a look here

[14:02:18 - 14:02:22]
and see what we

[14:02:19 - 14:02:24]
have so I'm just going to go over here

[14:02:22 - 14:02:26]
to uh I've already made an account

[14:02:24 - 14:02:27]
there's you can make a free account here

[14:02:26 - 14:02:29]
but I guess we have to go ahead and

[14:02:27 - 14:02:31]
create our first flow UI might be a

[14:02:29 - 14:02:32]
little bit different based on what

[14:02:31 - 14:02:34]
you're doing but I'm going to go ahead

[14:02:32 - 14:02:37]
and just say my simple flow notice that

[14:02:34 - 14:02:39]
these are public right now so um other

[14:02:37 - 14:02:40]
people might see what we're generating

[14:02:39 - 14:02:42]
out here on the left hand side we can

[14:02:40 - 14:02:43]
drop down and change what we want to

[14:02:42 - 14:02:47]
generate out whether it's GitHub actions

[14:02:43 - 14:02:49]
Docker file kubernetes or terraform um

[14:02:47 - 14:02:52]
or we have these three options we have

[14:02:49 - 14:02:53]
generate and modify and ask and so you

[14:02:52 - 14:02:56]
know if we want to generate a ter form

[14:02:53 - 14:03:01]
we can do that and so I might say um I

[14:02:56 - 14:03:04]
want to deploy a rails app to

[14:03:01 - 14:03:06]
AWS um using ec2

[14:03:04 - 14:03:08]
and we'll go ahead and enter and so

[14:03:06 - 14:03:10]
that's going to generate out some code

[14:03:08 - 14:03:11]
for us and we'll wait here just a moment

[14:03:10 - 14:03:13]
this project is really interesting

[14:03:11 - 14:03:16]
because uh George actually will be end

[14:03:13 - 14:03:18]
up talking to him in the ji boot camp

[14:03:16 - 14:03:20]
and he's going to share with us his

[14:03:18 - 14:03:22]
wealth of knowledge in terms of uh

[14:03:20 - 14:03:24]
structured structured generation and uh

[14:03:22 - 14:03:26]
agentic workflows um the approach that

[14:03:24 - 14:03:27]
he takes to building this stuff is

[14:03:26 - 14:03:29]
really really interesting that's one

[14:03:27 - 14:03:31]
reason why I wanted to show this product

[14:03:29 - 14:03:33]
off as we will actually be talking to

[14:03:31 - 14:03:35]
the creator of it um but here we can see

[14:03:33 - 14:03:38]
that it's ads ads region instance type

[14:03:35 - 14:03:40]
key pair Security Group IM roll things

[14:03:38 - 14:03:44]
like that um we have a security group

[14:03:40 - 14:03:45]
set up here we have an IM roll and so

[14:03:44 - 14:03:46]
it's pretty straightforward in terms of

[14:03:45 - 14:03:48]
what is going on here it's choosing

[14:03:46 - 14:03:52]
Amazon

[14:03:48 - 14:03:54]
Linux two which is fine uh you know I

[14:03:52 - 14:03:56]
might want 2023 here but again it's

[14:03:54 - 14:03:58]
based on the knowledge of what it can

[14:03:56 - 14:04:00]
pull at that time but here we have some

[14:03:58 - 14:04:01]
basic instructions for setting up a ruby

[14:04:00 - 14:04:03]
app and that looks pretty much right to

[14:04:01 - 14:04:05]
me U I'm not going to go through the

[14:04:03 - 14:04:08]
whole shebang to deploy this but if you

[14:04:05 - 14:04:11]
are looking for an i tool specifically

[14:04:08 - 14:04:14]
intended for I this one is really good

[14:04:11 - 14:04:16]
um my difficulty has always been trying

[14:04:14 - 14:04:18]
to use the generic ones to generate IC

[14:04:16 - 14:04:21]
um one uh hard part has always been

[14:04:18 - 14:04:24]
terraform to Google Cloud um or even OS

[14:04:21 - 14:04:26]
using Amazon uh developer Q in the past

[14:04:24 - 14:04:28]
has not or Amazon Q developer has not

[14:04:26 - 14:04:31]
been consistent so this is a specialized

[14:04:28 - 14:04:32]
tool for I um if you are looking for

[14:04:31 - 14:04:35]
something there but just playing around

[14:04:32 - 14:04:37]
with it get an idea of what that is um

[14:04:35 - 14:04:40]
it might be useful for you to look at

[14:04:37 - 14:04:43]
[Music]

[14:04:40 - 14:04:45]
okay hey this is angre brown and we are

[14:04:43 - 14:04:48]
taking a look at v0 which is uh a

[14:04:45 - 14:04:52]
product by versell to rapidly um well

[14:04:48 - 14:04:54]
rapidly build out um

[14:04:52 - 14:04:56]
applications uh I would say that I

[14:04:54 - 14:04:58]
wouldn't call it an end to end solution

[14:04:56 - 14:05:01]
but it's it's pretty darn good in terms

[14:04:58 - 14:05:02]
of uh building things what what I want

[14:05:01 - 14:05:03]
to do here is I'm just going to keep

[14:05:02 - 14:05:06]
using the same example that I'm using

[14:05:03 - 14:05:11]
the app prototyping it's like build me a

[14:05:06 - 14:05:15]
clone of um build me a clone of Link

[14:05:11 - 14:05:18]
tree I should be able to set a tiny

[14:05:15 - 14:05:20]
profile and a few links uh please code

[14:05:18 - 14:05:21]
me a back end now I've never actually

[14:05:20 - 14:05:23]
asked it to do a backend I always

[14:05:21 - 14:05:24]
usually have it for frontend code but

[14:05:23 - 14:05:26]
since this is a for sale product I'm

[14:05:24 - 14:05:29]
hoping that it will produce whatever the

[14:05:26 - 14:05:30]
framework is nextjs um but we'll see

[14:05:29 - 14:05:32]
what it produces and hopefully I don't

[14:05:30 - 14:05:34]
run out of my free tier while working

[14:05:32 - 14:05:37]
through this um but we will wait and see

[14:05:34 - 14:05:41]
what it produces

[14:05:37 - 14:05:41]
okay so there it goes it's

[14:05:41 - 14:05:45]
writing okay so far it's doing

[14:05:43 - 14:05:46]
placeholder content which is not exactly

[14:05:45 - 14:05:48]
what I want I do like that I can see the

[14:05:46 - 14:05:50]
structure of what I have here on the Le

[14:05:48 - 14:05:53]
hand side and it is separating things

[14:05:50 - 14:05:55]
out into Data so it it appears to be

[14:05:53 - 14:05:57]
using I think

[14:05:55 - 14:06:00]
nextjs again I'm not super uh familiar

[14:05:57 - 14:06:02]
with nextjs but um liking it really so

[14:06:00 - 14:06:04]
far the last time I used this it wasn't

[14:06:02 - 14:06:06]
as detailed it just like generate

[14:06:04 - 14:06:09]
individual components but right now it's

[14:06:06 - 14:06:09]
doing a good

[14:06:11 - 14:06:15]
job okay and we got another one here

[14:06:13 - 14:06:18]
profile it looks like it's hitting API

[14:06:15 - 14:06:18]
profile that looks

[14:06:23 - 14:06:29]
goodh is it still ring at the bottom

[14:06:25 - 14:06:31]
there we go dation class creates a basic

[14:06:29 - 14:06:34]
uh link tree clone with the following

[14:06:31 - 14:06:37]
here display user info things like this

[14:06:34 - 14:06:38]
add authentication to so only people can

[14:06:37 - 14:06:40]
uh have that add more styling but the

[14:06:38 - 14:06:42]
question is does this actually use I

[14:06:40 - 14:06:43]
really like this toggle here but does

[14:06:42 - 14:06:45]
this actually

[14:06:43 - 14:06:50]
use

[14:06:45 - 14:06:53]
um some kind of backend because this is

[14:06:50 - 14:06:56]
Json here right that it's loading which

[14:06:53 - 14:06:59]
is fine and if we go into our

[14:06:56 - 14:07:02]
routes we have a get

[14:06:59 - 14:07:05]
request yeah this is a next server so

[14:07:02 - 14:07:05]
this is a next server request

[14:07:05 - 14:07:11]
data okay I would say it's not persisted

[14:07:09 - 14:07:13]
per se because it is just referencing

[14:07:11 - 14:07:15]
data in a dayon Json file here again I'm

[14:07:13 - 14:07:16]
not an expert in next but I've seen a

[14:07:15 - 14:07:18]
little bit of it so I'm I'm quite

[14:07:16 - 14:07:20]
comfortable with it so it's loading the

[14:07:18 - 14:07:23]
profile information here but if we were

[14:07:20 - 14:07:24]
to post information it would stringify

[14:07:23 - 14:07:26]
the information it actually would write

[14:07:24 - 14:07:29]
to the file so actually this would

[14:07:26 - 14:07:30]
persist well at least here it might I'm

[14:07:29 - 14:07:31]
not sure because I'm not sure if you can

[14:07:30 - 14:07:35]
write to files here but let's go ahead

[14:07:31 - 14:07:35]
and just say um exam

[14:07:35 - 14:07:43]
htps www.

[14:07:38 - 14:07:46]
exam. um and it is there so yeah I guess

[14:07:43 - 14:07:49]
that technically does does work

[14:07:46 - 14:07:52]
um now yeah this is good enough actually

[14:07:49 - 14:07:53]
to be honest um so now that we have this

[14:07:52 - 14:07:55]
I probably what I'd like to do is get

[14:07:53 - 14:07:58]
this in a into a GitHub repo so let me

[14:07:55 - 14:08:00]
see if I can sync this so we go up to

[14:07:58 - 14:08:03]
here we can add it to a code

[14:08:00 - 14:08:04]
base run this command to add this block

[14:08:03 - 14:08:07]
to your code

[14:08:04 - 14:08:08]
base uh that's not exactly what I want

[14:08:07 - 14:08:11]
to do but let's go over to here and take

[14:08:08 - 14:08:13]
a look oh wow so maybe what it's saying

[14:08:11 - 14:08:15]
is like I could literally use this one

[14:08:13 - 14:08:17]
liner to add this entire page this

[14:08:15 - 14:08:19]
entire block to my website that's

[14:08:17 - 14:08:23]
actually kind of interesting but what I

[14:08:19 - 14:08:23]
I wanted to know was like is there a

[14:08:24 - 14:08:28]
repo I didn't mean to Fork it that's

[14:08:26 - 14:08:32]
totally

[14:08:28 - 14:08:33]
fine all right so what I'm going to do I

[14:08:32 - 14:08:34]
mean I really do want to deploy so I

[14:08:33 - 14:08:36]
already have a versell account if you

[14:08:34 - 14:08:37]
don't just go create a versell account

[14:08:36 - 14:08:39]
they're free I'm on the free tier right

[14:08:37 - 14:08:41]
now we're going to add this to versel

[14:08:39 - 14:08:44]
we'll create a new project it'll just

[14:08:41 - 14:08:48]
call this uh versel link

[14:08:44 - 14:08:50]
tree okay we'll go ahead and create that

[14:08:48 - 14:08:52]
you would have to make a versell account

[14:08:50 - 14:08:53]
separately from this I'm going to go

[14:08:52 - 14:08:55]
over to

[14:08:53 - 14:08:58]
versel and we'll take a

[14:08:55 - 14:08:59]
look and uh for those who don't know the

[14:08:58 - 14:09:01]
Gen boot camp is actually running on

[14:08:59 - 14:09:03]
versell I just found it really easy to

[14:09:01 - 14:09:05]
do that um so right now this is not

[14:09:03 - 14:09:07]
connected to repo so I suppose this

[14:09:05 - 14:09:12]
would be the way that you would do

[14:09:07 - 14:09:12]
it but is this deploying let's go take a

[14:09:13 - 14:09:18]
look I mean it's

[14:09:16 - 14:09:21]
here

[14:09:18 - 14:09:23]
but yeah I would not call that sync we

[14:09:21 - 14:09:26]
also have a console which is kind of

[14:09:23 - 14:09:29]
interesting but how do

[14:09:26 - 14:09:33]
I how do I put this in my

[14:09:29 - 14:09:39]
repo oh it's over here maybe no no no no

[14:09:33 - 14:09:39]
okay so v0 push to

[14:09:39 - 14:09:46]
GitHub can we do

[14:09:42 - 14:09:49]
that install fresh copy in the new

[14:09:46 - 14:09:50]
project okay so basically the way we'd

[14:09:49 - 14:09:51]
have to add it is literally the way

[14:09:50 - 14:09:53]
they're describing which is add that

[14:09:51 - 14:09:55]
Shad CN thing so I'm going to go try

[14:09:53 - 14:09:57]
that really quickly I'm going to make a

[14:09:55 - 14:09:59]
new repo here I can make it public it

[14:09:57 - 14:10:02]
doesn't matter I'll put it under Omen

[14:09:59 - 14:10:04]
King here today this will be uh versel

[14:10:02 - 14:10:07]
or v0 link

[14:10:04 - 14:10:10]
tree example and I'll leave this as

[14:10:07 - 14:10:13]
public for now I'm going to go ahead and

[14:10:10 - 14:10:15]
um create this

[14:10:13 - 14:10:17]
repo and I'm going to open this up in

[14:10:15 - 14:10:21]
GitHub I almost kind of regret not

[14:10:17 - 14:10:21]
adding the dot uh the dot uh

[14:10:22 - 14:10:26]
um whichever uh I was hoping it would

[14:10:25 - 14:10:29]
show me like the buttons here but it's

[14:10:26 - 14:10:31]
also over here as well I do want to open

[14:10:29 - 14:10:33]
up G pod so I'll I'll just click that

[14:10:31 - 14:10:36]
anyway if you don't you don't have that

[14:10:33 - 14:10:39]
button for git pod there's the git pod

[14:10:36 - 14:10:41]
um Chrome extension you can get git pod

[14:10:39 - 14:10:43]
has a free tier if you can't do that

[14:10:41 - 14:10:46]
you'll have to use GI GitHub code spaces

[14:10:43 - 14:10:47]
you have to figure it out um as we do

[14:10:46 - 14:10:48]
use a bunch of different types of

[14:10:47 - 14:10:50]
developer environments sometimes I do

[14:10:48 - 14:10:52]
things locally I sometimes just get PL

[14:10:50 - 14:10:53]
get go spaces I use a combination of

[14:10:52 - 14:10:56]
things to keep you on your

[14:10:53 - 14:10:57]
toes um but you should be fluid you

[14:10:56 - 14:10:58]
should be able to work in any kind of

[14:10:57 - 14:11:00]
environment because you never know what

[14:10:58 - 14:11:02]
you'll have to use tomorrow um but

[14:11:00 - 14:11:03]
anyway so we have the repo here it's

[14:11:02 - 14:11:05]
completely empty and so so it's saying

[14:11:03 - 14:11:07]
if we want to install this we'll bring

[14:11:05 - 14:11:10]
in this block so I'm going to go back

[14:11:07 - 14:11:12]
over to here very interesting way to add

[14:11:10 - 14:11:13]
it we'll go ahead and we'll run this

[14:11:12 - 14:11:15]
single

[14:11:13 - 14:11:16]
line I wonder that i' have to create the

[14:11:15 - 14:11:20]
project first let's go back over to here

[14:11:16 - 14:11:20]
it says install a fresh copy of

[14:11:21 - 14:11:25]
nextjs let me see

[14:11:28 - 14:11:33]
here yeah I can see having to do this

[14:11:38 - 14:11:42]
to your code base well let's just run

[14:11:40 - 14:11:45]
and see what happens without adding uh

[14:11:42 - 14:11:47]
nextjs first I like okay so install the

[14:11:45 - 14:11:50]
following packages yes we'll do

[14:11:47 - 14:11:53]
that I just wonder how it would work if

[14:11:50 - 14:11:56]
there was nothing I just don't

[14:11:53 - 14:11:58]
know so we'll just expand this a little

[14:11:56 - 14:12:00]
bit had a little bit of a weight there

[14:11:58 - 14:12:01]
but does not contain a package Json yes

[14:12:00 - 14:12:03]
let's get us all set up if you can

[14:12:01 - 14:12:05]
create all this stuff for me I'd be very

[14:12:03 - 14:12:07]
happy for

[14:12:05 - 14:12:09]
that um so yeah we'll just let it

[14:12:07 - 14:12:11]
configure a new nextjs project if you're

[14:12:09 - 14:12:13]
not familiar with nextjs it is a backend

[14:12:11 - 14:12:15]
framework written or created by versel

[14:12:13 - 14:12:18]
obviously very easy to deploy versel uh

[14:12:15 - 14:12:20]
it's Ruby or railes so um I feel like I

[14:12:18 - 14:12:22]
can make my way around it I think it

[14:12:20 - 14:12:25]
might use expressjs underneath I'm not

[14:12:22 - 14:12:26]
100% certain but we will let it create

[14:12:25 - 14:12:28]
and it says it'll take a few minutes so

[14:12:26 - 14:12:31]
I'll pause so we can speed through this

[14:12:28 - 14:12:32]
okay all right so we'll choose a style

[14:12:31 - 14:12:33]
we maybe with New York neutral I don't

[14:12:32 - 14:12:35]
really care

[14:12:33 - 14:12:36]
uh would you like to use CS variables

[14:12:35 - 14:12:41]
sure why

[14:12:36 - 14:12:41]
not and it will'll just continue on

[14:12:42 - 14:12:48]
here again I'll just pause if this takes

[14:12:44 - 14:12:49]
a long time oh now it's registering now

[14:12:48 - 14:12:51]
it's installing

[14:12:49 - 14:12:53]
dependencies yeah this is going to take

[14:12:51 - 14:12:54]
a little bit of time oh it just finished

[14:12:53 - 14:12:57]
okay great uh page already exists would

[14:12:54 - 14:13:00]
you like to overwrite it I don't know

[14:12:57 - 14:13:00]
would I like to override

[14:13:00 - 14:13:09]
it I'm trying to find where page is I

[14:13:03 - 14:13:09]
mean I don't even see it in here um

[14:13:11 - 14:13:16]
here read our

[14:13:14 - 14:13:18]
docs go to

[14:13:16 - 14:13:21]
nextjs I mean this looks like a very

[14:13:18 - 14:13:24]
generic page so I would probably say

[14:13:21 - 14:13:26]
yes okay and so now we have it

[14:13:24 - 14:13:28]
here

[14:13:26 - 14:13:30]
um and it's saying there's a newer major

[14:13:28 - 14:13:31]
version which is fine uh let's run this

[14:13:30 - 14:13:33]
locally see if we can get it working

[14:13:31 - 14:13:36]
normally you go to your package Json

[14:13:33 - 14:13:41]
this would be this is using next so we

[14:13:36 - 14:13:44]
do mpm run uh I guess in this case it's

[14:13:41 - 14:13:47]
start and it's saying

[14:13:44 - 14:13:49]
here canot find package.json are you

[14:13:47 - 14:13:51]
sure it's uh it's right there I have it

[14:13:49 - 14:13:54]
open right in front of

[14:13:51 - 14:13:57]
us but you know what it's we are in whoa

[14:13:54 - 14:13:59]
what's going on here there is uh oh it

[14:13:57 - 14:14:01]
made it inside of a folder it's a bit

[14:13:59 - 14:14:05]
silly so we'll go here and I'm just

[14:14:01 - 14:14:05]
going to say mpm

[14:14:05 - 14:14:10]
install

[14:14:07 - 14:14:12]
okay and I'll just do mpm Run

[14:14:10 - 14:14:14]
start says could not find a production

[14:14:12 - 14:14:16]
build in the next next directory try

[14:14:14 - 14:14:19]
building your app with next build before

[14:14:16 - 14:14:21]
doing that okay so mpm run build is the

[14:14:19 - 14:14:21]
first thing we'll

[14:14:24 - 14:14:28]
do I I spelled it wrong so if you spell

[14:14:27 - 14:14:31]
it wrong it won't

[14:14:28 - 14:14:32]
work so creating an optimized production

[14:14:31 - 14:14:34]
uh for the build I mean I just wanted to

[14:14:32 - 14:14:36]
start using it oh you know what it's

[14:14:34 - 14:14:38]
probably mpm

[14:14:36 - 14:14:39]
runev there we go okay so now it's

[14:14:38 - 14:14:40]
started on Local Host Port 3000 let's

[14:14:39 - 14:14:43]
open it

[14:14:40 - 14:14:45]
up um so we'll go to Ports here click

[14:14:43 - 14:14:47]
here let's see if we have a working

[14:14:45 - 14:14:49]
application we'll give it a moment to

[14:14:47 - 14:14:52]
you

[14:14:49 - 14:14:56]
think and it already has an error so

[14:14:52 - 14:14:58]
that's going to error out on us it says

[14:14:56 - 14:15:00]
import

[14:14:58 - 14:15:02]
profile cannot resolve components

[14:15:00 - 14:15:04]
profile okay fair enough we'll go into

[14:15:02 - 14:15:06]
our directory here and we do have a

[14:15:04 - 14:15:10]
profile here so I'm not sure why I can't

[14:15:06 - 14:15:13]
resolve it um it's probably loading in

[14:15:10 - 14:15:16]
the page.

[14:15:13 - 14:15:20]
txt um where is

[14:15:16 - 14:15:22]
this page. txt yeah okay and this is in

[14:15:20 - 14:15:24]
here so it's interesting the components

[14:15:22 - 14:15:27]
are on the outside of the

[14:15:24 - 14:15:29]
app I'm not sure if that's intentional

[14:15:27 - 14:15:29]
or

[14:15:29 - 14:15:33]
[Music]

[14:15:30 - 14:15:35]
not h

[14:15:33 - 14:15:36]
interesting but it's clearly two

[14:15:35 - 14:15:38]
different levels uh normally like you

[14:15:36 - 14:15:40]
might I wonder if we can do an ET sign

[14:15:38 - 14:15:43]
here let's see if that fixes our

[14:15:40 - 14:15:45]
problem sometimes uh at time will like

[14:15:43 - 14:15:46]
if it's configured in typescript this

[14:15:45 - 14:15:50]
would have to be configured somewhere

[14:15:46 - 14:15:51]
for um like see here if this is

[14:15:50 - 14:15:52]
configured then it would it would

[14:15:51 - 14:15:54]
default to the root and then that would

[14:15:52 - 14:15:56]
be less of an issue so maybe the code

[14:15:54 - 14:15:59]
generated just uh wasn't contextually

[14:15:56 - 14:16:01]
wear of where it was loading so that we

[14:15:59 - 14:16:03]
might still have some other issues but

[14:16:01 - 14:16:05]
for now that should be fine

[14:16:03 - 14:16:06]
right those ones are using at signs

[14:16:05 - 14:16:08]
we'll go back over to here and so now

[14:16:06 - 14:16:12]
our app is here I'm going to say exam

[14:16:08 - 14:16:16]
Pro exam Pro

[14:16:12 - 14:16:18]
htps www. exam pro. and we'll hit add so

[14:16:16 - 14:16:22]
now that's been added right so that is

[14:16:18 - 14:16:24]
there um so that's good but the question

[14:16:22 - 14:16:25]
is can we get this deployed right so we

[14:16:24 - 14:16:27]
do have it working now here in this

[14:16:25 - 14:16:30]
state and we have a

[14:16:27 - 14:16:31]
repo uh we don't have many files that's

[14:16:30 - 14:16:33]
good so the node modules must be being

[14:16:31 - 14:16:36]
ignored I'll just but the only thing is

[14:16:33 - 14:16:38]
that this is not top level right so I'm

[14:16:36 - 14:16:39]
kind of concerned that if I don't move

[14:16:38 - 14:16:40]
this into the top level it's not going

[14:16:39 - 14:16:42]
to work so I'm going to have to grab the

[14:16:40 - 14:16:46]
contents of all this and we need to move

[14:16:42 - 14:16:49]
it up a level see if we can do

[14:16:46 - 14:16:53]
that mhm that's not exactly working but

[14:16:49 - 14:16:59]
uh we'll say move the contents of a

[14:16:53 - 14:17:03]
folder up one level okay Linux and we'll

[14:16:59 - 14:17:03]
go get a command for that

[14:17:05 - 14:17:09]
yeah okay so that's pretty simple think

[14:17:07 - 14:17:12]
I'd know that off the top of my head but

[14:17:09 - 14:17:15]
nope so say move and it was like my full

[14:17:12 - 14:17:15]
my app to

[14:17:17 - 14:17:22]
this oh hold on let's go back here maybe

[14:17:19 - 14:17:26]
because it has a hold on

[14:17:22 - 14:17:26]
here let's try this

[14:17:29 - 14:17:33]
again okay another thing we could do is

[14:17:32 - 14:17:36]
we go into here and then I'll do period

[14:17:33 - 14:17:39]
and then I'll go dot dot for slash okay

[14:17:36 - 14:17:40]
so maybe that would move the contents

[14:17:39 - 14:17:42]
that is not working as I I hoped it

[14:17:40 - 14:17:45]
would oh wild card that's what I'm

[14:17:42 - 14:17:49]
missing here so let's go back up a level

[14:17:45 - 14:17:51]
here and so here we would do

[14:17:49 - 14:17:56]
um

[14:17:51 - 14:17:59]
move my app Aster and then

[14:17:56 - 14:18:01]
period okay there we go so now we should

[14:17:59 - 14:18:03]
have nothing in here it didn't move the

[14:18:01 - 14:18:05]
next directory though which is kind of

[14:18:03 - 14:18:07]
frustrating but maybe I can drag that

[14:18:05 - 14:18:08]
one up no it's not really dragging but

[14:18:07 - 14:18:11]
we'll just move that individual one

[14:18:08 - 14:18:12]
there so we'll just say next because I

[14:18:11 - 14:18:13]
want to move everything up I'm not sure

[14:18:12 - 14:18:15]
what I need to move so I'll just move

[14:18:13 - 14:18:17]
everything out of there we still have a

[14:18:15 - 14:18:18]
few other files that are there I'll just

[14:18:17 - 14:18:21]
drag them there it might be easy to do

[14:18:18 - 14:18:25]
that yes I do want to move them and now

[14:18:21 - 14:18:27]
I'll get rid of this

[14:18:25 - 14:18:29]
directory okay it doesn't know about the

[14:18:27 - 14:18:30]
G uh the dot g ignorer sometimes that

[14:18:29 - 14:18:34]
happens so

[14:18:30 - 14:18:36]
just I would make sure

[14:18:34 - 14:18:37]
it's always the annoying the annoying

[14:18:36 - 14:18:38]
part here but I'll just do get status

[14:18:37 - 14:18:41]
here because it could be a little bit

[14:18:38 - 14:18:44]
hard to do it here in the left hand side

[14:18:41 - 14:18:44]
I just want to unstage all of our

[14:18:46 - 14:18:49]
[Music]

[14:18:50 - 14:18:53]
changes you know what it's been so long

[14:18:52 - 14:18:57]
that I don't even remember how to do

[14:18:53 - 14:18:59]
that anymore un how to unstage changes

[14:18:57 - 14:19:01]
get wow I actually can't believe I can't

[14:18:59 - 14:19:04]
remember that that's

[14:19:01 - 14:19:05]
crazy I think get reset actually I

[14:19:04 - 14:19:07]
didn't find it but I'm just going to try

[14:19:05 - 14:19:10]
get

[14:19:07 - 14:19:10]
reset uh get

[14:19:10 - 14:19:16]
status okay perfect excellent so now we

[14:19:13 - 14:19:17]
have the files here like this and if we

[14:19:16 - 14:19:21]
add them all back here we'll have less

[14:19:17 - 14:19:24]
of an issue okay so just say uh commit

[14:19:21 - 14:19:26]
project and so I'll commit that so now

[14:19:24 - 14:19:27]
that we have this project and we know

[14:19:26 - 14:19:29]
that it's working because even if we

[14:19:27 - 14:19:30]
deployed it and it didn't work we'd

[14:19:29 - 14:19:32]
still have some trouble we'll go back

[14:19:30 - 14:19:35]
over here to versel and it's created the

[14:19:32 - 14:19:38]
project but we have to link the repo so

[14:19:35 - 14:19:39]
go to GitHub here and you have to use a

[14:19:38 - 14:19:40]
personal account absolutely have to use

[14:19:39 - 14:19:43]
a personal account or won't let you link

[14:19:40 - 14:19:45]
it up so we have vzero link tree example

[14:19:43 - 14:19:47]
go to connect that this again this is

[14:19:45 - 14:19:49]
all free tier so this will not be much

[14:19:47 - 14:19:52]
of an issue at least I think it's free

[14:19:49 - 14:19:54]
tier um and so now it's connected let's

[14:19:52 - 14:19:56]
go over to the

[14:19:54 - 14:20:02]
projects and we don't have any

[14:19:56 - 14:20:03]
deployments here um which is fine let's

[14:20:02 - 14:20:05]
go to deployment ments I wonder if we

[14:20:03 - 14:20:07]
can deploy it from the interface

[14:20:05 - 14:20:10]
here maybe

[14:20:07 - 14:20:11]
not um but we have a repo for it so

[14:20:10 - 14:20:13]
we've connected the

[14:20:11 - 14:20:15]
repo I'm kind of doing this in a kind of

[14:20:13 - 14:20:17]
a weird order but the idea is like we

[14:20:15 - 14:20:21]
need to configure an existing repo for

[14:20:17 - 14:20:23]
versel so let's say like I have a GI I

[14:20:21 - 14:20:28]
have a

[14:20:23 - 14:20:30]
project uh that I need to add to

[14:20:28 - 14:20:33]
versell maybe we'll just install versell

[14:20:30 - 14:20:35]
we just say mpm install versell

[14:20:33 - 14:20:38]
hyphen G I'm just guessing here I've

[14:20:35 - 14:20:40]
done it before it's been a

[14:20:38 - 14:20:41]
while like worst case I'll just delete

[14:20:40 - 14:20:43]
that other project and we'll deploy it

[14:20:41 - 14:20:45]
again so maybe what we'll

[14:20:43 - 14:20:47]
do I know this is a little bit messy but

[14:20:45 - 14:20:50]
we'll go back over to

[14:20:47 - 14:20:51]
versel wherever it is I'm not sure why I

[14:20:50 - 14:20:54]
can't find it

[14:20:51 - 14:20:56]
here click back here we go and I'm just

[14:20:54 - 14:20:58]
going to delete this um this project

[14:20:56 - 14:21:01]
here this one

[14:20:58 - 14:21:02]
here uh we'll go to settings here

[14:21:01 - 14:21:04]
because it's probably easier just to

[14:21:02 - 14:21:08]
push a new project from

[14:21:04 - 14:21:08]
scratch then the way that we're doing it

[14:21:10 - 14:21:16]
here

[14:21:13 - 14:21:18]
okay and we'll hit continue and so we'll

[14:21:16 - 14:21:19]
go back over to here and this is trying

[14:21:18 - 14:21:21]
to install the global one I'm not sure

[14:21:19 - 14:21:23]
why it's hanging but maybe it needs some

[14:21:21 - 14:21:25]
time so I'm just going to wait a little

[14:21:23 - 14:21:27]
bit here okay all right that took some

[14:21:25 - 14:21:30]
time to install but it is now installed

[14:21:27 - 14:21:31]
so that that is now in good shape here

[14:21:30 - 14:21:33]
um so I'm just going to I think it's

[14:21:31 - 14:21:35]
just versel

[14:21:33 - 14:21:38]
and that will set up a new project so

[14:21:35 - 14:21:40]
continue with GitHub so log into versell

[14:21:38 - 14:21:43]
yeah let's do that we'll go ahead and

[14:21:40 - 14:21:44]
just say GitHub here um that might be

[14:21:43 - 14:21:46]
hard because I'm in a cloud developer

[14:21:44 - 14:21:49]
environment so I'm just trying to think

[14:21:46 - 14:21:52]
of like how can I do this can I even do

[14:21:49 - 14:21:52]
this in in in git

[14:21:57 - 14:22:04]
[Music]

[14:21:58 - 14:22:07]
pod versel login in in Cloud developer

[14:22:04 - 14:22:07]
environment how would I do

[14:22:07 - 14:22:13]
that sometimes they'll have like a flag

[14:22:10 - 14:22:13]
like like no browser or

[14:22:17 - 14:22:21]
whatever so this might not be something

[14:22:19 - 14:22:22]
that I can log into here so what I'm

[14:22:21 - 14:22:23]
going to have to do is I'm actually

[14:22:22 - 14:22:24]
going to have to use my local developer

[14:22:23 - 14:22:26]
environment this is where I'm kind of

[14:22:24 - 14:22:28]
running into an issue so I'm getting

[14:22:26 - 14:22:31]
back to this repository here I'm going

[14:22:28 - 14:22:32]
to shut down this git pod and I need to

[14:22:31 - 14:22:34]
clone this repo now so I'll give this

[14:22:32 - 14:22:37]
nice hard

[14:22:34 - 14:22:39]
refresh oh did we not push our

[14:22:37 - 14:22:42]
code no no no no we pushed code for this

[14:22:39 - 14:22:42]
didn't we

[14:22:42 - 14:22:50]
not okay so I'm gonna go back over to

[14:22:47 - 14:22:53]
giod IO thankfully the commits are still

[14:22:50 - 14:22:58]
here so it's not that big of a

[14:22:53 - 14:22:58]
deal but I guess I didn't push to the

[14:22:58 - 14:23:04]
repo so I'll just re reopen that up

[14:23:00 - 14:23:04]
again no biggie

[14:23:06 - 14:23:09]
let's give that a moment to

[14:23:11 - 14:23:17]
restart okay and so I mean I I could

[14:23:14 - 14:23:17]
have swore we pushed this get

[14:23:18 - 14:23:22]
push there we go so let's go back over

[14:23:20 - 14:23:24]
to here give us a hard refresh and so

[14:23:22 - 14:23:26]
now it is here so we are in good shape

[14:23:24 - 14:23:28]
I'm going to go ahead and stop this

[14:23:26 - 14:23:31]
workspace oh you know what I could have

[14:23:28 - 14:23:32]
done I could have just opened it locally

[14:23:31 - 14:23:34]
like G pod has an option to like a local

[14:23:32 - 14:23:36]
vs code I could have just done that but

[14:23:34 - 14:23:37]
that's okay I'm just going to clone it

[14:23:36 - 14:23:39]
anyway it's not a big deal so we get a

[14:23:37 - 14:23:43]
code here and we'll copy this I'm going

[14:23:39 - 14:23:47]
to make my way over to um anywhere here

[14:23:43 - 14:23:48]
so I just need to clone this repo here

[14:23:47 - 14:23:50]
so I probably have a tab uh we'll just

[14:23:48 - 14:23:53]
CD back in here I always like cloning

[14:23:50 - 14:23:55]
things into a site directory that I have

[14:23:53 - 14:23:57]
and then I'm going to CD into this

[14:23:55 - 14:24:00]
directory and I'm just going to open

[14:23:57 - 14:24:04]
this up in vs

[14:24:00 - 14:24:04]
code okay

[14:24:04 - 14:24:07]
and so make this a bit

[14:24:08 - 14:24:14]
larger um okay so now that I have this

[14:24:11 - 14:24:16]
open here what I want to do is I want to

[14:24:14 - 14:24:18]
open up my

[14:24:16 - 14:24:22]
terminal and I'm going to just get this

[14:24:18 - 14:24:22]
installed so let say mpm

[14:24:23 - 14:24:28]
install okay we'll give that a moment

[14:24:26 - 14:24:30]
once we do mpm install then we'll do mpm

[14:24:28 - 14:24:33]
install versus ly G but we'll do this

[14:24:30 - 14:24:34]
first okay all right so after a little

[14:24:33 - 14:24:36]
wait there it was installed we'll go

[14:24:34 - 14:24:38]
ahead and just make sure I install uh

[14:24:36 - 14:24:40]
versell if it's not installed on this

[14:24:38 - 14:24:41]
computer already this also did take a

[14:24:40 - 14:24:43]
little bit of time so we will wait for

[14:24:41 - 14:24:44]
that to install as well all right now

[14:24:43 - 14:24:46]
that that's installed we'll go ahead and

[14:24:44 - 14:24:48]
just type inv versel and it will want to

[14:24:46 - 14:24:50]
authenticate this time this time will

[14:24:48 - 14:24:51]
actually be able to open a link and we

[14:24:50 - 14:24:54]
will authenticate with GitHub as I

[14:24:51 - 14:24:56]
believe that's the way I use um versell

[14:24:54 - 14:24:57]
is through GitHub so it says that is

[14:24:56 - 14:25:02]
authenticated we're going to make our

[14:24:57 - 14:25:05]
way back over to um uh vs code wherever

[14:25:02 - 14:25:07]
that is and we'll say yes go ahead and

[14:25:05 - 14:25:10]
set that up we'll select those projects

[14:25:07 - 14:25:13]
we will not link it to existing project

[14:25:10 - 14:25:15]
we'll let it use that name it lives in

[14:25:13 - 14:25:17]
this directory so I guess we could have

[14:25:15 - 14:25:18]
kept in the my app directory if it was

[14:25:17 - 14:25:21]
an issue but it's

[14:25:18 - 14:25:22]
not um yes we will work with those

[14:25:21 - 14:25:24]
settings I assume that it knows what

[14:25:22 - 14:25:29]
it's doing so we'll let it do

[14:25:24 - 14:25:34]
that um which setting would you like to

[14:25:29 - 14:25:34]
overwrite I don't know uh enter here

[14:25:38 - 14:25:43]
okay and again because this is for sale

[14:25:41 - 14:25:46]
and it's nextjs I just hope that it just

[14:25:43 - 14:25:47]
easily works the first time but we did

[14:25:46 - 14:25:51]
correct our issues uh when we were in G

[14:25:47 - 14:25:53]
pod so it should be good now this will

[14:25:51 - 14:25:55]
probably deploy this to I mean it says

[14:25:53 - 14:25:55]
it gives us a production link but I'm

[14:25:55 - 14:25:57]
not sure if it's actually going to

[14:25:55 - 14:25:59]
deploy initially to production but I'm

[14:25:57 - 14:26:00]
going to pause here and just wait for

[14:25:59 - 14:26:03]
this very long building process to

[14:26:00 - 14:26:06]
finish okay all right so this is is

[14:26:03 - 14:26:08]
finished um we do have a production link

[14:26:06 - 14:26:11]
so let's go ahead and take take a look

[14:26:08 - 14:26:14]
here so I'll grab this one here if it

[14:26:11 - 14:26:15]
does Works that'd be great uh we have a

[14:26:14 - 14:26:18]
404 which is totally fine let's go over

[14:26:15 - 14:26:20]
to versel we'll go back to uh the versel

[14:26:18 - 14:26:23]
logo um I'm going to give this a nice

[14:26:20 - 14:26:25]
hard refresh here and we have the link

[14:26:23 - 14:26:27]
tree example here question is is it

[14:26:25 - 14:26:30]
deployed in production I'm not sure I

[14:26:27 - 14:26:34]
don't think so there is a commit

[14:26:30 - 14:26:34]
issue um the fail it failed to

[14:26:36 - 14:26:40]
build errors defin but never used so

[14:26:39 - 14:26:42]
this is the thing with typescript if you

[14:26:40 - 14:26:43]
don't use something then it errors out

[14:26:42 - 14:26:47]
when something's not being used which is

[14:26:43 - 14:26:48]
kind of annoying um so we'll go back

[14:26:47 - 14:26:51]
over to here again not sure why the

[14:26:48 - 14:26:52]
build takes forever but we'll go and

[14:26:51 - 14:26:57]
check

[14:26:52 - 14:27:01]
out um whever that was where did it say

[14:26:57 - 14:27:03]
the error was this was in routes. TS so

[14:27:01 - 14:27:07]
go into to routes.

[14:27:03 - 14:27:07]
TS and it was saying error was never

[14:27:09 - 14:27:13]
used

[14:27:11 - 14:27:16]
okay so I'm just going to console log

[14:27:13 - 14:27:18]
out error so that it doesn't complain as

[14:27:16 - 14:27:19]
much and maybe this will now build

[14:27:18 - 14:27:22]
properly so sometimes what you'll want

[14:27:19 - 14:27:25]
to do is do mpm run build and just see

[14:27:22 - 14:27:29]
if there's any errors

[14:27:25 - 14:27:31]
here it's just this build takes freaking

[14:27:29 - 14:27:33]
forever but we'll give it a moment we'll

[14:27:31 - 14:27:35]
see what happens okay all right so the

[14:27:33 - 14:27:36]
build seems like it found no problems

[14:27:35 - 14:27:38]
otherwise it would it would say

[14:27:36 - 14:27:39]
something here and I think we can go

[14:27:38 - 14:27:40]
ahead and now just do our verell

[14:27:39 - 14:27:42]
technically I'd like to deploy this in

[14:27:40 - 14:27:45]
production but we'll just do the regular

[14:27:42 - 14:27:47]
versell command for now and so we did

[14:27:45 - 14:27:49]
just recently build so maybe it we'll

[14:27:47 - 14:27:51]
just take that build and push it and so

[14:27:49 - 14:27:52]
we will wait I know it's going to build

[14:27:51 - 14:27:54]
it again so we'll wait and see what

[14:27:52 - 14:27:56]
happens here all right after a little

[14:27:54 - 14:27:58]
wait we have no errors down here below

[14:27:56 - 14:28:00]
so it makes me think that this is

[14:27:58 - 14:28:03]
probably working correctly we'll go over

[14:28:00 - 14:28:06]
to here and and we'll give this a nice

[14:28:03 - 14:28:07]
hard refresh and we still get an error

[14:28:06 - 14:28:08]
I'm not sure if that's the the old one

[14:28:07 - 14:28:12]
or not so I'm going to click back over

[14:28:08 - 14:28:13]
to here and we'll go into link tree and

[14:28:12 - 14:28:16]
we'll go to

[14:28:13 - 14:28:19]
deployments and this one's ready so

[14:28:16 - 14:28:21]
again I didn't say deploy it to

[14:28:19 - 14:28:23]
production link uh usually you do a hi

[14:28:21 - 14:28:24]
hien prod but we don't have a URL hooked

[14:28:23 - 14:28:26]
up so maybe it doesn't make a difference

[14:28:24 - 14:28:28]
oh no this is actually in preview

[14:28:26 - 14:28:29]
because it was authenticating here so if

[14:28:28 - 14:28:31]
we wanted to deploy this for productions

[14:28:29 - 14:28:32]
for everybody to see we would just have

[14:28:31 - 14:28:34]
to change one

[14:28:32 - 14:28:35]
flag um but I'm going to go ahead and

[14:28:34 - 14:28:38]
just see if I can add this link and if

[14:28:35 - 14:28:38]
it will

[14:28:39 - 14:28:47]
persist okay oh I entered the

[14:28:43 - 14:28:49]
URL uh maybe this is not a

[14:28:47 - 14:28:51]
colon there we

[14:28:49 - 14:28:54]
go and we'll refresh there we are and so

[14:28:51 - 14:28:55]
I I built my own little link tree very

[14:28:54 - 14:28:57]
quickly deployed to versel now if we

[14:28:55 - 14:28:59]
wanted again to deploy this production

[14:28:57 - 14:29:01]
all we'd have to do is go ahead and do H

[14:28:59 - 14:29:03]
hen prod I'm not going to do that here

[14:29:01 - 14:29:04]
today I'm not really worried about it

[14:29:03 - 14:29:05]
but unless you do that it's going to go

[14:29:04 - 14:29:08]
to this link and this is actually a

[14:29:05 - 14:29:10]
preview link and people can't access

[14:29:08 - 14:29:12]
access that from anywhere you'd have to

[14:29:10 - 14:29:15]
do prod let's go ahead and delete the

[14:29:12 - 14:29:16]
verell project and now we're basically

[14:29:15 - 14:29:19]
well that was the deployment that wasn't

[14:29:16 - 14:29:20]
necessarily the project this is free

[14:29:19 - 14:29:21]
tiar so this project is not going to

[14:29:20 - 14:29:24]
hurt us if we keep it around but I'm

[14:29:21 - 14:29:26]
going to just go clean up because I want

[14:29:24 - 14:29:30]
to and we'll go

[14:29:26 - 14:29:34]
ahead copy this we'll copy

[14:29:30 - 14:29:36]
this we'll delete it there we go I will

[14:29:34 - 14:29:39]
see you in the next one okay

[14:29:36 - 14:29:41]
[Music]

[14:29:39 - 14:29:42]
ciao hey everyone this is angrew brown

[14:29:41 - 14:29:44]
and today we're going to be taking a

[14:29:42 - 14:29:46]
look at gradio so gradio is another

[14:29:44 - 14:29:48]
thing that can quickly uh do app

[14:29:46 - 14:29:50]
prototyping it's very popular among data

[14:29:48 - 14:29:52]
scientists and uh people in the data

[14:29:50 - 14:29:53]
space that know python really well but

[14:29:52 - 14:29:55]
don't know how to build front-end

[14:29:53 - 14:29:58]
applications because we can use minimal

[14:29:55 - 14:30:01]
code uh to build out interfaces also

[14:29:58 - 14:30:02]
think there's like ways of Hosting um

[14:30:01 - 14:30:04]
gradio like there's something like

[14:30:02 - 14:30:06]
called gradio spaces I believe I'm not

[14:30:04 - 14:30:08]
100% certain it's cool that they also

[14:30:06 - 14:30:10]
have a playground of stuff that we can

[14:30:08 - 14:30:11]
work with so this might be an example of

[14:30:10 - 14:30:13]
where we can actually start working with

[14:30:11 - 14:30:15]
gradio to learn it so I'm just going to

[14:30:13 - 14:30:16]
increase the size here and take a look

[14:30:15 - 14:30:19]
yeah see over here we have spaces I

[14:30:16 - 14:30:22]
think that's hugging space uh hugging

[14:30:19 - 14:30:24]
space spaces I'm not sure let me just

[14:30:22 - 14:30:26]
click this here yeah it's hugging space

[14:30:24 - 14:30:28]
so um that's somewhere where we can

[14:30:26 - 14:30:30]
deploy it I'm also just uh wondering if

[14:30:28 - 14:30:33]
there's like a spaces

[14:30:30 - 14:30:35]
CLI h

[14:30:33 - 14:30:40]
uh we'll say hugging

[14:30:35 - 14:30:40]
face because I've seen this um CI

[14:30:41 - 14:30:45]
before for spaces but yeah I'm not 100%

[14:30:43 - 14:30:46]
certain where it is but here on the

[14:30:45 - 14:30:48]
right hand side it is loading I'm not

[14:30:46 - 14:30:51]
sure why it's going so slow

[14:30:48 - 14:30:52]
here but here we have an interface for

[14:30:51 - 14:30:54]
it so this might be better to play

[14:30:52 - 14:30:56]
around with this locally as we don't

[14:30:54 - 14:30:58]
need any anything special to do that um

[14:30:56 - 14:31:02]
so I'm going to use my local developer

[14:30:58 - 14:31:04]
environment uh today so um I'm going to

[14:31:02 - 14:31:06]
pull in I got a lot of projects open

[14:31:04 - 14:31:08]
here so I'm just going to close out a

[14:31:06 - 14:31:10]
few of these here so I have a little bit

[14:31:08 - 14:31:12]
more focus

[14:31:10 - 14:31:15]
and I'll just close this one out here

[14:31:12 - 14:31:17]
and so we have this here but I'm going

[14:31:15 - 14:31:19]
to go down below I'm just going to make

[14:31:17 - 14:31:20]
a new repo um actually this is something

[14:31:19 - 14:31:22]
we could just probably do in git pod as

[14:31:20 - 14:31:25]
well um I think I'll do that in git pod

[14:31:22 - 14:31:27]
here today because we have

[14:31:25 - 14:31:30]
the uh jny Essentials repo and I'd

[14:31:27 - 14:31:32]
rather work in that one um I'm not

[14:31:30 - 14:31:33]
always committing all the code into the

[14:31:32 - 14:31:36]
repo but I would like to commit this one

[14:31:33 - 14:31:37]
geni Essentials repo and so I'm going to

[14:31:36 - 14:31:38]
go ahead and open this up in actually

[14:31:37 - 14:31:40]
you know what we'll do GitHub code

[14:31:38 - 14:31:41]
spaces this time I feel like I should

[14:31:40 - 14:31:43]
alternate so we'll go ahead and make a

[14:31:41 - 14:31:45]
new GitHub code spaces I don't like

[14:31:43 - 14:31:48]
GitHub codes spaces as much as I like G

[14:31:45 - 14:31:50]
git pod but again variation is useful

[14:31:48 - 14:31:52]
I'm going to go down below and change my

[14:31:50 - 14:31:54]
settings and I'm just using the free

[14:31:52 - 14:31:57]
tier here so this should not cost you

[14:31:54 - 14:32:02]
anything and go back down here to theme

[14:31:57 - 14:32:04]
and we'll turn this into a dark mode

[14:32:02 - 14:32:08]
okay now gradio is really good uh to be

[14:32:04 - 14:32:10]
generated out utilizing uh vs code um

[14:32:08 - 14:32:12]
I'm not going to do that right away here

[14:32:10 - 14:32:13]
because I feel that um we should just

[14:32:12 - 14:32:16]
learn the basics of

[14:32:13 - 14:32:18]
gradio and um I'm just going to install

[14:32:16 - 14:32:19]
one extension you don't have to install

[14:32:18 - 14:32:22]
this I'm installing it for me if you

[14:32:19 - 14:32:23]
don't know Vim do not install this but

[14:32:22 - 14:32:25]
it makes it my life easier moving things

[14:32:23 - 14:32:27]
around this will remap all your keys

[14:32:25 - 14:32:29]
just don't install this is for me I'm

[14:32:27 - 14:32:31]
not sure if there's a gradio plugin but

[14:32:29 - 14:32:34]
there is it'd be interesting to see that

[14:32:31 - 14:32:36]
we have gradio syntax highlighter

[14:32:34 - 14:32:38]
um no that's not really that useful to

[14:32:36 - 14:32:40]
me but we'll go back over to here and

[14:32:38 - 14:32:41]
let's start working with gradio so the

[14:32:40 - 14:32:43]
first thing is we're going to need to

[14:32:41 - 14:32:44]
install gradio so I'm going to make a

[14:32:43 - 14:32:47]
new file

[14:32:44 - 14:32:49]
here um yeah I'll make a new file we'll

[14:32:47 - 14:32:52]
call it

[14:32:49 - 14:32:54]
requirements.txt and I'm just going to

[14:32:52 - 14:32:54]
drop in

[14:32:55 - 14:32:59]
gradio I would expect that python would

[14:32:58 - 14:33:01]
already be pre-installed on here so I'm

[14:32:59 - 14:33:03]
just typ in Python hyen hyen version and

[14:33:01 - 14:33:04]
we have a decent version here so I'm

[14:33:03 - 14:33:07]
going to CD into that we're going to

[14:33:04 - 14:33:10]
type in PIP install hyphen R

[14:33:07 - 14:33:12]
requirements.txt and so that's going to

[14:33:10 - 14:33:13]
get us set up with gradio here and we

[14:33:12 - 14:33:15]
should start working through these

[14:33:13 - 14:33:17]
examples as they say it's really easy to

[14:33:15 - 14:33:19]
use um so I'm going to pull this off

[14:33:17 - 14:33:20]
screen and I'm just going to write it

[14:33:19 - 14:33:22]
out and you write it with me as we work

[14:33:20 - 14:33:25]
through this um but I think this might

[14:33:22 - 14:33:28]
be a better way to to learn gradio as we

[14:33:25 - 14:33:30]
go through it um again not a super

[14:33:28 - 14:33:31]
expert but I'm very good at coding so

[14:33:30 - 14:33:33]
this should be very easy so let's go

[14:33:31 - 14:33:37]
ahead and start with our hello world and

[14:33:33 - 14:33:38]
so I'm going to say hello world. pi and

[14:33:37 - 14:33:39]
so the first thing we're going to need

[14:33:38 - 14:33:41]
to

[14:33:39 - 14:33:43]
do and sure we'll install the python

[14:33:41 - 14:33:46]
extension why

[14:33:43 - 14:33:47]
not um we'll go back over to our

[14:33:46 - 14:33:49]
hello.py and so we're going to need to

[14:33:47 - 14:33:52]
import gradio that'll be the first thing

[14:33:49 - 14:33:53]
that we do okay and so the second thing

[14:33:52 - 14:33:56]
we'll want to

[14:33:53 - 14:33:58]
do is we'll need to create an interface

[14:33:56 - 14:33:59]
so let's go ahead and type in demo

[14:33:58 - 14:34:03]
equals

[14:33:59 - 14:34:03]
gr interface

[14:34:05 - 14:34:09]
um and you know I mean we have these

[14:34:08 - 14:34:10]
examples here but I would be kind of

[14:34:09 - 14:34:11]
interested in looking at the

[14:34:10 - 14:34:14]
documentation so let me see if I can

[14:34:11 - 14:34:14]
find the gradio

[14:34:15 - 14:34:19]
documentation okay we'll pull this up

[14:34:17 - 14:34:20]
here this might be a better way to learn

[14:34:19 - 14:34:22]
so it says build and share Machine

[14:34:20 - 14:34:24]
learning demos and web apps using the

[14:34:22 - 14:34:26]
core gradio python Library so we have

[14:34:24 - 14:34:28]
interface blocks chat chat interface

[14:34:26 - 14:34:31]
text box image audio data frame so let's

[14:34:28 - 14:34:33]
go take a first look at interface so

[14:34:31 - 14:34:35]
inter is gradio main highle class and

[14:34:33 - 14:34:38]
allows you to create web based goys

[14:34:35 - 14:34:40]
demos around a machine learning model um

[14:34:38 - 14:34:42]
the function is to create a guey the

[14:34:40 - 14:34:45]
desired input components desired output

[14:34:42 - 14:34:46]
components so we did this and so here we

[14:34:45 - 14:34:48]
have the interface so maybe we'll just

[14:34:46 - 14:34:51]
grab a bit of this

[14:34:48 - 14:34:54]
code okay which we were already kind of

[14:34:51 - 14:34:57]
doing here and so we have

[14:34:54 - 14:35:01]
here a

[14:34:57 - 14:35:03]
function an input and an output I don't

[14:35:01 - 14:35:06]
like like four spaces I like two spaces

[14:35:03 - 14:35:08]
and even the Creator python regrets not

[14:35:06 - 14:35:10]
making uh making enforcing that so we'll

[14:35:08 - 14:35:13]
just switch over to two spaces here but

[14:35:10 - 14:35:15]
let's try to understand what we have so

[14:35:13 - 14:35:16]
here we have the gradio interface and

[14:35:15 - 14:35:18]
these are the options we have we have a

[14:35:16 - 14:35:20]
function that can be called we have

[14:35:18 - 14:35:22]
possible inputs we have possible outputs

[14:35:20 - 14:35:25]
we have examples we have cache examples

[14:35:22 - 14:35:27]
cach mode and a bunch of other flags I

[14:35:25 - 14:35:30]
didn't realize how much was in here

[14:35:27 - 14:35:32]
that's a lot okay so if we go up to here

[14:35:30 - 14:35:34]
what do we have we have

[14:35:32 - 14:35:37]
our first interface and it's taking a

[14:35:34 - 14:35:39]
class called image classifier which

[14:35:37 - 14:35:42]
shows two things here it's literally a

[14:35:39 - 14:35:44]
function we have an inputs called image

[14:35:42 - 14:35:45]
and and an outputs called label all

[14:35:44 - 14:35:46]
right so let's go run that and see what

[14:35:45 - 14:35:50]
we get I feel like we wouldn't get a

[14:35:46 - 14:35:53]
whole lot but we'll type in python app.

[14:35:50 - 14:35:55]
or or hello world here we'll see if that

[14:35:53 - 14:35:58]
runs

[14:35:55 - 14:36:00]
it okay so that started up on Port

[14:35:58 - 14:36:03]
7860 we'll open this in the

[14:36:00 - 14:36:06]
browser we'll give it a moment here to

[14:36:03 - 14:36:08]
connect should not take too

[14:36:06 - 14:36:10]
long and so we have an interface what's

[14:36:08 - 14:36:12]
really interesting is we have the input

[14:36:10 - 14:36:14]
is an image so I guess when we said

[14:36:12 - 14:36:16]
inputs is an image then we get an image

[14:36:14 - 14:36:18]
right that's really interesting and the

[14:36:16 - 14:36:21]
outputs is a

[14:36:18 - 14:36:22]
label which is over here does this

[14:36:21 - 14:36:24]
actually already work and do something

[14:36:22 - 14:36:25]
that'd be really interesting if it does

[14:36:24 - 14:36:26]
so I'm going to see if I can find an

[14:36:25 - 14:36:29]
image to upload here really quickly so I

[14:36:26 - 14:36:32]
have a like a green screen photo of me

[14:36:29 - 14:36:34]
so I do this I say submit

[14:36:32 - 14:36:37]
oh wow we actually got something and I'm

[14:36:34 - 14:36:38]
a dog I'm not a cat but I'm a dog U

[14:36:37 - 14:36:40]
that's really interesting that that

[14:36:38 - 14:36:41]
actually does something I really didn't

[14:36:40 - 14:36:43]
expect that but you know what it looks

[14:36:41 - 14:36:44]
like this is a hard-coded value so it's

[14:36:43 - 14:36:46]
always going to be

[14:36:44 - 14:36:48]
0703

[14:36:46 - 14:36:51]
right okay so here I bet if I change

[14:36:48 - 14:36:52]
this to like 1.7 it almost looked like

[14:36:51 - 14:36:54]
that was a functional app but it's not

[14:36:52 - 14:36:56]
it's it's all it's complete nonsense

[14:36:54 - 14:36:59]
right but we go here and we feed it an

[14:36:56 - 14:37:02]
image which does absolutely nothing and

[14:36:59 - 14:37:03]
now notice the value is 7 % I thought I

[14:37:02 - 14:37:07]
changed it

[14:37:03 - 14:37:11]
right 1.7 maybe we have to stop it and

[14:37:07 - 14:37:13]
restart it for this to work

[14:37:11 - 14:37:15]
right okay because maybe that it didn't

[14:37:13 - 14:37:16]
pick up that data again this is all just

[14:37:15 - 14:37:21]
nonsense but we're going to go ahead and

[14:37:16 - 14:37:22]
submit it so now look it's 170% right so

[14:37:21 - 14:37:24]
that's really interesting another thing

[14:37:22 - 14:37:26]
that's interesting here is it says uh

[14:37:24 - 14:37:28]
running your url so you could share true

[14:37:26 - 14:37:29]
to launch it and then it'll be publicly

[14:37:28 - 14:37:32]
available I'm not sure if this would

[14:37:29 - 14:37:34]
actually work with this but we could try

[14:37:32 - 14:37:36]
that and see what happens if we do that

[14:37:34 - 14:37:39]
so we'll go ahead and stop it because

[14:37:36 - 14:37:41]
this is running in a a a a a git pod and

[14:37:39 - 14:37:42]
so it wouldn't necessarily have it but

[14:37:41 - 14:37:45]
notice that it now has this URL so

[14:37:42 - 14:37:46]
gradio is basically setting up a tunnel

[14:37:45 - 14:37:48]
so you can go over here and access it

[14:37:46 - 14:37:50]
somewhere else oh wow it does work so

[14:37:48 - 14:37:51]
there you go that is like a super easy

[14:37:50 - 14:37:53]
way that you could share this with

[14:37:51 - 14:37:55]
anybody and that's one of the powers of

[14:37:53 - 14:37:56]
gradio but so far this doesn't make a

[14:37:55 - 14:37:58]
whole lot of sense what we're doing so

[14:37:56 - 14:38:00]
let's go back to the docs and see if we

[14:37:58 - 14:38:02]
can learn a little bit more of what is

[14:38:00 - 14:38:04]
going on here because we have clearly

[14:38:02 - 14:38:07]
have different kinds of inputs and there

[14:38:04 - 14:38:09]
are different kinds of components so I

[14:38:07 - 14:38:11]
mean we put a string in called image but

[14:38:09 - 14:38:13]
how do we know what kind of inputs we

[14:38:11 - 14:38:14]
have that's what I want to know here so

[14:38:13 - 14:38:17]
I'm kind of looking at this and saying

[14:38:14 - 14:38:20]
okay um that's cool and all but how did

[14:38:17 - 14:38:20]
I know that that was my

[14:38:20 - 14:38:24]
inputs so here we have components here

[14:38:23 - 14:38:25]
on the left hand side so I wonder if

[14:38:24 - 14:38:28]
there's like an image component there

[14:38:25 - 14:38:29]
is okay and so that's so create an image

[14:38:28 - 14:38:32]
component that can be used to upload an

[14:38:29 - 14:38:34]
image and there's an example of it

[14:38:32 - 14:38:35]
so I wonder if we could have also put in

[14:38:34 - 14:38:37]
a gradio image and if that would have

[14:38:35 - 14:38:39]
done the same thing it looks like it

[14:38:37 - 14:38:41]
takes parentheses but let's go back over

[14:38:39 - 14:38:42]
to here for a second and instead of

[14:38:41 - 14:38:43]
having this as our inputs I'm going to

[14:38:42 - 14:38:45]
go up here and just Define a new

[14:38:43 - 14:38:47]
variable called inputs let's do this

[14:38:45 - 14:38:50]
instead and I think it's actually just

[14:38:47 - 14:38:53]
gr for gradio as we are using the

[14:38:50 - 14:38:54]
abbreviation and um obviously you can

[14:38:53 - 14:38:55]
take an array of it so I'm just going to

[14:38:54 - 14:38:58]
go ahead and change this to an array of

[14:38:55 - 14:39:01]
inputs and let's go switch this out and

[14:38:58 - 14:39:02]
see if this still works right that's

[14:39:01 - 14:39:04]
what I'm kind of expecting is this will

[14:39:02 - 14:39:06]
still work inputs again we're not

[14:39:04 - 14:39:07]
building anything useful right now we're

[14:39:06 - 14:39:09]
just kind of learning the components of

[14:39:07 - 14:39:11]
it to understand the level of

[14:39:09 - 14:39:13]
configuration that we can do and so if

[14:39:11 - 14:39:14]
we go back over to here it should still

[14:39:13 - 14:39:17]
be the same thing right we should not

[14:39:14 - 14:39:19]
get an error does it load it does

[14:39:17 - 14:39:21]
excellent okay so now we kind of have an

[14:39:19 - 14:39:23]
idea that we can load them in we could

[14:39:21 - 14:39:26]
obviously have done image what if we do

[14:39:23 - 14:39:27]
two here what happens now if we do two

[14:39:26 - 14:39:28]
so we're going to go hit down I don't

[14:39:27 - 14:39:30]
need the the shared link here so I'm

[14:39:28 - 14:39:31]
just going to say false because that's a

[14:39:30 - 14:39:35]
bit taxing on it and so I'm going to go

[14:39:31 - 14:39:38]
ahead and hit up

[14:39:35 - 14:39:39]
okay and so now this is running we'll go

[14:39:38 - 14:39:41]
back over to here we'll get a refresh

[14:39:39 - 14:39:44]
and so I'm expecting maybe two images in

[14:39:41 - 14:39:46]
here so now we have two images right um

[14:39:44 - 14:39:49]
of course it doesn't understand its

[14:39:46 - 14:39:51]
input I think here uh the input's coming

[14:39:49 - 14:39:53]
from whatever this image is so if there

[14:39:51 - 14:39:55]
was some kind of information about the

[14:39:53 - 14:39:57]
image that could be interesting so maybe

[14:39:55 - 14:39:59]
we could do is just say print and give

[14:39:57 - 14:40:00]
me information about the input that is

[14:39:59 - 14:40:01]
being passed along I believe this is

[14:40:00 - 14:40:03]
short for input

[14:40:01 - 14:40:04]
so I'm going to stop this again as I

[14:40:03 - 14:40:06]
don't believe this hot reloads there

[14:40:04 - 14:40:07]
might be an option to set tell it to hot

[14:40:06 - 14:40:09]
reload whenever we change the code I

[14:40:07 - 14:40:10]
don't know we'll give this a hard

[14:40:09 - 14:40:12]
refresh I'm going to go ahead and drag

[14:40:10 - 14:40:16]
this on over I'm going to hit submit

[14:40:12 - 14:40:18]
oops we'll hit submit

[14:40:16 - 14:40:19]
again uh and maybe it wants both the

[14:40:18 - 14:40:22]
images I'm not sure let's try this again

[14:40:19 - 14:40:23]
here submit and we have an error that's

[14:40:22 - 14:40:25]
totally fine let's go back over here and

[14:40:23 - 14:40:27]
take a

[14:40:25 - 14:40:29]
look and it could be that we don't have

[14:40:27 - 14:40:33]
the right amount of

[14:40:29 - 14:40:33]
parameters okay

[14:40:34 - 14:40:37]
so I'm guessing again I'm just guessing

[14:40:36 - 14:40:38]
without really reading about this but

[14:40:37 - 14:40:40]
I'm assuming that maybe we have input

[14:40:38 - 14:40:43]
one and input

[14:40:40 - 14:40:45]
two because we have two inputs so I

[14:40:43 - 14:40:47]
would think this would take two right uh

[14:40:45 - 14:40:50]
before we do that we'll have to just do

[14:40:47 - 14:40:53]
uh uh like that there and let's see if

[14:40:50 - 14:40:53]
that actually works

[14:40:54 - 14:40:58]
okay we'll give this a hard refresh

[14:40:56 - 14:41:00]
again right now we're building

[14:40:58 - 14:41:02]
nonsense but we will get to something

[14:41:00 - 14:41:04]
here in just a moment okay so we'll drag

[14:41:02 - 14:41:07]
in this image here and then and then uh

[14:41:04 - 14:41:09]
the image down below here that looks

[14:41:07 - 14:41:11]
good we'll go ahead and hit submit no

[14:41:09 - 14:41:14]
problems now so my hunch was correct and

[14:41:11 - 14:41:16]
we get back uh matrices of information

[14:41:14 - 14:41:18]
so probably that there's a

[14:41:16 - 14:41:20]
representation of what that data is we

[14:41:18 - 14:41:22]
would probably have to look at the

[14:41:20 - 14:41:23]
components itself to understand it so if

[14:41:22 - 14:41:26]
we go back over to the documentation we

[14:41:23 - 14:41:29]
have the image here okay an input

[14:41:26 - 14:41:31]
component pass the upload image as a

[14:41:29 - 14:41:34]
numpy array that's actually what it

[14:41:31 - 14:41:38]
looked like pl. image or string file

[14:41:34 - 14:41:40]
path depending on your type okay so for

[14:41:38 - 14:41:42]
the SVG type parameter is ignored so

[14:41:40 - 14:41:45]
maybe there's like a way to say like I

[14:41:42 - 14:41:47]
want this to be returned do we do have

[14:41:45 - 14:41:48]
initializations here so here we have

[14:41:47 - 14:41:50]
value and I think it's defaulting to an

[14:41:48 - 14:41:53]
array but maybe we'd rather have it as

[14:41:50 - 14:41:55]
this right so I wonder if what I could

[14:41:53 - 14:41:58]
do is go back over to

[14:41:55 - 14:41:59]
here okay and I could say value it

[14:41:58 - 14:42:03]
probably be

[14:41:59 - 14:42:03]
equals and

[14:42:04 - 14:42:07]
appeal image numy or path of your all

[14:42:06 - 14:42:09]
the default oh that's for the default

[14:42:07 - 14:42:11]
image that's not necessarily what gets

[14:42:09 - 14:42:13]
outputed so I was hoping that we could

[14:42:11 - 14:42:13]
control its

[14:42:15 - 14:42:19]
outputs but maybe we don't have control

[14:42:17 - 14:42:21]
over

[14:42:19 - 14:42:23]
that yeah yeah yeah so here it

[14:42:21 - 14:42:25]
represents it as a numpy aray so I think

[14:42:23 - 14:42:27]
maybe we don't have control maybe it

[14:42:25 - 14:42:31]
always

[14:42:27 - 14:42:31]
outputs output

[14:42:31 - 14:42:35]
as an uh as an output so an output

[14:42:35 - 14:42:40]
component okay but how do we know what

[14:42:37 - 14:42:42]
it is your function should return one of

[14:42:40 - 14:42:42]
these

[14:42:44 - 14:42:47]
types

[14:42:50 - 14:42:56]
mm okay here we go so no that's not

[14:42:53 - 14:42:57]
exactly what I wanted but uh like this

[14:42:56 - 14:42:59]
would take an input and then the output

[14:42:57 - 14:43:01]
is an output right like if we wanted to

[14:42:59 - 14:43:06]
change this to our output we went back

[14:43:01 - 14:43:06]
over to here we' say like outputs

[14:43:09 - 14:43:14]
here well that actually depends on

[14:43:11 - 14:43:15]
what's coming back here because if we

[14:43:14 - 14:43:17]
have this data this is get to pass into

[14:43:15 - 14:43:19]
here so we'd have to pass the image

[14:43:17 - 14:43:20]
along for it to work so that's probably

[14:43:19 - 14:43:22]
not a good idea so again I was just

[14:43:20 - 14:43:24]
trying to hope that we could change it

[14:43:22 - 14:43:25]
so that it's of a numpy array but it's

[14:43:24 - 14:43:28]
totally fine if it's a numpy array I

[14:43:25 - 14:43:29]
don't mind that and so that's a you know

[14:43:28 - 14:43:31]
starting to understand how these

[14:43:29 - 14:43:33]
components work right so that's pretty

[14:43:31 - 14:43:36]
clear let's go take a look at blocks

[14:43:33 - 14:43:38]
what's that so blocks is gradio lowlevel

[14:43:36 - 14:43:40]
API that allows you to create more

[14:43:38 - 14:43:42]
custom web application so I'm going to

[14:43:40 - 14:43:45]
go back over to here and we'll just name

[14:43:42 - 14:43:46]
rename this to

[14:43:45 - 14:43:49]
interface okay because that's really

[14:43:46 - 14:43:50]
what we're doing here um I guess the

[14:43:49 - 14:43:51]
other question is before we move on is

[14:43:50 - 14:43:54]
there another type of

[14:43:51 - 14:43:56]
interface interfaces is gradio Main High

[14:43:54 - 14:43:58]
Level class yeah yeah yeah okay let's go

[14:43:56 - 14:44:00]
take a look at blocks next so blocks is

[14:43:58 - 14:44:02]
gradio gradio lowlevel API that allows

[14:44:00 - 14:44:04]
you to create more cust web apps and

[14:44:02 - 14:44:05]
demos than interfaces okay compared to

[14:44:04 - 14:44:07]
interface class blocks as more

[14:44:05 - 14:44:10]
flexibility control over the layout of

[14:44:07 - 14:44:12]
components okay that makes sense so over

[14:44:10 - 14:44:14]
here we have an example let's go ahead

[14:44:12 - 14:44:16]
and grab

[14:44:14 - 14:44:20]
it okay we'll make a new folder here

[14:44:16 - 14:44:21]
called blocks. piy and we will oops

[14:44:20 - 14:44:24]
that's not what I

[14:44:21 - 14:44:28]
wanted we'll make a new file called

[14:44:24 - 14:44:30]
blocks. pi and we'll dump this in

[14:44:28 - 14:44:32]
here and so I'm going to stop this app

[14:44:30 - 14:44:33]
here and so now we're going to go ahead

[14:44:32 - 14:44:35]
and do

[14:44:33 - 14:44:38]
python uh block

[14:44:35 - 14:44:41]
high and that's going to start

[14:44:38 - 14:44:42]
up on whatever our default one is here

[14:44:41 - 14:44:44]
we'll give this a hard refresh should be

[14:44:42 - 14:44:47]
the same

[14:44:44 - 14:44:49]
port and what do we get so now we have

[14:44:47 - 14:44:51]
something here so let's take a look and

[14:44:49 - 14:44:55]
see what we have so we have a block

[14:44:51 - 14:44:58]
called demo so we have this area where

[14:44:55 - 14:44:59]
we have markdown that we're rendering

[14:44:58 - 14:45:01]
then we're just telling you to make a

[14:44:59 - 14:45:03]
row

[14:45:01 - 14:45:07]
okay in this row we want a text

[14:45:03 - 14:45:09]
field here okay we have a row of text

[14:45:07 - 14:45:12]
box text box we have two text boxes

[14:45:09 - 14:45:15]
input and output and then we have our

[14:45:12 - 14:45:18]
button here and then we have a button

[14:45:15 - 14:45:20]
click okay that kind of makes

[14:45:18 - 14:45:21]
sense so basically it sounds like it

[14:45:20 - 14:45:23]
just gives us a little bit more control

[14:45:21 - 14:45:24]
of our

[14:45:23 - 14:45:26]
layout

[14:45:24 - 14:45:31]
[Music]

[14:45:26 - 14:45:31]
MH oh seems like we can change our theme

[14:45:32 - 14:45:35]
okay I mean it already looks like the

[14:45:34 - 14:45:38]
theme is soft but let's go ahead and try

[14:45:35 - 14:45:41]
that so we'll just say theme

[14:45:38 - 14:45:44]
equals soft there's an example so I'm

[14:45:41 - 14:45:47]
going to stop this restart this let's

[14:45:44 - 14:45:47]
see if this changes its

[14:45:49 - 14:45:53]
look give it a moment here to

[14:45:51 - 14:45:54]
connect okay it kind of looks different

[14:45:53 - 14:45:57]
I'm actually kind of curious what other

[14:45:54 - 14:45:57]
kind of themes there

[14:45:57 - 14:46:01]
are let's go down here to themes maybe

[14:46:00 - 14:46:04]
they have the options over

[14:46:01 - 14:46:05]
here and obviously we can specify it

[14:46:04 - 14:46:08]
this way as

[14:46:05 - 14:46:11]
well is that what our theme looks like

[14:46:08 - 14:46:11]
there kind

[14:46:11 - 14:46:16]
of I'm just again I'm trying to see if

[14:46:13 - 14:46:16]
there's like a dark

[14:46:24 - 14:46:27]
[Music]

[14:46:27 - 14:46:34]
mode how do I get a dark mode theme

[14:46:31 - 14:46:37]
we'll say gradio dark theme

[14:46:34 - 14:46:37]
mode

[14:46:40 - 14:46:44]
blocks why don't we just try dark and

[14:46:42 - 14:46:44]
see what

[14:46:46 - 14:46:50]
happens okay because maybe that already

[14:46:48 - 14:46:51]
does exist and we'll just stop it again

[14:46:50 - 14:46:53]
this is how you learn you just play

[14:46:51 - 14:46:56]
around with things so you get results

[14:46:53 - 14:46:58]
and we'll go back over to

[14:46:56 - 14:47:01]
here and no it does not so I think that

[14:46:58 - 14:47:03]
maybe for that one we might have to to

[14:47:01 - 14:47:06]
override some of the theming to get it

[14:47:03 - 14:47:07]
but um that's fine but what I'm trying

[14:47:06 - 14:47:10]
to wonder like what I'm wondering about

[14:47:07 - 14:47:12]
here is that we have like gr row yeah

[14:47:10 - 14:47:13]
okay so blocks have layouts and these

[14:47:12 - 14:47:15]
are its components under or like these

[14:47:13 - 14:47:16]
are these things underneath okay so that

[14:47:15 - 14:47:20]
kind of makes

[14:47:16 - 14:47:20]
sense so we have an

[14:47:20 - 14:47:26]
accordion okay so we could try adding

[14:47:22 - 14:47:26]
this in here and see what

[14:47:26 - 14:47:31]
happens okay so that's one element that

[14:47:29 - 14:47:36]
we could add um we have

[14:47:31 - 14:47:36]
column let's go try adding that in

[14:47:36 - 14:47:41]
here okay this is all just nonsense so

[14:47:39 - 14:47:44]
far hopefully this doesn't break her app

[14:47:41 - 14:47:46]
uh what else do we have we have the

[14:47:44 - 14:47:49]
group we could do that as well I'm not

[14:47:46 - 14:47:52]
sure if we already have a group in

[14:47:49 - 14:47:56]
there I don't necessarily see

[14:47:52 - 14:47:56]
one but we'll go ahead and do

[14:47:58 - 14:48:02]
that we oh we have tab that's kind of

[14:48:00 - 14:48:04]
cool we'll go ahead and grab

[14:48:02 - 14:48:05]
that I'm not sure how it's going to load

[14:48:04 - 14:48:06]
those images because we don't actually

[14:48:05 - 14:48:09]
have those images so that might error

[14:48:06 - 14:48:12]
out because we don't have um those

[14:48:09 - 14:48:15]
images okay so uh there's also

[14:48:12 - 14:48:17]
render um render is probably looks like

[14:48:15 - 14:48:19]
it's a decorator so uh yeah it is a

[14:48:17 - 14:48:21]
decorator TI Dynamic layout so the

[14:48:19 - 14:48:23]
component that the vent list the app

[14:48:21 - 14:48:25]
changes bit depending on the

[14:48:23 - 14:48:26]
logic okay so that one's a little bit

[14:48:25 - 14:48:28]
more complex I'm not sure if I would

[14:48:26 - 14:48:29]
want to show that to you right now but

[14:48:28 - 14:48:31]
we'll go ahead and stop this and see if

[14:48:29 - 14:48:32]
this just works

[14:48:31 - 14:48:35]
so it says with as

[14:48:32 - 14:48:37]
demo uh we just have a duplicate line

[14:48:35 - 14:48:39]
here and this is also duplicate line

[14:48:37 - 14:48:43]
there so we'll take that

[14:48:39 - 14:48:46]
out we'll try this

[14:48:43 - 14:48:49]
again we'll see if it takes it okay it

[14:48:46 - 14:48:51]
does and let's see what uh mess we have

[14:48:49 - 14:48:53]
here okay so we have something very

[14:48:51 - 14:48:55]
complex as you can see again I really

[14:48:53 - 14:48:57]
don't like this theme too much but uh

[14:48:55 - 14:48:59]
you're kind kind to see like what these

[14:48:57 - 14:49:02]
things do so that's kind of blocks for

[14:48:59 - 14:49:03]
you let's go back to the main list here

[14:49:02 - 14:49:04]
as they were telling us there were some

[14:49:03 - 14:49:05]
other components that we might be

[14:49:04 - 14:49:09]
interested

[14:49:05 - 14:49:09]
in it was back over

[14:49:10 - 14:49:14]
here so we have chat interface which is

[14:49:12 - 14:49:17]
next let's take a look at this

[14:49:14 - 14:49:18]
one I mean text text box is not that

[14:49:17 - 14:49:21]
interesting but I'm going to assume that

[14:49:18 - 14:49:23]
chat interface gives us a chat

[14:49:21 - 14:49:26]
interface so we'll go ahead and do that

[14:49:23 - 14:49:31]
so see new folder or new

[14:49:26 - 14:49:33]
file chat interface. py

[14:49:31 - 14:49:37]
we'll paste that in here and then we'll

[14:49:33 - 14:49:40]
just back out here so um we'll

[14:49:37 - 14:49:44]
say python chat

[14:49:40 - 14:49:44]
interface dop

[14:49:46 - 14:49:50]
whoops okay we'll go back over to here

[14:49:48 - 14:49:52]
we'll give this a hard refresh and so

[14:49:50 - 14:49:54]
now we should have a chat interface

[14:49:52 - 14:49:56]
again I really apologize for the the

[14:49:54 - 14:49:59]
lack of contrast here but this is what I

[14:49:56 - 14:50:00]
have so ola hello okay so we click the

[14:49:59 - 14:50:02]
button and then it put into the chat and

[14:50:00 - 14:50:04]
can say hi but there's I'm not talking

[14:50:02 - 14:50:05]
anybody here so this is not going to

[14:50:04 - 14:50:06]
really do a whole lot but you can see

[14:50:05 - 14:50:09]
we're having a back and forth

[14:50:06 - 14:50:13]
conversation here

[14:50:09 - 14:50:13]
um so that's pretty darn

[14:50:14 - 14:50:18]
straightforward okay that's just

[14:50:16 - 14:50:22]
slightly formatted

[14:50:18 - 14:50:22]
differently so there's

[14:50:25 - 14:50:30]
that and go back to the main docs here I

[14:50:28 - 14:50:31]
kind of lost where we were go back to

[14:50:30 - 14:50:34]
Doc

[14:50:31 - 14:50:35]
chat interface image audio data Frame

[14:50:34 - 14:50:39]
data frame might be interesting this

[14:50:35 - 14:50:39]
component displays a table of value

[14:50:40 - 14:50:45]
spreadsheets I mean that's just a very

[14:50:42 - 14:50:47]
specific type of

[14:50:45 - 14:50:49]
component yeah you can see we have a lot

[14:50:47 - 14:50:50]
of different components and so basically

[14:50:49 - 14:50:52]
they there's inputs and outputs and we

[14:50:50 - 14:50:55]
just have to be able to map things to

[14:50:52 - 14:50:57]
it okay so maybe what we should do is

[14:50:55 - 14:51:00]
try to build something really simple in

[14:50:57 - 14:51:02]
this um so let's actually try to build

[14:51:00 - 14:51:02]
something for

[14:51:02 - 14:51:06]
now I said that you can use something

[14:51:04 - 14:51:08]
like chat GPT so maybe that's something

[14:51:06 - 14:51:10]
we will do here today I'm actually going

[14:51:08 - 14:51:13]
to use Google let's use meta AI let's

[14:51:10 - 14:51:16]
see if it can do it and I'm just going

[14:51:13 - 14:51:21]
to tell it to like uh you know uh write

[14:51:16 - 14:51:24]
me a uh chat interface using

[14:51:21 - 14:51:24]
gradio

[14:51:25 - 14:51:31]
um and it should work with well I'm

[14:51:29 - 14:51:33]
trying to decide here what this could

[14:51:31 - 14:51:34]
work with um open

[14:51:33 - 14:51:37]
[Music]

[14:51:34 - 14:51:40]
AI um in like uh open

[14:51:37 - 14:51:44]
[Music]

[14:51:40 - 14:51:44]
AI with open AI okay we'll try

[14:51:46 - 14:51:50]
that because now we have a general

[14:51:48 - 14:51:51]
understanding of how this works so I'm

[14:51:50 - 14:51:54]
going to go ahead and copy this here now

[14:51:51 - 14:51:56]
if you don't have an API for open API

[14:51:54 - 14:51:58]
this is not going to work for you but

[14:51:56 - 14:52:00]
I'm going to go ahead here and just say

[14:51:58 - 14:52:01]
open AI or we'll just say uh real like

[14:52:00 - 14:52:05]
real

[14:52:01 - 14:52:08]
chat we say chat. here and it'll paste

[14:52:05 - 14:52:10]
this code in here so we have here gradio

[14:52:08 - 14:52:13]
open AI we have our API key that we can

[14:52:10 - 14:52:15]
utilize here we have open AI chat

[14:52:13 - 14:52:18]
completion so the idea is that we have

[14:52:15 - 14:52:20]
the chat bot which is its inputs I think

[14:52:18 - 14:52:23]
this is just inputs here like if we did

[14:52:20 - 14:52:24]
this this is inputs maybe it's not

[14:52:23 - 14:52:25]
actually um because that other one's

[14:52:24 - 14:52:28]
slightly different we'd have to go check

[14:52:25 - 14:52:29]
the documentation here so we go to chat

[14:52:28 - 14:52:31]
interface let's look at its

[14:52:29 - 14:52:34]
initialization

[14:52:31 - 14:52:37]
oh so it's function okay with python you

[14:52:34 - 14:52:39]
don't have to explicitly name things but

[14:52:37 - 14:52:40]
this this function here is function

[14:52:39 - 14:52:41]
right but it's going to mess up because

[14:52:40 - 14:52:45]
we'd have to change all of these like

[14:52:41 - 14:52:47]
this so the first one is the function

[14:52:45 - 14:52:49]
one

[14:52:47 - 14:52:52]
um I mean it doesn't say it's multimod

[14:52:49 - 14:52:54]
next I'm not sure what it's taking next

[14:52:52 - 14:52:56]
it must be taking the text box here so

[14:52:54 - 14:52:57]
we have our input or response or title

[14:52:56 - 14:52:59]
or

[14:52:57 - 14:53:01]
description and this here is trying to

[14:52:59 - 14:53:04]
use da Vinci

[14:53:01 - 14:53:08]
okay so I mean Da Vinci is fine but

[14:53:04 - 14:53:09]
that's kind of a very dumb model um but

[14:53:08 - 14:53:12]
I'm going to make my way over to open

[14:53:09 - 14:53:14]
aai and they might have a free tier I'm

[14:53:12 - 14:53:18]
not sure if they do to get to log in

[14:53:14 - 14:53:20]
here it's kind of hidden um think you

[14:53:18 - 14:53:22]
click that logo no maybe it's under

[14:53:20 - 14:53:24]
products it's almost like they don't

[14:53:22 - 14:53:26]
want you to use open Ai and so I'm

[14:53:24 - 14:53:28]
actually in the API log you'd have to

[14:53:26 - 14:53:31]
create an account to have the

[14:53:28 - 14:53:37]
API and they might have a free teer does

[14:53:31 - 14:53:37]
open AI API have a free tier let's find

[14:53:39 - 14:53:44]
out uh they

[14:53:42 - 14:53:46]
might but anyway I know that I have my

[14:53:44 - 14:53:48]
own account here so I'm just going to go

[14:53:46 - 14:53:51]
ahead and log in going log in with

[14:53:48 - 14:53:52]
Google I believe as my account if I

[14:53:51 - 14:53:56]
don't it's a new account that's totally

[14:53:52 - 14:53:58]
fine and so I need to create myself a

[14:53:56 - 14:54:01]
new

[14:53:58 - 14:54:03]
project so I'm going to go to

[14:54:01 - 14:54:06]
[Music]

[14:54:03 - 14:54:10]
where is this I can create a new project

[14:54:06 - 14:54:10]
here this just be um

[14:54:11 - 14:54:16]
gradio and from here I need to generate

[14:54:13 - 14:54:16]
out a new

[14:54:17 - 14:54:21]
[Music]

[14:54:24 - 14:54:29]
key it's a little bit of a mess so it's

[14:54:26 - 14:54:32]
a bit hard to see what I'm doing I going

[14:54:29 - 14:54:32]
go to manage projects

[14:54:33 - 14:54:38]
we have API Keys up here but if I click

[14:54:35 - 14:54:38]
into this

[14:54:39 - 14:54:47]
project okay this is fine but I need my

[14:54:43 - 14:54:49]
API key so I click here and I go to API

[14:54:47 - 14:54:50]
keys I already have a key that I

[14:54:49 - 14:54:52]
generated out for another use I'm going

[14:54:50 - 14:54:55]
to go create this one here today this is

[14:54:52 - 14:54:56]
going to be called gradio example and

[14:54:55 - 14:54:58]
I'm going to scope this based on this

[14:54:56 - 14:55:00]
project here the gradio one I'm going to

[14:54:58 - 14:55:02]
give it uh full access here I'm going to

[14:55:00 - 14:55:03]
get this secret I'm going to delete the

[14:55:02 - 14:55:06]
secret later so it's not a big deal if

[14:55:03 - 14:55:08]
you see it and I need to bring this back

[14:55:06 - 14:55:09]
over to my code now we should load this

[14:55:08 - 14:55:13]
via environment variable so I'm just

[14:55:09 - 14:55:16]
going to stop this here and I'm going to

[14:55:13 - 14:55:18]
export this variable into open API

[14:55:16 - 14:55:20]
key um well you know what actually I'd

[14:55:18 - 14:55:22]
rather load this in as an environment

[14:55:20 - 14:55:24]
variable so I'm going to gov I'll make

[14:55:22 - 14:55:25]
an example here and there's usually

[14:55:24 - 14:55:28]
three things we have to set we have the

[14:55:25 - 14:55:31]
orc ID the project ID and then the open

[14:55:28 - 14:55:33]
API key

[14:55:31 - 14:55:35]
and um obviously these will be examples

[14:55:33 - 14:55:38]
but I'm going to create a new one here

[14:55:35 - 14:55:40]
just so that um I'm not uh causing

[14:55:38 - 14:55:43]
myself some issues

[14:55:40 - 14:55:46]
here

[14:55:43 - 14:55:49]
okay and I'm just going to go ahead and

[14:55:46 - 14:55:50]
make a new file here called Dog

[14:55:49 - 14:55:53]
ignore

[14:55:50 - 14:55:53]
get

[14:55:54 - 14:56:00]
ignore get ignore and we are going to

[14:55:57 - 14:56:02]
ignore the EnV file

[14:56:00 - 14:56:05]
okay just so we don't commit that and

[14:56:02 - 14:56:07]
then I need to paste in this so um

[14:56:05 - 14:56:11]
there's probably very

[14:56:07 - 14:56:14]
specific uh Nars for open

[14:56:11 - 14:56:14]
API uh

[14:56:16 - 14:56:21]
here yeah like this one's called open

[14:56:18 - 14:56:23]
API

[14:56:21 - 14:56:26]
key worst case we can just set them

[14:56:23 - 14:56:28]
manually um

[14:56:26 - 14:56:30]
API normally a lot of libraries will

[14:56:28 - 14:56:32]
have default ones and then you load them

[14:56:30 - 14:56:36]
in here yeah this one says open

[14:56:32 - 14:56:39]
API um so we will grab that one here and

[14:56:36 - 14:56:43]
I'm going to go back over to uh GitHub

[14:56:39 - 14:56:43]
code spaces which is what we're in here

[14:56:44 - 14:56:49]
today and then there's obviously an org

[14:56:46 - 14:56:50]
ID which we'll need or ID and then

[14:56:49 - 14:56:53]
project

[14:56:50 - 14:56:55]
ID before all you needed was a single

[14:56:53 - 14:56:56]
key but now I believe that you need all

[14:56:55 - 14:57:00]
three and you should use all three if

[14:56:56 - 14:57:03]
you can um so in here I need to go back

[14:57:00 - 14:57:06]
to well we need this project here so

[14:57:03 - 14:57:09]
I'll go back to manage

[14:57:06 - 14:57:11]
projects and this is just loading at

[14:57:09 - 14:57:13]
projects and so this is the ID of the

[14:57:11 - 14:57:16]
project I'm going to grab this here I'm

[14:57:13 - 14:57:18]
going to bring this on over to here nope

[14:57:16 - 14:57:21]
not

[14:57:18 - 14:57:24]
there this is the project ID and then I

[14:57:21 - 14:57:27]
also need the or

[14:57:24 - 14:57:30]
ID which is over

[14:57:27 - 14:57:32]
here so tons and tons of keys

[14:57:30 - 14:57:34]
so now that I have those three keys I

[14:57:32 - 14:57:35]
need to configure it so that it uses all

[14:57:34 - 14:57:37]
those I'll go back over to here we can

[14:57:35 - 14:57:39]
see that's using this I don't think it's

[14:57:37 - 14:57:41]
a Capital C but to be fair meta might

[14:57:39 - 14:57:43]
code might be a little bit out of date

[14:57:41 - 14:57:45]
here but it did give us the basis of

[14:57:43 - 14:57:46]
something so that's totally fine and we

[14:57:45 - 14:57:47]
see open API being configured that way

[14:57:46 - 14:57:55]
so I'm going to go over here and say

[14:57:47 - 14:57:55]
like open a uh AI um API

[14:57:55 - 14:58:02]
reference okay and in here we're it's

[14:57:59 - 14:58:05]
going back oh it's right up here okay

[14:58:02 - 14:58:06]
and so I'm looking for how we configure

[14:58:05 - 14:58:08]
this so this you can see this is a

[14:58:06 - 14:58:10]
little bit different actually GPT 40

[14:58:08 - 14:58:12]
mini is probably what I want to use so

[14:58:10 - 14:58:17]
I'm actually going to copy this

[14:58:12 - 14:58:20]
here and um go back over to our code

[14:58:17 - 14:58:20]
base which is over

[14:58:20 - 14:58:23]
here and paste it

[14:58:25 - 14:58:30]
in and so this one's called I'm just

[14:58:27 - 14:58:32]
going to name it open a AI here uh

[14:58:30 - 14:58:33]
prefer client to be honest I'll bring

[14:58:32 - 14:58:36]
this on down here I'm just going to

[14:58:33 - 14:58:38]
ignore

[14:58:36 - 14:58:40]
this now I'd rather have this streaming

[14:58:38 - 14:58:43]
to be

[14:58:40 - 14:58:43]
honest

[14:58:45 - 14:58:49]
so bring this over

[14:58:50 - 14:58:54]
here and I just know from experience

[14:58:52 - 14:58:57]
that um it takes all three but we need

[14:58:54 - 14:59:01]
to set those somewhere

[14:58:57 - 14:59:01]
[Music]

[14:59:04 - 14:59:07]
so let's go to

[14:59:10 - 14:59:13]
authentication

[14:59:14 - 14:59:22]
okay here we go so this is where we are

[14:59:18 - 14:59:25]
setting our keys what about our other

[14:59:22 - 14:59:25]
one our actual main

[14:59:25 - 14:59:31]
one H okay that's fine so maybe we'll

[14:59:29 - 14:59:33]
pick up the one like the environment

[14:59:31 - 14:59:34]
variable one will pick up over here but

[14:59:33 - 14:59:37]
we'll explicitly set

[14:59:34 - 14:59:42]
up the orc here so in here this is like

[14:59:37 - 14:59:46]
import I believe import OS and then this

[14:59:42 - 14:59:48]
here is os. Enron Square braces and this

[14:59:46 - 14:59:51]
would be org ID as that's what we called

[14:59:48 - 14:59:53]
it and then here this would be OS

[14:59:51 - 14:59:57]
Environ and I believe it's Square braces

[14:59:53 - 14:59:59]
it might be uh oh no you know what it's

[14:59:57 - 15:00:02]
doget I don't know how I know that it's

[14:59:59 - 15:00:03]
that but I know that it's that doget and

[15:00:02 - 15:00:06]
we'll say project

[15:00:03 - 15:00:08]
ID okay and so we're not explicitly

[15:00:06 - 15:00:09]
setting the API key this way I'm going

[15:00:08 - 15:00:11]
to assume that it's just going to get

[15:00:09 - 15:00:13]
loaded into the Nars and it'll just

[15:00:11 - 15:00:16]
implicitly

[15:00:13 - 15:00:18]
know uh one thing I would like to know

[15:00:16 - 15:00:19]
is how can we set up this interface this

[15:00:18 - 15:00:20]
chat interface to be streaming now this

[15:00:19 - 15:00:22]
just says

[15:00:20 - 15:00:25]
interface is that correct because this

[15:00:22 - 15:00:26]
one's called chat interface so it makes

[15:00:25 - 15:00:27]
me think that meta didn't produce the

[15:00:26 - 15:00:30]
correct code and so it wasn't

[15:00:27 - 15:00:31]
intelligent enough to do it sorry meta I

[15:00:30 - 15:00:35]
guess you're the wrong one to do it

[15:00:31 - 15:00:38]
let's go over to G uh uh

[15:00:35 - 15:00:42]
Gemini

[15:00:38 - 15:00:42]
Gemini and I'm G to give it its

[15:00:43 - 15:00:52]
code okay so uh can you fix my code so

[15:00:48 - 15:00:53]
that so that gradio is using the correct

[15:00:52 - 15:00:57]
chat

[15:00:53 - 15:00:59]
interface and it's hooked up for

[15:00:57 - 15:01:01]
streaming cuz it clearly isn't hooked up

[15:00:59 - 15:01:03]
for streaming and I can only imagine

[15:01:01 - 15:01:07]
that gradio can do

[15:01:03 - 15:01:10]
streaming so here we have updated

[15:01:07 - 15:01:12]
code um open a API uh response I'm not

[15:01:10 - 15:01:16]
sure why we need that

[15:01:12 - 15:01:16]
there this is still using

[15:01:18 - 15:01:23]
interface okay that can't be right

[15:01:19 - 15:01:27]
because this is interface uh you aren't

[15:01:23 - 15:01:31]
using chat interface why not is there a

[15:01:27 - 15:01:31]
reason why you're not going to use it

[15:01:33 - 15:01:38]
okay so this looks a lot better but this

[15:01:36 - 15:01:40]
is where like it helps actually know and

[15:01:38 - 15:01:41]
explored the code first and if we hadn't

[15:01:40 - 15:01:43]
done that we would probably thought

[15:01:41 - 15:01:45]
interface was totally fine so I'll paste

[15:01:43 - 15:01:46]
this in here and the code's a little bit

[15:01:45 - 15:01:47]
different I don't know if we really need

[15:01:46 - 15:01:48]
this in fact I don't think it's even

[15:01:47 - 15:01:51]
being

[15:01:48 - 15:01:54]
used right away I knew that made no

[15:01:51 - 15:01:56]
sense

[15:01:54 - 15:01:57]
um also oh you know what it's saying it

[15:01:56 - 15:01:58]
can't be resolved because we haven't

[15:01:57 - 15:02:02]
installed it yet so we got to go back

[15:01:58 - 15:02:04]
over here to this andad say open

[15:02:02 - 15:02:06]
AI okay so then we'll go back over to

[15:02:04 - 15:02:06]
our

[15:02:07 - 15:02:11]
chat. and so it's using the the the

[15:02:09 - 15:02:13]
usual structured interface so that kind

[15:02:11 - 15:02:16]
of looks correct to me it's passing the

[15:02:13 - 15:02:19]
messages in so that looks good as

[15:02:16 - 15:02:21]
well um how do how do we know that it

[15:02:19 - 15:02:22]
accepts streaming I don't know so like I

[15:02:21 - 15:02:23]
would think that you'd have to do

[15:02:22 - 15:02:25]
something special to do streaming so I'm

[15:02:23 - 15:02:26]
going to go back over to here did it

[15:02:25 - 15:02:28]
just get rid of streaming no it still

[15:02:26 - 15:02:32]
has streaming on

[15:02:28 - 15:02:34]
here um and so I would go back over to

[15:02:32 - 15:02:38]
gradio I'm going to type in

[15:02:34 - 15:02:38]
stream so here's an example of chat

[15:02:39 - 15:02:45]
streaming so there's no specific setting

[15:02:43 - 15:02:48]
for streaming it just seems like maybe

[15:02:45 - 15:02:48]
it just knows how to

[15:02:49 - 15:02:54]
stream okay so let's go back over to

[15:02:52 - 15:02:58]
here and let's go ahead and start this

[15:02:54 - 15:02:58]
and see if it works

[15:03:01 - 15:03:05]
no module named open

[15:03:08 - 15:03:14]
AI well oh did we do our pip first

[15:03:11 - 15:03:17]
pip pip install hyphen R

[15:03:14 - 15:03:17]
requirements.txt

[15:03:18 - 15:03:25]
okay and then we'll try to start this

[15:03:21 - 15:03:27]
again now if we use Claud son it 3.5 the

[15:03:25 - 15:03:29]
latest version I bet it would get this

[15:03:27 - 15:03:30]
the first try but again we're just

[15:03:29 - 15:03:31]
trying to try different models and see

[15:03:30 - 15:03:34]
what

[15:03:31 - 15:03:36]
happens um as that's just a good way to

[15:03:34 - 15:03:36]
test things in

[15:03:37 - 15:03:42]
general okay so here it says the API key

[15:03:41 - 15:03:46]
option must be set either by passing the

[15:03:42 - 15:03:47]
API value or the open AI API key

[15:03:46 - 15:03:49]
environment variable oh you know why

[15:03:47 - 15:03:51]
this didn't work is that we didn't add a

[15:03:49 - 15:03:53]
way to load environment variable so

[15:03:51 - 15:03:55]
we'll type in python. EnV why it's

[15:03:53 - 15:03:58]
called python. EnV I don't know but when

[15:03:55 - 15:04:00]
you actually import it it is actually

[15:03:58 - 15:04:01]
called uh just EnV which is kind of

[15:04:00 - 15:04:06]
annoying so we'll go over to here and

[15:04:01 - 15:04:09]
we'll say import. EnV and we'll say Dov

[15:04:06 - 15:04:12]
load Dov

[15:04:09 - 15:04:14]
parenthesis and um that should work now

[15:04:12 - 15:04:15]
good so we'll go ahead and hit up and so

[15:04:14 - 15:04:18]
that should load in the environment

[15:04:15 - 15:04:19]
variables it looks like we got no not an

[15:04:18 - 15:04:21]
error but we'll go back here and now run

[15:04:19 - 15:04:23]
the

[15:04:21 - 15:04:25]
app and so now it's started on this

[15:04:23 - 15:04:27]
other Port we'll go back over to here

[15:04:25 - 15:04:30]
we'll give this a hard refresh we'll see

[15:04:27 - 15:04:30]
what we have

[15:04:30 - 15:04:35]
great and so now this should be hooked

[15:04:33 - 15:04:38]
up uh to this one thing I don't like is

[15:04:35 - 15:04:39]
how hard it is to see stuff here so I

[15:04:38 - 15:04:43]
want to get a better theme in here so

[15:04:39 - 15:04:47]
we'll say uh I'll go back over to Gemini

[15:04:43 - 15:04:51]
can you create a high

[15:04:47 - 15:04:55]
contrast um theme for gradio because

[15:04:51 - 15:04:58]
it's hard to see the default one okay

[15:04:55 - 15:05:01]
let's see if it can do that at

[15:04:58 - 15:05:03]
least and so here here we have a much

[15:05:01 - 15:05:03]
higher

[15:05:05 - 15:05:10]
one and so I'm hoping what we can

[15:05:11 - 15:05:14]
do okay I'm going to copy this here I'm

[15:05:13 - 15:05:17]
not sure if it's going to work but I'm

[15:05:14 - 15:05:17]
going to copy it

[15:05:18 - 15:05:23]
here

[15:05:20 - 15:05:24]
and maybe we can pass them in here let's

[15:05:23 - 15:05:26]
just go check the API to find out if

[15:05:24 - 15:05:30]
that's the

[15:05:26 - 15:05:33]
case we can pass a theme there okay good

[15:05:30 - 15:05:35]
so we'll just say theme and then we'll

[15:05:33 - 15:05:35]
put in

[15:05:35 - 15:05:40]
our where's where custom theme create

[15:05:38 - 15:05:40]
High concious

[15:05:41 - 15:05:48]
theme I'll just say High theme

[15:05:44 - 15:05:50]
here and I'm just going to go grab this

[15:05:48 - 15:05:52]
function and we'll go down below just to

[15:05:50 - 15:05:53]
see if we can make it a little bit more

[15:05:52 - 15:05:57]
readable because it is a little bit hard

[15:05:53 - 15:06:01]
to see High

[15:05:57 - 15:06:01]
theme okay we'll start this up

[15:06:03 - 15:06:08]
give us a nice hard

[15:06:05 - 15:06:11]
refresh

[15:06:08 - 15:06:12]
uh I would not call this a high contrast

[15:06:11 - 15:06:14]
theme I would call this really hard to

[15:06:12 - 15:06:16]
see but maybe what we could do is adjust

[15:06:14 - 15:06:19]
this ourselves because clearly it's not

[15:06:16 - 15:06:24]
listening to us

[15:06:19 - 15:06:28]
um yeah it it's using the soft

[15:06:24 - 15:06:32]
theme okay what are the default themes

[15:06:28 - 15:06:34]
Dr okay let's Let's uh see what it has

[15:06:32 - 15:06:36]
here these are just terrible these

[15:06:34 - 15:06:38]
themes I don't want soft is there

[15:06:36 - 15:06:43]
anything beside oh we have base default

[15:06:38 - 15:06:43]
origin Citrus monochrome soft glass

[15:06:49 - 15:06:56]
ocean can we at least see the

[15:06:53 - 15:06:58]
theme dark mode yeah I'd love that can I

[15:06:56 - 15:07:00]
just have

[15:06:58 - 15:07:03]
that like this this one's even better

[15:07:00 - 15:07:03]
okay how do I get this

[15:07:05 - 15:07:09]
one okay great can I have that

[15:07:11 - 15:07:17]
theme left panel is where you create the

[15:07:13 - 15:07:17]
theme the different aspects of the

[15:07:18 - 15:07:24]
theme okay can I have it please may I

[15:07:21 - 15:07:24]
have it how do I get

[15:07:26 - 15:07:30]
it the strange of the Dark theme is

[15:07:28 - 15:07:32]
easier I I mean it looks like it's just

[15:07:30 - 15:07:34]
base theme dark theme to be honest so

[15:07:32 - 15:07:36]
maybe what we can do is just go back

[15:07:34 - 15:07:36]
over to

[15:07:37 - 15:07:44]
here how to set Dark theme on gradio I

[15:07:41 - 15:07:44]
not sure why this is so darn

[15:07:45 - 15:07:50]
hard maybe you can't force it you have

[15:07:47 - 15:07:50]
to have a toggle or

[15:07:54 - 15:07:59]
something oh this is so silly

[15:08:00 - 15:08:03]
because I want to be able to see what

[15:08:01 - 15:08:05]
I'm doing and it's just like really hard

[15:08:03 - 15:08:06]
to see anything all right well I'll just

[15:08:05 - 15:08:09]
take out my custom theme because that

[15:08:06 - 15:08:10]
clearly is is nonsense here I mean like

[15:08:09 - 15:08:12]
we could get it to work it'll just take

[15:08:10 - 15:08:16]
a lot more time but I do apologize I

[15:08:12 - 15:08:20]
find again this very hard to see and I I

[15:08:16 - 15:08:20]
just realized that that's unfortunate

[15:08:20 - 15:08:24]
so we'll give this a moment

[15:08:25 - 15:08:33]
here okay so let's see if this works

[15:08:29 - 15:08:38]
hello uh I want to learn

[15:08:33 - 15:08:41]
Japanese can you teach me some basic

[15:08:38 - 15:08:44]
phrases let's go ahead andit enter and

[15:08:41 - 15:08:47]
we got an error yeah no

[15:08:44 - 15:08:51]
surprise so it says

[15:08:47 - 15:08:51]
here uh not values to

[15:08:56 - 15:09:01]
unpack okay so something is clearly

[15:08:58 - 15:09:02]
wrong with this assistant message yeah I

[15:09:01 - 15:09:04]
don't think this did a good job so what

[15:09:02 - 15:09:05]
I'm going to do is copy this here let's

[15:09:04 - 15:09:08]
go over to something that actually can

[15:09:05 - 15:09:11]
make good code we'll go over to Claude

[15:09:08 - 15:09:11]
AI

[15:09:12 - 15:09:18]
um this code is not working can you help

[15:09:16 - 15:09:18]
me

[15:09:18 - 15:09:24]
out and let's see if claw can solve it

[15:09:21 - 15:09:24]
cla's really really good at

[15:09:25 - 15:09:30]
coding I just want to see if it figures

[15:09:27 - 15:09:30]
out what's wrong

[15:09:33 - 15:09:37]
uh change the organization project to

[15:09:35 - 15:09:37]
using the

[15:09:39 - 15:09:45]
API no that's not right fix the model

[15:09:42 - 15:09:48]
name gp40 to gp4 there isn't a model

[15:09:45 - 15:09:51]
called GPT 40 mini I mean there

[15:09:48 - 15:09:51]
definitely is so that's

[15:09:51 - 15:09:56]
wrong using Delta con instead of text to

[15:09:54 - 15:09:59]
access the stream content add a check

[15:09:56 - 15:09:59]
none

[15:10:02 - 15:10:07]
um no I mean you're wrong on many

[15:10:09 - 15:10:13]
parts I just want to solve this

[15:10:14 - 15:10:18]
problem so we go back over to our

[15:10:16 - 15:10:21]
example here we'll see what's going on

[15:10:18 - 15:10:21]
here so it's like

[15:10:24 - 15:10:30]
this and we'll see what it

[15:10:27 - 15:10:32]
says so it's putting my code back to

[15:10:30 - 15:10:34]
normal which is

[15:10:32 - 15:10:36]
good so it says here change the

[15:10:34 - 15:10:37]
parameter order to match gradio

[15:10:36 - 15:10:40]
expectation simplify the history

[15:10:37 - 15:10:42]
handling okay so this looks a lot

[15:10:40 - 15:10:44]
better um so maybe yeah again it just

[15:10:42 - 15:10:47]
was not compatible with the way gradio

[15:10:44 - 15:10:49]
handles the code so we go back over to

[15:10:47 - 15:10:51]
here I think what it's changing is this

[15:10:49 - 15:10:53]
component right here that part there so

[15:10:51 - 15:10:56]
we'll go back and and paste it

[15:10:53 - 15:10:59]
in uh yeah it looks a bit different for

[15:10:56 - 15:10:59]
sure

[15:11:01 - 15:11:05]
okay um I think I might have lost that

[15:11:03 - 15:11:05]
code

[15:11:07 - 15:11:11]
there we'll go ahead and paste this in

[15:11:09 - 15:11:13]
again and I'm going to stop this start

[15:11:11 - 15:11:15]
this again if it doesn't work then we'll

[15:11:13 - 15:11:19]
manually debug it because um you know

[15:11:15 - 15:11:23]
again these things don't always work as

[15:11:19 - 15:11:29]
expected can you teach me some basic

[15:11:23 - 15:11:30]
Japanese phrases for uh restaurants

[15:11:29 - 15:11:33]
let's see if that

[15:11:30 - 15:11:36]
works is it going to stream and we got

[15:11:33 - 15:11:38]
another error so it's interesting that

[15:11:36 - 15:11:40]
it can't solve it here Choice object has

[15:11:38 - 15:11:43]
no tribute

[15:11:40 - 15:11:44]
text okay so let's take a look here and

[15:11:43 - 15:11:46]
see what we have so we have this

[15:11:44 - 15:11:50]
configured this is totally fine we have

[15:11:46 - 15:11:53]
user assistant which might be correct we

[15:11:50 - 15:11:56]
have add the uh pending message that's

[15:11:53 - 15:11:58]
fine we have client completion and we're

[15:11:56 - 15:12:01]
passing back a stream in the Stream we

[15:11:58 - 15:12:06]
are iterating through it and we're doing

[15:12:01 - 15:12:06]
this Choice object has no attribute

[15:12:21 - 15:12:26]
text I mean there's nothing in here

[15:12:25 - 15:12:30]
where we're setting choice right so

[15:12:26 - 15:12:31]
that's why it's kind of confusing

[15:12:30 - 15:12:34]
and we're not even uh defining the the

[15:12:31 - 15:12:37]
text like any text boxes so let's go

[15:12:34 - 15:12:39]
back over to here let's go tell Claud

[15:12:37 - 15:12:43]
that we have this error and see if it

[15:12:39 - 15:12:43]
can figure out what the problem is

[15:12:43 - 15:12:49]
now okay so it's that delta. content

[15:12:46 - 15:12:51]
issue that it's adjusting

[15:12:49 - 15:12:53]
again which is over here so I imagine

[15:12:51 - 15:12:54]
what it's changed is just this part so

[15:12:53 - 15:12:57]
let's just grab the part that it's

[15:12:54 - 15:12:57]
changed

[15:12:59 - 15:13:03]
oh choices here okay that's what it was

[15:13:01 - 15:13:06]
talking about choices. text all right it

[15:13:03 - 15:13:07]
wasn't clicking there for a second ago

[15:13:06 - 15:13:09]
okay so we'll still stop this we'll try

[15:13:07 - 15:13:11]
this

[15:13:09 - 15:13:12]
again and we'll go back here and I'm

[15:13:11 - 15:13:15]
just going to copy this text I'm going

[15:13:12 - 15:13:15]
to give this a hard

[15:13:16 - 15:13:20]
refresh and we'll paste this in again

[15:13:18 - 15:13:22]
we'll hit

[15:13:20 - 15:13:23]
enter and there we go so now we have our

[15:13:22 - 15:13:26]
little

[15:13:23 - 15:13:28]
chat um could we take this a bit further

[15:13:26 - 15:13:33]
one thing that I would really like is to

[15:13:28 - 15:13:33]
add on the left hand inside a um image

[15:13:33 - 15:13:38]
generation yeah maybe we can take it a

[15:13:35 - 15:13:40]
little bit further so we know that we

[15:13:38 - 15:13:42]
can create like a leftand column like we

[15:13:40 - 15:13:43]
can create uh we can use blocks to

[15:13:42 - 15:13:45]
create a column so I think maybe what I

[15:13:43 - 15:13:46]
might want to see is like an

[15:13:45 - 15:13:49]
image

[15:13:46 - 15:13:49]
and

[15:13:50 - 15:13:58]
um let's see if we can ask cl to do this

[15:13:53 - 15:13:59]
so can you add an image to the left

[15:13:58 - 15:14:04]
column

[15:13:59 - 15:14:09]
can we have uh two

[15:14:04 - 15:14:10]
columns one for image and one for chat

[15:14:09 - 15:14:15]
um I want

[15:14:10 - 15:14:18]
to um generate an

[15:14:15 - 15:14:21]
image from the

[15:14:18 - 15:14:26]
response of the of the last chat

[15:14:21 - 15:14:26]
message returned by the

[15:14:26 - 15:14:31]
assistant okay and so I just don't know

[15:14:29 - 15:14:33]
how the outputs will work but let's see

[15:14:31 - 15:14:35]
what it does and then read through it

[15:14:33 - 15:14:37]
but obviously we would use that block

[15:14:35 - 15:14:38]
thing as we saw before yeah so there's

[15:14:37 - 15:14:41]
our

[15:14:38 - 15:14:42]
blocks that's setting up a single row

[15:14:41 - 15:14:44]
and then within it we have a column I

[15:14:42 - 15:14:47]
don't know if we need to have a row here

[15:14:44 - 15:14:52]
that might be um kind of useless here

[15:14:47 - 15:14:54]
but here we have our column which makes

[15:14:52 - 15:14:56]
sense connect the chat box output to the

[15:14:54 - 15:14:58]
image so that's what I didn't know what

[15:14:56 - 15:15:01]
we could do here so when we hit the

[15:14:58 - 15:15:04]
image then it's going to hook up this

[15:15:01 - 15:15:08]
generate image from the last history

[15:15:04 - 15:15:09]
here okay and then Ching Dolly 3 which

[15:15:08 - 15:15:13]
is actually perfect because that's a

[15:15:09 - 15:15:15]
that's an API that's um part of open API

[15:15:13 - 15:15:17]
so let's go ahead and copy this one

[15:15:15 - 15:15:18]
thing I don't think we need is that row

[15:15:17 - 15:15:21]
column but we'll go ahead and see what

[15:15:18 - 15:15:21]
we can do

[15:15:22 - 15:15:27]
here okay so I'm going to try and stop

[15:15:25 - 15:15:29]
this

[15:15:27 - 15:15:32]
here actually before I do that I'm just

[15:15:29 - 15:15:35]
going to undo I'm going to say uh chat

[15:15:32 - 15:15:36]
with image. py and then I'll just paste

[15:15:35 - 15:15:40]
this in again

[15:15:36 - 15:15:43]
here and we'll CD into chat with or not

[15:15:40 - 15:15:44]
CD into but we'll just say python chat

[15:15:43 - 15:15:46]
with image it already is erroring out

[15:15:44 - 15:15:47]
because it doesn't know what chatbot is

[15:15:46 - 15:15:50]
here also it doesn't know what user

[15:15:47 - 15:15:54]
input is either so I'm not sure uh why

[15:15:50 - 15:15:54]
it did that we have it over

[15:15:55 - 15:16:00]
here did you mean submit function uh

[15:15:59 - 15:16:02]
possibly but I don't know what it's

[15:16:00 - 15:16:02]
supposed to

[15:16:03 - 15:16:09]
be okay so clearly it has some old code

[15:16:07 - 15:16:10]
here but we'll go ahead and just ask

[15:16:09 - 15:16:12]
Claude to fix it

[15:16:10 - 15:16:14]
again one thing we might want to check

[15:16:12 - 15:16:17]
here is like we're returning back the

[15:16:14 - 15:16:18]
actual chat interface and so if we go

[15:16:17 - 15:16:20]
back to the documentation this is

[15:16:18 - 15:16:22]
something we can

[15:16:20 - 15:16:24]
check I don't want you to be 100%

[15:16:22 - 15:16:27]
reliant on the

[15:16:24 - 15:16:28]
um on the code so that's why I just

[15:16:27 - 15:16:30]
constantly keep checking the code here

[15:16:28 - 15:16:33]
so that you or sorry not the code but I

[15:16:30 - 15:16:35]
don't want be 100% reliant on uh

[15:16:33 - 15:16:37]
generative AI to code and so that's why

[15:16:35 - 15:16:40]
we constantly keep checking here so this

[15:16:37 - 15:16:41]
returns back an object so what I'm

[15:16:40 - 15:16:43]
trying to figure out from the code is

[15:16:41 - 15:16:46]
what does it

[15:16:43 - 15:16:49]
return so it doesn't tell

[15:16:46 - 15:16:51]
us okay can we get submit anywhere in

[15:16:49 - 15:16:54]
here submit so there is clearly a submit

[15:16:51 - 15:16:58]
button dot on this but that's if we

[15:16:54 - 15:16:58]
initialized it

[15:16:59 - 15:17:03]
so these are components does it tell us

[15:17:00 - 15:17:03]
maybe what it returns it

[15:17:05 - 15:17:11]
doesn't a chat bot with a custom chat

[15:17:08 - 15:17:11]
bot that includes the

[15:17:12 - 15:17:17]
placeholder what does chat interface

[15:17:15 - 15:17:19]
return gradio because it's not showing

[15:17:17 - 15:17:23]
us that easy way to find

[15:17:19 - 15:17:23]
it that's kind of

[15:17:25 - 15:17:30]
frustrating like how would we know what

[15:17:28 - 15:17:33]
we would return here

[15:17:30 - 15:17:34]
here replace chat interface with custom

[15:17:33 - 15:17:36]
chatbot implementation combine the chat

[15:17:34 - 15:17:38]
interface with it yeah so I think it

[15:17:36 - 15:17:40]
made it up because I'm not sure if you

[15:17:38 - 15:17:45]
can just do chat bot and say chat chat

[15:17:40 - 15:17:47]
interface on like that so here we have

[15:17:45 - 15:17:48]
message well first let's just see if

[15:17:47 - 15:17:50]
this works and then the second thing is

[15:17:48 - 15:17:52]
we'll read the code and see if we can

[15:17:50 - 15:17:54]
make sense of

[15:17:52 - 15:17:55]
it but normally what I would do like

[15:17:54 - 15:17:57]
when I'm coding is I would go look up

[15:17:55 - 15:18:00]
and say okay what does it return but the

[15:17:57 - 15:18:00]
documentation doesn't tell us anything

[15:18:02 - 15:18:09]
unless there's like um let's say gradio

[15:18:05 - 15:18:09]
API reference maybe that might be

[15:18:10 - 15:18:16]
better no I would describe this um this

[15:18:13 - 15:18:16]
documentation is not very

[15:18:17 - 15:18:21]
good okay yeah you have a chatbot so

[15:18:20 - 15:18:25]
here's this chat bot. like like where

[15:18:21 - 15:18:25]
does this like come from

[15:18:29 - 15:18:34]
like how do we know what object is being

[15:18:31 - 15:18:37]
returned it just doesn't tell us that's

[15:18:34 - 15:18:39]
very frustrating um so we'll go back

[15:18:37 - 15:18:40]
over to here and I mean maybe if we see

[15:18:39 - 15:18:43]
the component then we know that there's

[15:18:40 - 15:18:46]
a button so if we go to submit

[15:18:43 - 15:18:47]
here there's no submit button in uh in

[15:18:46 - 15:18:49]
particular here and that's why it's

[15:18:47 - 15:18:52]
confusing but we'll go back over to our

[15:18:49 - 15:18:55]
interface and see if it actually

[15:18:52 - 15:18:57]
worked um over here so it says it's

[15:18:55 - 15:18:58]
running so maybe it did work so I'm

[15:18:57 - 15:19:00]
going to go back over here because this

[15:18:58 - 15:19:00]
a hard

[15:19:01 - 15:19:05]
refresh okay so now we have our chat on

[15:19:04 - 15:19:07]
the left hand side and this on the right

[15:19:05 - 15:19:09]
hand side but this is now a custom chat

[15:19:07 - 15:19:11]
it's not that integrated one so our

[15:19:09 - 15:19:14]
experience is not as nice could we have

[15:19:11 - 15:19:16]
used the chat interface possibly I would

[15:19:14 - 15:19:18]
probably want the image on the uh left

[15:19:16 - 15:19:19]
hand side and then the the other one on

[15:19:18 - 15:19:21]
the right so I'm just going to flip that

[15:19:19 - 15:19:23]
around I would also like to try to see

[15:19:21 - 15:19:25]
if I can get rid of this row as I don't

[15:19:23 - 15:19:27]
think it's necessary as we already have

[15:19:25 - 15:19:30]
a single one here so I'm going to go

[15:19:27 - 15:19:31]
here and just flip these around here

[15:19:30 - 15:19:35]
okay and then I'm just going to go ahead

[15:19:31 - 15:19:36]
and stop this so let's see if that row

[15:19:35 - 15:19:39]
was

[15:19:36 - 15:19:39]
useless give that a moment to

[15:19:41 - 15:19:46]
start okay so without the row then they

[15:19:44 - 15:19:48]
it doesn't work okay so that's what I I

[15:19:46 - 15:19:50]
wanted to find out so we'll go back here

[15:19:48 - 15:19:52]
and put the row back in we'll bring back

[15:19:50 - 15:19:55]
our

[15:19:52 - 15:20:00]
indentation I'll stop

[15:19:55 - 15:20:00]
this refresh that we'll start this again

[15:20:02 - 15:20:07]
again and we lost our column but I put

[15:20:06 - 15:20:08]
it right back in there so why can't I

[15:20:07 - 15:20:11]
have it

[15:20:08 - 15:20:14]
back okay well I'll just undo it till I

[15:20:11 - 15:20:14]
go back to this

[15:20:14 - 15:20:19]
one okay so I'll just undo this again

[15:20:16 - 15:20:19]
and restart it back

[15:20:23 - 15:20:28]
up oh come

[15:20:25 - 15:20:30]
on it is not even trying to work here so

[15:20:28 - 15:20:32]
we'll go here I'm just going to taste a

[15:20:30 - 15:20:34]
two spaces tab here first of all I

[15:20:32 - 15:20:37]
really do not like uh four spaces so I'm

[15:20:34 - 15:20:40]
just going to quickly fix that as that's

[15:20:37 - 15:20:40]
kind of bothering

[15:20:41 - 15:20:46]
me but I'm trying to swap the location

[15:20:44 - 15:20:47]
so one's on the left one's on the right

[15:20:46 - 15:20:49]
it seems like it's kind of caching it

[15:20:47 - 15:20:50]
maybe we'll just open up our developer

[15:20:49 - 15:20:52]
environment and they just say to not

[15:20:50 - 15:20:55]
cash it anymore and that might resolve

[15:20:52 - 15:20:59]
our issue here as I'm tediously changing

[15:20:55 - 15:21:01]
the indentation for no particular reason

[15:20:59 - 15:21:03]
uh but yeah I want the image to be on

[15:21:01 - 15:21:05]
yeah I want the chat first and oh sorry

[15:21:03 - 15:21:07]
the image first and the chat second so

[15:21:05 - 15:21:09]
let's try to stop that again and I'm

[15:21:07 - 15:21:11]
going to reopen it this time what I'm

[15:21:09 - 15:21:13]
going to do is I'm going to open up

[15:21:11 - 15:21:14]
inspector and I'm going to make sure

[15:21:13 - 15:21:16]
that it's not cashed so we go to network

[15:21:14 - 15:21:19]
here as long as this is open and that's

[15:21:16 - 15:21:22]
disabled cach is on there that might fix

[15:21:19 - 15:21:27]
our issue here we'll give this a hard

[15:21:22 - 15:21:27]
refresh and that might fix our problem

[15:21:29 - 15:21:33]
I don't understand it worked before

[15:21:31 - 15:21:35]
right actually the image is not showing

[15:21:33 - 15:21:37]
up here at all oh you know what are we

[15:21:35 - 15:21:40]
starting up the wrong app maybe that's

[15:21:37 - 15:21:43]
our problem that's what it is okay so

[15:21:40 - 15:21:43]
we'll start this up

[15:21:45 - 15:21:52]
again I would like to know what gradio

[15:21:48 - 15:21:52]
returns maybe gradio has a a GitHub

[15:21:52 - 15:21:57]
repo obviously

[15:21:54 - 15:21:58]
would but like how do we know what's

[15:21:57 - 15:22:01]
being returned and that's what's kind of

[15:21:58 - 15:22:03]
frustrating here as I feel like the doc

[15:22:01 - 15:22:05]
should tell us that let's go into gradio

[15:22:03 - 15:22:08]
as that might be where it is and then in

[15:22:05 - 15:22:08]
here we have

[15:22:08 - 15:22:13]
our components and then in here we have

[15:22:10 - 15:22:16]
the chat interface

[15:22:13 - 15:22:19]
probably over here maybe it's not under

[15:22:16 - 15:22:21]
components yeah it's just

[15:22:19 - 15:22:26]
there and so what I want to know is like

[15:22:21 - 15:22:30]
what does it return so we have chat

[15:22:26 - 15:22:32]
interface okay what do you return

[15:22:30 - 15:22:37]
you must return

[15:22:32 - 15:22:37]
something the chat interface returns

[15:22:37 - 15:22:42]
itself okay so is there like a submit

[15:22:39 - 15:22:42]
button on here if I type in

[15:22:46 - 15:22:51]
submit I mean there's submit function in

[15:22:48 - 15:22:51]
here right so we have submit

[15:22:52 - 15:22:55]
function so maybe the other one could

[15:22:54 - 15:22:57]
have been correct and maybe it could

[15:22:55 - 15:22:59]
have gone off a submit but without

[15:22:57 - 15:23:00]
knowing exactly what it returns and not

[15:22:59 - 15:23:02]
being defined that kind of makes it a

[15:23:00 - 15:23:03]
little bit hard otherwise you have to

[15:23:02 - 15:23:05]
kind of dig through the code to figure

[15:23:03 - 15:23:07]
it out so anyway we have our chat here

[15:23:05 - 15:23:09]
and um I don't expect it to work with

[15:23:07 - 15:23:11]
Dolly but if it does that would be

[15:23:09 - 15:23:15]
really great so

[15:23:11 - 15:23:17]
um can you tell me what the weather or

[15:23:15 - 15:23:20]
uh uh

[15:23:17 - 15:23:23]
describe a

[15:23:20 - 15:23:23]
nice

[15:23:25 - 15:23:33]
scenic view in a single short

[15:23:31 - 15:23:35]
sentence because what I want to see

[15:23:33 - 15:23:38]
we'll hit enter here is I want to see if

[15:23:35 - 15:23:39]
it uh calls the other one Dolly like we

[15:23:38 - 15:23:42]
didn't write any that code but if it

[15:23:39 - 15:23:42]
works that'd be really

[15:23:43 - 15:23:47]
interesting now while that is going we

[15:23:45 - 15:23:50]
can go check our back end let's see if

[15:23:47 - 15:23:52]
we have any errors I don't see any

[15:23:50 - 15:23:53]
errors here so I'm assuming that it

[15:23:52 - 15:23:56]
might be

[15:23:53 - 15:23:57]
working we have a golden sunsize

[15:23:56 - 15:24:00]
Cascades over the gentle Hills painting

[15:23:57 - 15:24:02]
the sky vibrant Hues of orange and pink

[15:24:00 - 15:24:04]
tranquil Lake mirrors with breath taking

[15:24:02 - 15:24:06]
Beauty that's really awesome that worked

[15:24:04 - 15:24:09]
perfectly um again I would prefer if

[15:24:06 - 15:24:11]
this used the chat interface but

[15:24:09 - 15:24:12]
probably um if we spend a bit more time

[15:24:11 - 15:24:14]
we could figure it out let's go take a

[15:24:12 - 15:24:16]
look at this code just make sure we

[15:24:14 - 15:24:18]
understand it before we move on here but

[15:24:16 - 15:24:21]
I would call gradio done at this point

[15:24:18 - 15:24:23]
so here where we have open API or open

[15:24:21 - 15:24:25]
AI we'll split the screen here so we can

[15:24:23 - 15:24:27]
keep track of where we are then we have

[15:24:25 - 15:24:30]
this generate image prompt right so the

[15:24:27 - 15:24:31]
idea is that for bringing in text and

[15:24:30 - 15:24:33]
then we're calling client image generate

[15:24:31 - 15:24:35]
we're using Dolly 3 we're telling it

[15:24:33 - 15:24:38]
what size of image we want the quality

[15:24:35 - 15:24:41]
of image we want and then we once it

[15:24:38 - 15:24:43]
generates out it it returns that URL

[15:24:41 - 15:24:46]
right then here we have another function

[15:24:43 - 15:24:50]
for chat and generate so we have user

[15:24:46 - 15:24:52]
input and history okay so the idea is

[15:24:50 - 15:24:54]
that we have our messages we will

[15:24:52 - 15:24:56]
iterate through our messages or not

[15:24:54 - 15:24:57]
iterate through it yeah actually we are

[15:24:56 - 15:24:59]
iterating through it but we're appending

[15:24:57 - 15:25:02]
our messages because they're stored in a

[15:24:59 - 15:25:04]
in a a plain array and we're attaching

[15:25:02 - 15:25:06]
as user assistant alternating right so

[15:25:04 - 15:25:09]
we're going user message whatever and

[15:25:06 - 15:25:09]
then we append this message

[15:25:09 - 15:25:14]
here yeah so it seems like what it is is

[15:25:12 - 15:25:16]
that there is like a series of messages

[15:25:14 - 15:25:17]
and one's assistant and then one is user

[15:25:16 - 15:25:20]
that's what it's saying so it's like a

[15:25:17 - 15:25:22]
bunch of those

[15:25:20 - 15:25:24]
okay do we have to destroy that

[15:25:22 - 15:25:26]
structure uh I don't know I mean we do

[15:25:24 - 15:25:28]
for chat GPT we have to do this but

[15:25:26 - 15:25:31]
maybe messages this is the format that

[15:25:28 - 15:25:32]
the actual gradio takes okay then down

[15:25:31 - 15:25:34]
below here we have the response and we

[15:25:32 - 15:25:37]
have a stream and so we are sending the

[15:25:34 - 15:25:40]
streams uh in part

[15:25:37 - 15:25:42]
here okay and so we return to here so I

[15:25:40 - 15:25:45]
would

[15:25:42 - 15:25:47]
think it doesn't seem like it actually

[15:25:45 - 15:25:48]
streams it e because it looks like it's

[15:25:47 - 15:25:50]
taking the stream it's iterating through

[15:25:48 - 15:25:52]
it and it's it's sending it over let me

[15:25:50 - 15:25:55]
go back over here let's observe that

[15:25:52 - 15:26:03]
again did it actually stream okay how

[15:25:55 - 15:26:03]
about a uh uh a like a Sci-Fi a Sci-Fi

[15:26:03 - 15:26:10]
setting okay so hit

[15:26:07 - 15:26:13]
enter yeah it's not readying out it's

[15:26:10 - 15:26:15]
not streaming it okay so it's kind of

[15:26:13 - 15:26:17]
useless the fact that we're using the

[15:26:15 - 15:26:18]
streaming API here because it's not

[15:26:17 - 15:26:20]
doing the typ of writing thing what it's

[15:26:18 - 15:26:22]
doing is taking the response it's

[15:26:20 - 15:26:24]
collecting and doing that so let's say

[15:26:22 - 15:26:28]
gradio streaming

[15:26:24 - 15:26:28]
API streaming outputs

[15:26:29 - 15:26:33]
yeah well that yeah that's what I would

[15:26:31 - 15:26:37]
like to

[15:26:33 - 15:26:39]
do so here it says to

[15:26:37 - 15:26:41]
yield okay so there is a way to to

[15:26:39 - 15:26:43]
change this to be streaming and so we

[15:26:41 - 15:26:46]
have this new one the only thing I would

[15:26:43 - 15:26:46]
like to do is change this code so it's

[15:26:47 - 15:26:51]
streaming

[15:26:49 - 15:26:53]
so that's

[15:26:51 - 15:26:55]
fine so then we have our block we have

[15:26:53 - 15:26:58]
our row we have our image output we have

[15:26:55 - 15:27:00]
our chat bot from the chatbot component

[15:26:58 - 15:27:02]
so as opposed to actually using the chat

[15:27:00 - 15:27:04]
interface we are creating a chatbot

[15:27:02 - 15:27:06]
component and then we have a text field

[15:27:04 - 15:27:08]
so they're completely separate and then

[15:27:06 - 15:27:10]
we have a clear button which we could

[15:27:08 - 15:27:11]
get rid of I don't even think we really

[15:27:10 - 15:27:13]
need a clear button I'm just going to

[15:27:11 - 15:27:14]
get rid of that I don't really want it

[15:27:13 - 15:27:16]
I'll leave it in just because I don't

[15:27:14 - 15:27:18]
want to change the code too

[15:27:16 - 15:27:19]
much no I'm going to get rid of it I

[15:27:18 - 15:27:21]
don't even want to clear button oh you

[15:27:19 - 15:27:25]
know we can just comment it out there we

[15:27:21 - 15:27:28]
go so we have that and so the message is

[15:27:25 - 15:27:30]
when it's submitted

[15:27:28 - 15:27:33]
it has

[15:27:30 - 15:27:37]
respond and so it looks like it does

[15:27:33 - 15:27:38]
chat image chat and generate image so

[15:27:37 - 15:27:42]
Returns the

[15:27:38 - 15:27:42]
imageurl appends to the

[15:27:44 - 15:27:49]
history chat and generate yeah okay so

[15:27:47 - 15:27:52]
generate the chat and then we get the

[15:27:49 - 15:27:56]
image ra back where does this get

[15:27:52 - 15:27:57]
called oh here okay so after the

[15:27:56 - 15:27:59]
response it does it there you know what

[15:27:57 - 15:28:01]
I I don't think we could change this to

[15:27:59 - 15:28:03]
streaming because we would have to wait

[15:28:01 - 15:28:04]
till the final response came well

[15:28:03 - 15:28:07]
actually you know what we could probably

[15:28:04 - 15:28:09]
change it if it if it if it finished and

[15:28:07 - 15:28:11]
then put it in here but I'm not

[15:28:09 - 15:28:14]
confident that uh this code would be

[15:28:11 - 15:28:16]
easy to do if it was non-streaming or

[15:28:14 - 15:28:19]
sorry if it was streaming with an image

[15:28:16 - 15:28:21]
so maybe we should leave it this way but

[15:28:19 - 15:28:22]
you know it would be better if if at

[15:28:21 - 15:28:24]
least this one was streaming so let's go

[15:28:22 - 15:28:26]
back over to this

[15:28:24 - 15:28:29]
one I don't know I'm not sure how to do

[15:28:26 - 15:28:32]
it for the chat interface

[15:28:29 - 15:28:34]
oh sorry maybe chat here we

[15:28:32 - 15:28:36]
go because this one said well this one

[15:28:34 - 15:28:38]
does yield

[15:28:36 - 15:28:41]
right and they were saying like if you

[15:28:38 - 15:28:42]
did yield it would stream it so let's go

[15:28:41 - 15:28:45]
back to the other one for a

[15:28:42 - 15:28:47]
second maybe the other one was streaming

[15:28:45 - 15:28:49]
and I just didn't notice let's go back

[15:28:47 - 15:28:49]
to this

[15:28:54 - 15:28:59]
one

[15:28:56 - 15:29:02]
hello run let's see what happens okay

[15:28:59 - 15:29:04]
all right so second example probably

[15:29:02 - 15:29:05]
streaming might be too hard to do there

[15:29:04 - 15:29:07]
might be a way to do it first one does

[15:29:05 - 15:29:09]
stream so that's okay we'll call this

[15:29:07 - 15:29:10]
done um and yeah I'll just go ahead and

[15:29:09 - 15:29:13]
Commit This code I just want to make

[15:29:10 - 15:29:14]
sure that the EnV is not being included

[15:29:13 - 15:29:15]
it is not so I'm going to go ahead and

[15:29:14 - 15:29:19]
just

[15:29:15 - 15:29:21]
add add uh gradio

[15:29:19 - 15:29:23]
example okay and because I want to be

[15:29:21 - 15:29:27]
responsible I'm going to go over to my

[15:29:23 - 15:29:29]
open AI account wherever that is and I'm

[15:29:27 - 15:29:32]
just going to go ahead and get rid of

[15:29:29 - 15:29:34]
the gradio example revoke there we go

[15:29:32 - 15:29:38]
and I'll see you in the next one okay

[15:29:34 - 15:29:40]
[Music]

[15:29:38 - 15:29:41]
ciao hey this is angre brown in this

[15:29:40 - 15:29:44]
video I want to take a look at

[15:29:41 - 15:29:45]
Streamlight or streamlit it depends on

[15:29:44 - 15:29:46]
how you pronounce it I guess it's

[15:29:45 - 15:29:48]
streamlit that's the correct way of

[15:29:46 - 15:29:52]
saying it very similar to

[15:29:48 - 15:29:54]
gradio um in the sense that uh you have

[15:29:52 - 15:29:57]
um Python and you're able to just start

[15:29:54 - 15:30:00]
writing something and get something back

[15:29:57 - 15:30:02]
um I like streamlet more than gradio but

[15:30:00 - 15:30:03]
really just depends on uh your

[15:30:02 - 15:30:05]
preference U but you need to just kind

[15:30:03 - 15:30:07]
of explore it to find out they have a

[15:30:05 - 15:30:10]
lot of different examples and it's

[15:30:07 - 15:30:13]
really good at generating out um code

[15:30:10 - 15:30:15]
examples very easily with uh with any

[15:30:13 - 15:30:16]
place so it's up to you apparently

[15:30:15 - 15:30:18]
there's like a account that you can make

[15:30:16 - 15:30:21]
I'm going to assume that that's so that

[15:30:18 - 15:30:23]
you can deploy it to their Cloud um

[15:30:21 - 15:30:25]
which might be something you might want

[15:30:23 - 15:30:26]
to do apparently it's free so maybe I'm

[15:30:25 - 15:30:27]
going to go ahead and sign up for this I

[15:30:26 - 15:30:29]
didn't even know you could sign up for

[15:30:27 - 15:30:29]
it

[15:30:30 - 15:30:32]
and I'm going to go ahead and just make

[15:30:31 - 15:30:34]
a new account now I'm just kind of

[15:30:32 - 15:30:36]
curious like could you sign up for

[15:30:34 - 15:30:39]
gradio and I didn't do that

[15:30:36 - 15:30:41]
earlier no so maybe gradio is made by

[15:30:39 - 15:30:43]
hugging face that might that actually

[15:30:41 - 15:30:46]
might make sense who makes

[15:30:43 - 15:30:49]
gradio hugging face okay so that that's

[15:30:46 - 15:30:51]
why there's the hugging face spaces okay

[15:30:49 - 15:30:53]
but we never deployed to hugging space

[15:30:51 - 15:30:54]
spaces when we were or or when we were

[15:30:53 - 15:30:56]
doing gradio but I imagine it's a very

[15:30:54 - 15:30:58]
similar setup so I'm just going to go

[15:30:56 - 15:30:59]
ahead here and just enter in a couple

[15:30:58 - 15:31:00]
things they don't look like they're all

[15:30:59 - 15:31:02]
required so I'm going see if I can just

[15:31:00 - 15:31:03]
skip them here but I got at least enter

[15:31:02 - 15:31:06]
my

[15:31:03 - 15:31:09]
country okay so now we're in here and we

[15:31:06 - 15:31:11]
can go ahead and create an app this way

[15:31:09 - 15:31:13]
no apps to show in this workspace but

[15:31:11 - 15:31:15]
there's obviously other ones here but

[15:31:13 - 15:31:16]
this is not what I'm interested in what

[15:31:15 - 15:31:18]
I'm well that actually that one looked

[15:31:16 - 15:31:21]
really nice

[15:31:18 - 15:31:23]
here like it's it's UI so I would just I

[15:31:21 - 15:31:25]
would just say that streamlet can make

[15:31:23 - 15:31:28]
much nicer looking uis I'm not sure

[15:31:25 - 15:31:31]
what's going on here but um let's go

[15:31:28 - 15:31:33]
ahead and and start using it so I have

[15:31:31 - 15:31:35]
um I actually don't have this open right

[15:31:33 - 15:31:36]
now but in the Gen Essentials I'm going

[15:31:35 - 15:31:39]
to open this up in code spaces again I

[15:31:36 - 15:31:41]
think I already have an existing one so

[15:31:39 - 15:31:43]
if I do I would rather just uh spin that

[15:31:41 - 15:31:46]
one up

[15:31:43 - 15:31:47]
here you'll see that I use all sorts of

[15:31:46 - 15:31:49]
different developer environments I can

[15:31:47 - 15:31:50]
just kind of switch between them so uh

[15:31:49 - 15:31:52]
you know it's just how it is but if we

[15:31:50 - 15:31:53]
go down here I do have one that already

[15:31:52 - 15:31:54]
exists I'm just going to go ahead and

[15:31:53 - 15:31:56]
delete it and we're just going to make a

[15:31:54 - 15:31:57]
new environment in GitHub code spaces

[15:31:56 - 15:31:59]
sometimes use git pod sometimes use

[15:31:57 - 15:32:01]
GitHub code

[15:31:59 - 15:32:03]
spaces sometimes I just use whatever but

[15:32:01 - 15:32:05]
we'll go ahead and open up uh GitHub

[15:32:03 - 15:32:07]
code spaces here the first thing I want

[15:32:05 - 15:32:09]
to do is just change the theme to a dark

[15:32:07 - 15:32:11]
mode once it loads a little bit because

[15:32:09 - 15:32:14]
it's having a a little bit of a hard

[15:32:11 - 15:32:14]
time

[15:32:14 - 15:32:20]
here whenever it decides to let me have

[15:32:16 - 15:32:25]
a theme any day now any day now come on

[15:32:20 - 15:32:28]
give me a theme please nope still

[15:32:25 - 15:32:29]
none okay well anyway while that's load

[15:32:28 - 15:32:32]
let's go over to streamlit and see if we

[15:32:29 - 15:32:34]
can make sense of its documentation so

[15:32:32 - 15:32:36]
we'll go over to the docs

[15:32:34 - 15:32:37]
here and installation should be pretty

[15:32:36 - 15:32:39]
straightforward we're just going to do a

[15:32:37 - 15:32:42]
pip install

[15:32:39 - 15:32:44]
streamlet and then they have an example

[15:32:42 - 15:32:46]
of I mean I would assume you'd have to

[15:32:44 - 15:32:49]
make a Hello hello. apppp

[15:32:46 - 15:32:51]
file and so if this is now

[15:32:49 - 15:32:53]
loaded there we go and we'll just change

[15:32:51 - 15:32:55]
this over to dark mode I'm going to

[15:32:53 - 15:32:57]
install Vim don't install Vim unless you

[15:32:55 - 15:32:58]
know Vim Keys which will remap all your

[15:32:57 - 15:33:01]
keys I need it because I'm just so used

[15:32:58 - 15:33:03]
to using Vim now I can't do anything

[15:33:01 - 15:33:04]
without it uh I'll just say allow here

[15:33:03 - 15:33:07]
for the clipboard we're going to make a

[15:33:04 - 15:33:09]
new folder here called

[15:33:07 - 15:33:12]
streamlit okay and let's just see if we

[15:33:09 - 15:33:13]
can get some uh basic stuff down so the

[15:33:12 - 15:33:16]
first thing we're going to need to do is

[15:33:13 - 15:33:18]
install streamlet now this thing here is

[15:33:16 - 15:33:19]
kind of a um it's a bit different

[15:33:18 - 15:33:20]
because it will actually install a

[15:33:19 - 15:33:22]
binary and so when we want to launch our

[15:33:20 - 15:33:24]
apps we won't type in Python but we'll

[15:33:22 - 15:33:25]
type in streamlet and then the name of

[15:33:24 - 15:33:29]
the Python file but I'm going to go

[15:33:25 - 15:33:32]
ahead and make a requirements.txt here

[15:33:29 - 15:33:34]
and I'm going to go Post in or just

[15:33:32 - 15:33:36]
write in streamlet

[15:33:34 - 15:33:38]
here and then we'll CD into the

[15:33:36 - 15:33:40]
streamlet directory down below I'll bump

[15:33:38 - 15:33:41]
up the font here so that we can read it

[15:33:40 - 15:33:44]
and we'll do a pip install hyphen R

[15:33:41 - 15:33:47]
requirements.txt so that should go ahead

[15:33:44 - 15:33:49]
and install it um so that stuff is

[15:33:47 - 15:33:51]
pretty straightforward let's go look at

[15:33:49 - 15:33:53]
some Concepts

[15:33:51 - 15:33:55]
here I mean they're making it really

[15:33:53 - 15:33:59]
complicated for no reason I feel like

[15:33:55 - 15:33:59]
it's really really easy to use

[15:33:59 - 15:34:06]
mm yeah Stream Run

[15:34:01 - 15:34:06]
apps I'm just kind of looking for its

[15:34:08 - 15:34:12]
[Music]

[15:34:10 - 15:34:14]
components okay that's

[15:34:12 - 15:34:16]
great I think the thing is like most of

[15:34:14 - 15:34:19]
the times when I use streamlet I just

[15:34:16 - 15:34:21]
use something like chat GPT or um claw

[15:34:19 - 15:34:23]
to generate out my interface what I'm

[15:34:21 - 15:34:25]
trying to find is the actual components

[15:34:23 - 15:34:28]
that we can

[15:34:25 - 15:34:32]
utilize and so here we have maybe

[15:34:28 - 15:34:35]
something that we can start with

[15:34:32 - 15:34:38]
so let's try just working with elements

[15:34:35 - 15:34:40]
randomly first okay so we have streamlet

[15:34:38 - 15:34:45]
installed and we're going to make a new

[15:34:40 - 15:34:46]
one called hello hello. uh pi and the

[15:34:45 - 15:34:49]
first thing we'll have to do is import

[15:34:46 - 15:34:50]
streamlet I imagine so

[15:34:49 - 15:34:53]
streamlet

[15:34:50 - 15:34:55]
um just like gradio I bet you could

[15:34:53 - 15:34:57]
probably rename it so we go over here

[15:34:55 - 15:34:58]
maybe like as yeah there we go we'll do

[15:34:57 - 15:35:04]
that we'll do

[15:34:58 - 15:35:04]
as uh like was it SC what do they use as

[15:35:04 - 15:35:08]
abbreviation or do we just import it and

[15:35:06 - 15:35:10]
we can use it they have St so I'm going

[15:35:08 - 15:35:12]
assume that this is what we're supposed

[15:35:10 - 15:35:13]
to do at the top and we'll go here and

[15:35:12 - 15:35:17]
we'll just try the first thing which is

[15:35:13 - 15:35:17]
St right and we'll just say hello

[15:35:18 - 15:35:23]
world and we'll go down below here and

[15:35:21 - 15:35:28]
we'll type in

[15:35:23 - 15:35:29]
streamlet run uh hello.py okay so I

[15:35:28 - 15:35:31]
think that will just work it's going to

[15:35:29 - 15:35:33]
start on this port

[15:35:31 - 15:35:35]
8501 and so we'll open that up here

[15:35:33 - 15:35:38]
we'll give it a

[15:35:35 - 15:35:39]
moment okay and we have some text there

[15:35:38 - 15:35:42]
we go so we can probably write more

[15:35:39 - 15:35:42]
texts and

[15:35:42 - 15:35:45]
Say Goodbye

[15:35:46 - 15:35:50]
Moon okay I've I've done a a save I'm

[15:35:49 - 15:35:53]
hoping that it just

[15:35:50 - 15:35:55]
changes there so that was one nice thing

[15:35:53 - 15:35:57]
that um streamlight's doing that we

[15:35:55 - 15:36:00]
weren't getting gradio maybe gradio had

[15:35:57 - 15:36:01]
a flag for development but streamlet I

[15:36:00 - 15:36:04]
just refreshed and I got it so we have

[15:36:01 - 15:36:06]
two there let's go back over and see

[15:36:04 - 15:36:09]
what else we can do text

[15:36:06 - 15:36:11]
wise so WR uh write generators or

[15:36:09 - 15:36:13]
streams the app in a text writer effect

[15:36:11 - 15:36:15]
oh that looks kind of fun so let's try

[15:36:13 - 15:36:15]
that

[15:36:18 - 15:36:23]
out where are you

[15:36:21 - 15:36:28]
Mars okay so we'll try

[15:36:23 - 15:36:28]
this we a nice refresh

[15:36:28 - 15:36:32]
uh expect a generator or stream like

[15:36:30 - 15:36:35]
object as input okay so we can't

[15:36:32 - 15:36:37]
just we can't just dump it in there like

[15:36:35 - 15:36:39]
that I think like yeah it's expecting a

[15:36:37 - 15:36:41]
a very specific type of object so that's

[15:36:39 - 15:36:43]
interesting anytime streamlet sees

[15:36:41 - 15:36:44]
either a variable or literal value on

[15:36:43 - 15:36:48]
its own line it automatically writes

[15:36:44 - 15:36:51]
that into your app okay

[15:36:48 - 15:36:52]
so um all right let's just give that a

[15:36:51 - 15:36:54]
try then really quickly here so I'm

[15:36:52 - 15:36:57]
going to go back so this is obviously

[15:36:54 - 15:36:59]
not going to work uh we need a streaming

[15:36:57 - 15:37:02]
object

[15:36:59 - 15:37:03]
for this to work let's go here we'll try

[15:37:02 - 15:37:08]
s St

[15:37:03 - 15:37:12]
right hello and we'll do double

[15:37:08 - 15:37:15]
name again I'm just guessing here hello

[15:37:12 - 15:37:18]
Andrew and let's see if that

[15:37:15 - 15:37:19]
works uh yeah that's the old Air I'm

[15:37:18 - 15:37:21]
just going to stop this because it aired

[15:37:19 - 15:37:23]
up before so I just want to see if that

[15:37:21 - 15:37:28]
works through that does that

[15:37:23 - 15:37:28]
work oh cool no no that didn't work

[15:37:29 - 15:37:32]
let's go back over to

[15:37:36 - 15:37:41]
this anytime streen light either a

[15:37:38 - 15:37:43]
variable or literal value uh on its own

[15:37:41 - 15:37:45]
line it automatically writes that to

[15:37:43 - 15:37:45]
your

[15:37:45 - 15:37:51]
app okay uh well maybe maybe it's saying

[15:37:49 - 15:37:53]
something else there and I don't fully

[15:37:51 - 15:37:54]
understand it but that's fine um but we

[15:37:53 - 15:37:55]
can just keep going through here and see

[15:37:54 - 15:37:58]
what we have so that was the first one

[15:37:55 - 15:38:00]
we did magic so magic commands are a

[15:37:58 - 15:38:01]
feature in streamlet that allows you to

[15:38:00 - 15:38:03]
write almost anything in markdown

[15:38:01 - 15:38:05]
without having to to have an explicit

[15:38:03 - 15:38:08]
command

[15:38:05 - 15:38:10]
oh okay it's markup I thought it was

[15:38:08 - 15:38:12]
like some weird injection here okay so

[15:38:10 - 15:38:14]
basically what we're say what we're

[15:38:12 - 15:38:17]
seeing here is if we do

[15:38:14 - 15:38:18]
this right if we if we did a multi-line

[15:38:17 - 15:38:22]
I believe this how we do multi-line in

[15:38:18 - 15:38:24]
in Python then we could say like

[15:38:22 - 15:38:28]
um uh

[15:38:24 - 15:38:30]
hello this is

[15:38:28 - 15:38:33]
magic or matting okay so let's see if

[15:38:30 - 15:38:35]
that works we'll go back over to here

[15:38:33 - 15:38:37]
give us a hard

[15:38:35 - 15:38:41]
refresh okay all right so then it

[15:38:37 - 15:38:45]
automatically knows to format it um okay

[15:38:41 - 15:38:46]
so magic commands like that so here

[15:38:45 - 15:38:47]
maybe it can take other formats because

[15:38:46 - 15:38:49]
here it's suggesting something else so

[15:38:47 - 15:38:53]
this is a document this is some

[15:38:49 - 15:38:56]
markdown draw the string on

[15:38:53 - 15:38:58]
x mark down data and charts without

[15:38:56 - 15:39:00]
having to explicit

[15:38:58 - 15:39:02]
understand the commands so we don't have

[15:39:00 - 15:39:05]
pandas but we could go quickly install

[15:39:02 - 15:39:08]
it as an example so we'll go over to

[15:39:05 - 15:39:09]
here and we'll install pandas pip

[15:39:08 - 15:39:12]
install hyphen R

[15:39:09 - 15:39:12]
requirements.txt

[15:39:17 - 15:39:21]
and required are satisfied okay maybe we

[15:39:20 - 15:39:23]
already have

[15:39:21 - 15:39:25]
pandas so I'm just going to ignore that

[15:39:23 - 15:39:26]
it seemed really upset when I've

[15:39:25 - 15:39:28]
included pandas like that so maybe

[15:39:26 - 15:39:32]
streamless brought it already in and so

[15:39:28 - 15:39:32]
we'll go ahead and just copy this

[15:39:32 - 15:39:37]
here uh draw this data frame well we got

[15:39:34 - 15:39:37]
to write to it I

[15:39:40 - 15:39:45]
think oh is this just going to work

[15:39:42 - 15:39:48]
plainly in here no no that can't be

[15:39:45 - 15:39:48]
right you'd have to do streamlit

[15:39:49 - 15:39:53]
right yeah see I I didn't think it was

[15:39:51 - 15:39:56]
just going to work like that so let's do

[15:39:53 - 15:39:58]
this we'll do St right I'm not sure why

[15:39:56 - 15:39:59]
the examples are incomplete like that

[15:39:58 - 15:40:00]
this is what I don't like about the

[15:39:59 - 15:40:03]
python Community their documentation is

[15:40:00 - 15:40:05]
always um incomplete but here we can

[15:40:03 - 15:40:07]
it's rendering that out so clearly it

[15:40:05 - 15:40:11]
can take a few different types of types

[15:40:07 - 15:40:14]
here draw the string X on the value

[15:40:11 - 15:40:16]
y okay I'm not exactly sure about that

[15:40:14 - 15:40:17]
we have map plot lib as well so we'll

[15:40:16 - 15:40:23]
grab this one as

[15:40:17 - 15:40:25]
well and we'll try this St

[15:40:23 - 15:40:27]
right

[15:40:25 - 15:40:30]
okay give this a hard refresh I'm going

[15:40:27 - 15:40:30]
to assume it's already

[15:40:30 - 15:40:34]
included oh there it is okay great so

[15:40:33 - 15:40:35]
yeah we're starting to get some charting

[15:40:34 - 15:40:39]
that's pretty

[15:40:35 - 15:40:42]
cool let's go back over to um the docs

[15:40:39 - 15:40:43]
here and continue on so we have right

[15:40:42 - 15:40:45]
now we have text

[15:40:43 - 15:40:47]
elements we saw a little bit of that but

[15:40:45 - 15:40:50]
we have like headings and bodies and

[15:40:47 - 15:40:52]
text so if we explicitly want to have

[15:40:50 - 15:40:53]
markdown we do do markdown so that might

[15:40:52 - 15:40:55]
make a little bit more sense for what

[15:40:53 - 15:40:56]
we're doing so clearly that did that but

[15:40:55 - 15:40:58]
we would probably do markdown here like

[15:40:56 - 15:40:59]
this

[15:40:58 - 15:41:01]
right that wouldn't change anything it

[15:40:59 - 15:41:03]
just it would explicitly know that we're

[15:41:01 - 15:41:05]
expecting markdown and not something

[15:41:03 - 15:41:07]
else um I'm going close some of these

[15:41:05 - 15:41:09]
other tabs so I sto opening them up and

[15:41:07 - 15:41:12]
we just kind of stay a bit focused

[15:41:09 - 15:41:13]
here so that's interesting we have a

[15:41:12 - 15:41:15]
title I think that would show up at the

[15:41:13 - 15:41:17]
top here so we can go to the top and

[15:41:15 - 15:41:17]
just say St

[15:41:21 - 15:41:28]
title hello here we'll give this a

[15:41:25 - 15:41:29]
refresh so now we have this at the top

[15:41:28 - 15:41:31]
it seems like we could have different

[15:41:29 - 15:41:34]
levels of titles

[15:41:31 - 15:41:34]
maybe can

[15:41:35 - 15:41:39]
we kind of I mean looks like we can also

[15:41:37 - 15:41:40]
put little other other nice little

[15:41:39 - 15:41:41]
things in here as well looks like it

[15:41:40 - 15:41:44]
even supports

[15:41:41 - 15:41:46]
um uh these I might want to bring those

[15:41:44 - 15:41:48]
in for

[15:41:46 - 15:41:50]
fun that might be like their extension

[15:41:48 - 15:41:53]
of markdown by including that that stuff

[15:41:50 - 15:41:57]
there we go it didn't color it blue

[15:41:53 - 15:42:00]
though I missed the colon that's why so

[15:41:57 - 15:42:00]
go here give this a

[15:42:00 - 15:42:05]
refresh okay cool that's cool I was

[15:42:04 - 15:42:07]
thinking maybe like you could say I'm

[15:42:05 - 15:42:08]
this level of title but I guess it's

[15:42:07 - 15:42:11]
just a single type of

[15:42:08 - 15:42:13]
title oh we have titles and then we have

[15:42:11 - 15:42:16]
headers so I imagine headers probably

[15:42:13 - 15:42:16]
act as the different levels of

[15:42:17 - 15:42:22]
headers um okay well let's just put one

[15:42:19 - 15:42:22]
in

[15:42:23 - 15:42:26]
here I'll go here and drop it in here

[15:42:25 - 15:42:28]
instead refresh that let's see what that

[15:42:26 - 15:42:30]
head looks

[15:42:28 - 15:42:33]
like well that's nice I like

[15:42:30 - 15:42:33]
that and so we want the divider we put

[15:42:33 - 15:42:35]
that on there and then we have a

[15:42:33 - 15:42:38]
subheader okay so it's not like we can

[15:42:35 - 15:42:40]
do H1 H2 H3 it's just like we specify

[15:42:38 - 15:42:43]
what it is that we want um I'm going to

[15:42:40 - 15:42:45]
grab this one which has a gray

[15:42:43 - 15:42:48]
one and I'm going to put

[15:42:45 - 15:42:51]
this between this one

[15:42:48 - 15:42:53]
here and let's take a look at that

[15:42:51 - 15:42:54]
subtitle and so it has nice A little

[15:42:53 - 15:42:58]
Gray Line because that's what we set as

[15:42:54 - 15:43:00]
that there divider Gray

[15:42:58 - 15:43:01]
okay and we already did markdown so we

[15:43:00 - 15:43:04]
saw that already we have a few other

[15:43:01 - 15:43:05]
ones caption code divider Echo latex

[15:43:04 - 15:43:06]
text I think that's pretty

[15:43:05 - 15:43:08]
straightforward code's probably a useful

[15:43:06 - 15:43:11]
one we want to show a code example I'll

[15:43:08 - 15:43:14]
go grab this one really

[15:43:11 - 15:43:15]
quick we'll drop that in there code and

[15:43:14 - 15:43:17]
we specified the

[15:43:15 - 15:43:20]
language I wonder if it supports my

[15:43:17 - 15:43:21]
favorite language Ruby that'd be nice

[15:43:20 - 15:43:24]
but we have our code

[15:43:21 - 15:43:26]
example um so that's fine we can also

[15:43:24 - 15:43:27]
even do HTML which seems pretty cool so

[15:43:26 - 15:43:29]
we see their text elements we have data

[15:43:27 - 15:43:32]
elements so clearly it can render data

[15:43:29 - 15:43:33]
frames now we saw WR implicitly do that

[15:43:32 - 15:43:36]
but if we wanted to render a data frame

[15:43:33 - 15:43:37]
in particular we could do that obviously

[15:43:36 - 15:43:40]
we have

[15:43:37 - 15:43:42]
tables um like there what's metrics we

[15:43:40 - 15:43:46]
have an example here let's see

[15:43:42 - 15:43:46]
it that's really

[15:43:46 - 15:43:52]
cool I guess it's like a metric in the

[15:43:49 - 15:43:54]
sense that it's like a like a dashboard

[15:43:52 - 15:43:55]
right like they're showing temperature

[15:43:54 - 15:43:57]
but I guess you could like have a series

[15:43:55 - 15:43:58]
of metrics so if you wanted to build I

[15:43:57 - 15:44:00]
guess a custom dashboard you could do

[15:43:58 - 15:44:03]
that

[15:44:00 - 15:44:08]
okay Json I assume it just formats the

[15:44:03 - 15:44:11]
Json okay that's nice we have chart

[15:44:08 - 15:44:11]
elements input

[15:44:11 - 15:44:16]
elements so everything's very very

[15:44:14 - 15:44:17]
straightforward clearly clearly

[15:44:16 - 15:44:20]
extremely robust

[15:44:17 - 15:44:22]
system I could see myself like doing

[15:44:20 - 15:44:24]
like a full course on this but right now

[15:44:22 - 15:44:26]
we just want to start utilizing this in

[15:44:24 - 15:44:27]
some practical way so I'm going to go

[15:44:26 - 15:44:29]
ahead and we're going to make a new fun

[15:44:27 - 15:44:31]
we're going to call chat. py and so what

[15:44:29 - 15:44:32]
I want to do is I'm going to use Claud

[15:44:31 - 15:44:36]
because it'll probably do a better job

[15:44:32 - 15:44:39]
of this and I'm going to tell it to use

[15:44:36 - 15:44:46]
um I'm going to say I want to use

[15:44:39 - 15:44:49]
streamlit um to make an app where one

[15:44:46 - 15:44:54]
column has an image

[15:44:49 - 15:44:58]
and the other column is a

[15:44:54 - 15:45:01]
chat uh interface

[15:44:58 - 15:45:04]
the uh we want to

[15:45:01 - 15:45:06]
use open

[15:45:04 - 15:45:09]
AI

[15:45:06 - 15:45:13]
um such as chat

[15:45:09 - 15:45:13]
GPT 40

[15:45:13 - 15:45:19]
mini 40 mini um and

[15:45:20 - 15:45:27]
dolly3 and uh so the response from the

[15:45:25 - 15:45:29]
assistant should generate

[15:45:27 - 15:45:31]
an

[15:45:29 - 15:45:33]
image in the image column okay so

[15:45:31 - 15:45:35]
hopefully that wasn't the worst ridden

[15:45:33 - 15:45:36]
thing but let's see if we can get that

[15:45:35 - 15:45:38]
we already have something similar for

[15:45:36 - 15:45:41]
our gradio example so I found that

[15:45:38 - 15:45:42]
streamlet generates a lot better than

[15:45:41 - 15:45:44]
most

[15:45:42 - 15:45:46]
others and so I have a strong feeling

[15:45:44 - 15:45:48]
that this is going to work first time

[15:45:46 - 15:45:50]
let's hope that it does I have maybe too

[15:45:48 - 15:45:52]
too much faith in in streamlet but

[15:45:50 - 15:45:55]
streamlet is really really well

[15:45:52 - 15:45:58]
optimized uh for for these things and it

[15:45:55 - 15:46:00]
also is just like more robust than

[15:45:58 - 15:46:02]
radio radio is nice too it's just uh

[15:46:00 - 15:46:03]
whatever you want to use I guess so

[15:46:02 - 15:46:05]
we'll go ahead and copy this bigger

[15:46:03 - 15:46:07]
example here and we'll go ahead and

[15:46:05 - 15:46:09]
paste it in but you could see like if

[15:46:07 - 15:46:12]
you wanted to build some kind of very uh

[15:46:09 - 15:46:14]
very nice system that you know you just

[15:46:12 - 15:46:16]
have to spend more time learning uh the

[15:46:14 - 15:46:17]
UI and probably manually configuring it

[15:46:16 - 15:46:18]
I would probably manually configure it

[15:46:17 - 15:46:20]
but right now we're just trying to get

[15:46:18 - 15:46:23]
this in as quick quick and easy as we

[15:46:20 - 15:46:24]
can I already have an env. examples over

[15:46:23 - 15:46:29]
here so I'm going to go ahead and bring

[15:46:24 - 15:46:29]
that over here we're going to Dov EnV

[15:46:31 - 15:46:37]
examples

[15:46:33 - 15:46:38]
andv um yeah I decided to use open AI we

[15:46:37 - 15:46:41]
could have used anything but it's just

[15:46:38 - 15:46:44]
really easy to use open a open API so

[15:46:41 - 15:46:47]
I'm just going to do that today open AI

[15:46:44 - 15:46:49]
um and I do need python dodev so I'll

[15:46:47 - 15:46:51]
bring that over here and we'll bring

[15:46:49 - 15:46:54]
that in and just stop this I'm going to

[15:46:51 - 15:46:55]
do a pyth or pip install pyr

[15:46:54 - 15:46:57]
requirements.txt we might need more

[15:46:55 - 15:46:59]
requirements depending on what we need

[15:46:57 - 15:47:01]
to do here but that should be good

[15:46:59 - 15:47:03]
enough for now I do have the open API

[15:47:01 - 15:47:04]
over or open AI here so you have to

[15:47:03 - 15:47:05]
figure way there if you don't know how

[15:47:04 - 15:47:08]
to get there I show you how to do that

[15:47:05 - 15:47:09]
in the gradio lab so maybe do that one

[15:47:08 - 15:47:11]
first if these are out of order this is

[15:47:09 - 15:47:14]
going to be streamlit as our example

[15:47:11 - 15:47:16]
here um in this we have to set more than

[15:47:14 - 15:47:18]
just um that I created a new project for

[15:47:16 - 15:47:20]
radio so I'm going to go ahead here and

[15:47:18 - 15:47:22]
just make a new project called streamlet

[15:47:20 - 15:47:24]
I'm not sure how many projects I can

[15:47:22 - 15:47:25]
have but I'll just make another one and

[15:47:24 - 15:47:28]
I'll just create the key now we'll just

[15:47:25 - 15:47:28]
call this stream

[15:47:28 - 15:47:32]
and this will be set to the streamlet

[15:47:30 - 15:47:34]
project we'll create that I'm going to

[15:47:32 - 15:47:36]
copy that key we're going to go back

[15:47:34 - 15:47:38]
over

[15:47:36 - 15:47:42]
Tov I'm going to paste it in here for

[15:47:38 - 15:47:44]
now um I need this as the key to get

[15:47:42 - 15:47:46]
loaded we'll go over here I'll wrap that

[15:47:44 - 15:47:48]
in parenthesis I want to make sure I

[15:47:46 - 15:47:52]
bring in my dog ignore file I don't want

[15:47:48 - 15:47:55]
to commit the EnV here so just Dov so

[15:47:52 - 15:47:58]
that's not a problem um I do need to set

[15:47:55 - 15:48:00]
the other two the project ID and the or

[15:47:58 - 15:48:02]
ID so let me just grab these two here

[15:48:00 - 15:48:04]
and I'm going to go back over to the EnV

[15:48:02 - 15:48:07]
we'll go down I'm going to go back over

[15:48:04 - 15:48:09]
to the API over here I need to go to the

[15:48:07 - 15:48:12]
actual projects we'll manage the

[15:48:09 - 15:48:14]
projects and in here we should have this

[15:48:12 - 15:48:15]
loads here for a moment the reason I'm

[15:48:14 - 15:48:17]
using o Open AI is because they do have

[15:48:15 - 15:48:20]
a free tier at least right now I'm not

[15:48:17 - 15:48:22]
sure about like um uh Claude they might

[15:48:20 - 15:48:25]
not have a free tier so that's why I'm

[15:48:22 - 15:48:27]
not using it right now even though CLA

[15:48:25 - 15:48:28]
is really really good but uh I'm going

[15:48:27 - 15:48:30]
to go over here to organizations going

[15:48:28 - 15:48:32]
to grab this organization ID I'm going

[15:48:30 - 15:48:35]
to go back over to here we'll drop in

[15:48:32 - 15:48:37]
the orc ID and now we are fully

[15:48:35 - 15:48:38]
configured for this that doesn't mean

[15:48:37 - 15:48:40]
this is going to work but let's go take

[15:48:38 - 15:48:41]
a look because there are other other

[15:48:40 - 15:48:43]
things here I'm not sure if it will

[15:48:41 - 15:48:44]
require it but I don't think so the only

[15:48:43 - 15:48:47]
thing we'd have to add into our

[15:48:44 - 15:48:49]
requirements.txt here is open AI so I'm

[15:48:47 - 15:48:51]
going to go do that right now and we'll

[15:48:49 - 15:48:54]
go ahead and we'll just say python app

[15:48:51 - 15:48:56]
or I'm sorry pip install iyr

[15:48:54 - 15:48:58]
requirements.txt and we're going to go

[15:48:56 - 15:49:02]
ahead and install

[15:48:58 - 15:49:04]
that okay so that's now installed um

[15:49:02 - 15:49:06]
let's just run it let's see what it

[15:49:04 - 15:49:09]
works and then we'll go look at the

[15:49:06 - 15:49:13]
code so we'll say this is streamlit

[15:49:09 - 15:49:15]
streamlit Run chat.

[15:49:13 - 15:49:16]
py Okay started up no problem we'll go

[15:49:15 - 15:49:18]
back over here because this a hard

[15:49:16 - 15:49:21]
refresh it should be the same URL I

[15:49:18 - 15:49:23]
would think and we'll give it a

[15:49:21 - 15:49:25]
moment and we have an error which is

[15:49:23 - 15:49:28]
fine the code is not exactly right so

[15:49:25 - 15:49:30]
we'll go back over to here here um yeah

[15:49:28 - 15:49:32]
this isn't right so we'll go over to to

[15:49:30 - 15:49:34]
our other gradio example where I know

[15:49:32 - 15:49:36]
that we have this configured correctly

[15:49:34 - 15:49:37]
the client at least they called it

[15:49:36 - 15:49:41]
client that's like the way I like to

[15:49:37 - 15:49:43]
call it but this is uh this is wrong

[15:49:41 - 15:49:47]
okay so that's one thing that's

[15:49:43 - 15:49:51]
[Music]

[15:49:47 - 15:49:54]
wrong I'm not sure about the rest Dolly

[15:49:51 - 15:49:57]
looks fine let's go back and take a look

[15:49:54 - 15:49:57]
here

[15:50:00 - 15:50:05]
um oh we didn't import org or sorry we

[15:50:03 - 15:50:08]
have to actually load our EMV file so

[15:50:05 - 15:50:09]
we'll grab these three lines here I'll

[15:50:08 - 15:50:12]
paste that in there we'll give this a

[15:50:09 - 15:50:15]
nice refresh here

[15:50:12 - 15:50:17]
okay we still have a bit of a problem

[15:50:15 - 15:50:19]
the open API key is being set but it

[15:50:17 - 15:50:20]
didn't load the EnV so we have to uh

[15:50:19 - 15:50:21]
stop it and start it because that only

[15:50:20 - 15:50:24]
gets loaded once it's not going to

[15:50:21 - 15:50:27]
dynamically load

[15:50:24 - 15:50:29]
that no I mean it is set so should stop

[15:50:27 - 15:50:30]
complaining about that let's make sure

[15:50:29 - 15:50:32]
that's in the correct directory we are

[15:50:30 - 15:50:33]
we are in streamlet here I'm going to

[15:50:32 - 15:50:36]
just stop this for a moment let me

[15:50:33 - 15:50:40]
double check this open AI

[15:50:36 - 15:50:41]
key open AI key it definitely is

[15:50:40 - 15:50:44]
set

[15:50:41 - 15:50:47]
here oh the name is wrong okay so that's

[15:50:44 - 15:50:48]
my my mistake here this one's spelled

[15:50:47 - 15:50:52]
wrong maybe the other one's spelled

[15:50:48 - 15:50:53]
wrong too in the old one here uh this

[15:50:52 - 15:50:56]
one

[15:50:53 - 15:50:59]
here there we go and so we'll try try

[15:50:56 - 15:51:02]
this again here we'll give this a

[15:50:59 - 15:51:06]
refresh do we get an interface now there

[15:51:02 - 15:51:10]
we go um so just say like can you uh can

[15:51:06 - 15:51:12]
you describe a uh

[15:51:10 - 15:51:15]
scenic

[15:51:12 - 15:51:17]
view of

[15:51:15 - 15:51:20]
Japan let's see if that works if it

[15:51:17 - 15:51:22]
works first time that'd be really

[15:51:20 - 15:51:24]
great okay it didn't stream it which is

[15:51:22 - 15:51:27]
totally

[15:51:24 - 15:51:30]
fine I don't see any IM generated but

[15:51:27 - 15:51:30]
that doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't

[15:51:31 - 15:51:36]
[Music]

[15:51:33 - 15:51:37]
work yeah we didn't see it

[15:51:36 - 15:51:39]
stream okay so that makes me think it

[15:51:37 - 15:51:41]
didn't

[15:51:39 - 15:51:42]
work let's go back over here for a

[15:51:41 - 15:51:45]
moment because it could take longer for

[15:51:42 - 15:51:47]
it to work and we don't really really

[15:51:45 - 15:51:49]
have like a responsive feedback there it

[15:51:47 - 15:51:50]
would take more time for us to

[15:51:49 - 15:51:53]
investigate streamlet to really figure

[15:51:50 - 15:51:56]
out how to properly configure it for

[15:51:53 - 15:51:57]
better feedback well let's just see I'm

[15:51:56 - 15:51:58]
going to zoom out here so I can read the

[15:51:57 - 15:52:00]
code a little bit easier I'm going to

[15:51:58 - 15:52:03]
close this tab out we don't need to keep

[15:52:00 - 15:52:05]
this uh tab open here close

[15:52:03 - 15:52:07]
all because we do have a lot of code

[15:52:05 - 15:52:10]
here so we have a button clear it clears

[15:52:07 - 15:52:13]
all the stuff which is

[15:52:10 - 15:52:14]
fine column one we have a heading here

[15:52:13 - 15:52:16]
which is

[15:52:14 - 15:52:18]
fine I don't even care about these

[15:52:16 - 15:52:20]
interfaces let's take all this stuff out

[15:52:18 - 15:52:22]
let's just pair this down so this is a

[15:52:20 - 15:52:24]
lot easier for us to look at I'll take

[15:52:22 - 15:52:28]
out this header as

[15:52:24 - 15:52:28]
well yeah so we have our message

[15:52:28 - 15:52:36]
add a CH a message to the

[15:52:31 - 15:52:39]
chat generate response with gp4

[15:52:36 - 15:52:41]
okay so here it should generate it out

[15:52:39 - 15:52:43]
so it should go over to

[15:52:41 - 15:52:45]
Dolly and then the image response should

[15:52:43 - 15:52:48]
go over here and set the

[15:52:45 - 15:52:52]
image and it should

[15:52:48 - 15:52:52]
rerun okay but it never did

[15:52:52 - 15:52:57]
that the image never generated

[15:53:00 - 15:53:03]
okay so here's going to update our code

[15:53:01 - 15:53:03]
with some

[15:53:11 - 15:53:16]
debugging also it's using gp4 I told to

[15:53:14 - 15:53:18]
use GPT 40 mini which is kind of

[15:53:16 - 15:53:20]
annoying that it's not listening to me

[15:53:18 - 15:53:21]
it's I think I think that that model

[15:53:20 - 15:53:24]
doesn't exist

[15:53:21 - 15:53:25]
maybe so I might just go ahead and and

[15:53:24 - 15:53:28]
copy this one I know it brought back in

[15:53:25 - 15:53:31]
the things I just deleted out which is

[15:53:28 - 15:53:32]
fine but I wanted to use gp24 mini

[15:53:31 - 15:53:34]
that's really annoying that it's not

[15:53:32 - 15:53:37]
using the one that I asked it to

[15:53:34 - 15:53:40]
use so we'll go over to here and this

[15:53:37 - 15:53:40]
one uses GPT 40

[15:53:40 - 15:53:46]
mini GPT 40 mini here we go we'll swap

[15:53:43 - 15:53:49]
that out like that there we go um also I

[15:53:46 - 15:53:50]
mean this one doesn't use message.

[15:53:49 - 15:53:52]
contents it

[15:53:50 - 15:53:57]
uses

[15:53:52 - 15:53:59]
Delta choices. Delta

[15:53:57 - 15:53:59]
I

[15:53:59 - 15:54:03]
[Music]

[15:54:01 - 15:54:05]
think hold on let's go to my other one

[15:54:03 - 15:54:09]
here for gradio that we already have

[15:54:05 - 15:54:11]
working this is Dolly 3 I think Dolly 3

[15:54:09 - 15:54:11]
is

[15:54:13 - 15:54:18]
fine GPT for

[15:54:16 - 15:54:20]
mini I think it's going to break it

[15:54:18 - 15:54:23]
because I've changed the code but we try

[15:54:20 - 15:54:23]
this over time

[15:54:28 - 15:54:31]
oh it already has an

[15:54:31 - 15:54:39]
error secrets.

[15:54:35 - 15:54:39]
toml what is it talking about

[15:54:40 - 15:54:44]
secrets I'm not sure why it's asking

[15:54:42 - 15:54:46]
about Secrets let's stop this again

[15:54:44 - 15:54:46]
let's try this

[15:54:47 - 15:54:50]
again give this a nice hard

[15:54:53 - 15:54:58]
refresh valid Paths of secrets. or

[15:54:56 - 15:54:58]
Secrets

[15:54:59 - 15:55:03]
directory um no secrets found okay so

[15:55:02 - 15:55:05]
it's kind of expecting secrets to be in

[15:55:03 - 15:55:07]
here I'm not sure why again I'm not that

[15:55:05 - 15:55:12]
familiar with all the settings for this

[15:55:07 - 15:55:12]
but we'll say secrets toml for

[15:55:13 - 15:55:17]
streamlit so an optional file you can

[15:55:16 - 15:55:19]
use when your working directory when

[15:55:17 - 15:55:21]
secrets of T is defined both globally in

[15:55:19 - 15:55:23]
your directory combined secrets and

[15:55:21 - 15:55:26]
gives presidence oh that's kind of nice

[15:55:23 - 15:55:27]
oh I see so you can set the open API key

[15:55:26 - 15:55:29]
other values that way that's really nice

[15:55:27 - 15:55:31]
and then you can reference them that way

[15:55:29 - 15:55:33]
I mean that's great but we already

[15:55:31 - 15:55:35]
referenced it in another way so I guess

[15:55:33 - 15:55:37]
I'm not really worried about that the

[15:55:35 - 15:55:39]
only thing is like I'm not sure where

[15:55:37 - 15:55:39]
this is the

[15:55:39 - 15:55:44]
secrets here oh

[15:55:42 - 15:55:46]
it's yeah yeah yeah yeah it's being

[15:55:44 - 15:55:48]
stupid so we'll go ahead here we'll copy

[15:55:46 - 15:55:50]
this this we'll fix it this one line

[15:55:48 - 15:55:52]
here but this is still going to break

[15:55:50 - 15:55:54]
because um the way we have it configured

[15:55:52 - 15:55:57]
probably the better way we use the

[15:55:54 - 15:55:59]
secrets but I'm not going to do that

[15:55:57 - 15:56:02]
oh my goodness did we not get rid of the

[15:55:59 - 15:56:05]
stupid Secrets thing

[15:56:02 - 15:56:06]
Secrets no get out of here secrets we

[15:56:05 - 15:56:09]
don't want to use

[15:56:06 - 15:56:11]
that we used a more generic way that's

[15:56:09 - 15:56:11]
better

[15:56:13 - 15:56:19]
okay okay uh yeah yeah this stuff's gone

[15:56:16 - 15:56:24]
okay that's the problem

[15:56:19 - 15:56:24]
here and we got to stop and restart this

[15:56:27 - 15:56:34]
now we could just keep asking

[15:56:30 - 15:56:37]
um what this is more complicated than

[15:56:34 - 15:56:37]
before I don't want all

[15:56:38 - 15:56:46]
this all right that's fine we'll just

[15:56:40 - 15:56:46]
say uh uh describe a tropical

[15:56:48 - 15:56:53]
drink all right that's fine but we don't

[15:56:51 - 15:56:58]
have any image generated

[15:56:53 - 15:56:58]
yet let's go over to here

[15:57:01 - 15:57:08]
we don't see any errors per

[15:57:03 - 15:57:08]
se but it's not generating it out okay

[15:57:09 - 15:57:15]
[Music]

[15:57:11 - 15:57:15]
so now here's the question if I use

[15:57:17 - 15:57:22]
this print hello I want to see if like

[15:57:20 - 15:57:26]
this will print anything if we do that

[15:57:22 - 15:57:26]
so stop this start this again here

[15:57:29 - 15:57:33]
care what I put in here okay so hello

[15:57:31 - 15:57:36]
does appear in here and so maybe this is

[15:57:33 - 15:57:38]
a way that we can debug

[15:57:36 - 15:57:40]
it

[15:57:38 - 15:57:42]
okay but the chat worked even with our

[15:57:40 - 15:57:44]
changes here I think it was stream if

[15:57:42 - 15:57:45]
it's stream it uses Delta du content and

[15:57:44 - 15:57:47]
that's why we had issues when we were

[15:57:45 - 15:57:50]
doing gradio which might be in a

[15:57:47 - 15:57:51]
different video here um what I'm

[15:57:50 - 15:57:55]
wondering is like does it generate an

[15:57:51 - 15:57:58]
image here so here it be like print

[15:57:55 - 15:58:00]
generating image oh look it's actually

[15:57:58 - 15:58:01]
tying it so you have to say these words

[15:58:00 - 15:58:04]
otherwise it's not going to generate it

[15:58:01 - 15:58:06]
out no no no no no no no we said that I

[15:58:04 - 15:58:07]
I want it to happen every single time so

[15:58:06 - 15:58:09]
that's why it's not working maybe okay

[15:58:07 - 15:58:10]
so let's go ahead here and take this set

[15:58:09 - 15:58:12]
like

[15:58:10 - 15:58:14]
this okay and so now we'll go back over

[15:58:12 - 15:58:14]
to

[15:58:15 - 15:58:22]
here describe to me a tropical drink

[15:58:19 - 15:58:24]
just a single single sentence

[15:58:22 - 15:58:26]
description and now let's see what we

[15:58:24 - 15:58:28]
get here

[15:58:26 - 15:58:30]
well it's generating an image but it's

[15:58:28 - 15:58:32]
doing it in line uh which might be part

[15:58:30 - 15:58:35]
of that chat chat interface because this

[15:58:32 - 15:58:38]
chat interface probably can do

[15:58:35 - 15:58:40]
that okay but it did send it over to the

[15:58:38 - 15:58:42]
other spot so okay that's perfect then

[15:58:40 - 15:58:44]
that's fine that was a very different

[15:58:42 - 15:58:45]
kind of experience I wasn't expecting to

[15:58:44 - 15:58:47]
see that kind of interface over there

[15:58:45 - 15:58:48]
but we'd have to read more about that

[15:58:47 - 15:58:51]
component to

[15:58:48 - 15:58:51]
understand

[15:58:52 - 15:58:58]
um but yeah like where is the code yeah

[15:58:55 - 15:58:59]
here's ch chat chat message so the way

[15:58:58 - 15:59:02]
it works here is like we have chat

[15:58:59 - 15:59:05]
message user chat so yeah so we have the

[15:59:02 - 15:59:07]
chat input here then we have chat

[15:59:05 - 15:59:09]
message for the user chat message for

[15:59:07 - 15:59:12]
the assistant it prints it

[15:59:09 - 15:59:14]
out anyway I would just say that gradio

[15:59:12 - 15:59:17]
is easier to understand its components

[15:59:14 - 15:59:19]
but streamlit is a lot more uh robust

[15:59:17 - 15:59:22]
and if you are you were to invest the

[15:59:19 - 15:59:25]
time into it you can basically make a

[15:59:22 - 15:59:27]
lot more complex apps than uh gradio but

[15:59:25 - 15:59:28]
I don't want to go too de here as I feel

[15:59:27 - 15:59:30]
that uh it can get really confusing

[15:59:28 - 15:59:32]
really quickly so we'll just wrap this

[15:59:30 - 15:59:36]
up as we've produced something very

[15:59:32 - 15:59:40]
similar to what we wanted in um that

[15:59:36 - 15:59:41]
there we did uh sign up to uh streamlet

[15:59:40 - 15:59:42]
I don't really care to push to it it

[15:59:41 - 15:59:44]
doesn't really matter to me I guess we

[15:59:42 - 15:59:47]
could push to it we we signed up for it

[15:59:44 - 15:59:49]
so maybe we should do that um and I'll

[15:59:47 - 15:59:52]
just sign in here I'm not exactly sure

[15:59:49 - 15:59:54]
how we push create an

[15:59:52 - 15:59:56]
app okay so it's a repo I'm not going to

[15:59:54 - 15:59:58]
do that so you'd have a GitHub repo

[15:59:56 - 16:00:02]
you'd sync it and then it would go there

[15:59:58 - 16:00:03]
okay that makes sense um so I'll just

[16:00:02 - 16:00:05]
sync these changes

[16:00:03 - 16:00:09]
here okay and I'm just going to do a bit

[16:00:05 - 16:00:12]
of cleanup so I want to go back over to

[16:00:09 - 16:00:14]
um here into uh this and I just want to

[16:00:12 - 16:00:17]
go and delete that

[16:00:14 - 16:00:18]
key okay I have a couple junk projects

[16:00:17 - 16:00:20]
in here so I'm going to manage these

[16:00:18 - 16:00:20]
ones

[16:00:22 - 16:00:26]
here and I'm just going to delete these

[16:00:24 - 16:00:28]
as well

[16:00:26 - 16:00:30]
radio yep we'll archive

[16:00:28 - 16:00:34]
that and we'll archive

[16:00:30 - 16:00:35]
streamlit there we go and I will see you

[16:00:34 - 16:00:38]
in the next one okay

[16:00:35 - 16:00:41]
[Music]

[16:00:38 - 16:00:43]
ciao hey this is Andre Brown let's take

[16:00:41 - 16:00:45]
a look at lovable so lovable is an a

[16:00:43 - 16:00:46]
power assistant and what I like about it

[16:00:45 - 16:00:49]
is that it's really good at building

[16:00:46 - 16:00:51]
things end to end for you um so whereas

[16:00:49 - 16:00:54]
something like let's say a cursor GitHub

[16:00:51 - 16:00:56]
co-pilot is designed to help you as you

[16:00:54 - 16:00:58]
code this thing is more intended to be

[16:00:56 - 16:01:00]
like end to end build your entire

[16:00:58 - 16:01:01]
application for you so we can go in here

[16:01:00 - 16:01:03]
and build something that we want so

[16:01:01 - 16:01:08]
maybe we might want something like uh

[16:01:03 - 16:01:11]
build me uh a clone of Link tree uh for

[16:01:08 - 16:01:13]
developers and um we don't have to

[16:01:11 - 16:01:18]
specify what it uses but generally it

[16:01:13 - 16:01:21]
will use Tailwind C uh Tailwind CSS and

[16:01:18 - 16:01:22]
um typescript and Shad Cen as most of

[16:01:21 - 16:01:24]
these are being optimized here we could

[16:01:22 - 16:01:26]
also attach an image if we had an

[16:01:24 - 16:01:28]
example but it's as simple as writing uh

[16:01:26 - 16:01:31]
uh this amount of

[16:01:28 - 16:01:31]
information

[16:01:31 - 16:01:37]
and clone app of

[16:01:34 - 16:01:39]
this and we'll go ahead and enter and

[16:01:37 - 16:01:41]
from here it's just going to go ahead

[16:01:39 - 16:01:44]
and start building it for

[16:01:41 - 16:01:45]
us and I what I really like is that it

[16:01:44 - 16:01:47]
will do its own Corrections now it can

[16:01:45 - 16:01:49]
hook up to super base I actually haven't

[16:01:47 - 16:01:51]
done much with super base uh in the last

[16:01:49 - 16:01:53]
while here but maybe we could try to see

[16:01:51 - 16:01:55]
if we could hook that up if we can get

[16:01:53 - 16:01:57]
an interface here and right now I'm on

[16:01:55 - 16:01:59]
the free tier there is a pay tier it's

[16:01:57 - 16:02:01]
probably $20 a month but we're going to

[16:01:59 - 16:02:02]
get away with um something very minimal

[16:02:01 - 16:02:04]
here maybe we can try to hook it up to

[16:02:02 - 16:02:06]
super base and do something with that as

[16:02:04 - 16:02:09]
they say that they can do something here

[16:02:06 - 16:02:12]
but as you see it's it's dumping out

[16:02:09 - 16:02:15]
code and what I really like is that it

[16:02:12 - 16:02:17]
shows you uh what it's considering in

[16:02:15 - 16:02:21]
terms of its uh version one and so you

[16:02:17 - 16:02:21]
could I suppose tell it to version

[16:02:22 - 16:02:27]
things and it should give us a live

[16:02:24 - 16:02:29]
preview here

[16:02:27 - 16:02:30]
I'll just pause here and wait till it's

[16:02:29 - 16:02:33]
fully generated it shouldn't take too

[16:02:30 - 16:02:35]
long actually literally waited 10

[16:02:33 - 16:02:38]
seconds and here we have we have our own

[16:02:35 - 16:02:41]
link tree now so this is now implemented

[16:02:38 - 16:02:43]
and something we might want to do is um

[16:02:41 - 16:02:45]
uh publish this or sorry like sync this

[16:02:43 - 16:02:48]
to our GitHub so I'm going to go here

[16:02:45 - 16:02:49]
and I'm going to sync it to my uh Omen

[16:02:48 - 16:02:52]
King account and so make a new repo

[16:02:49 - 16:02:54]
called Cod code connect tree and so now

[16:02:52 - 16:02:55]
we have it here and I can open the code

[16:02:54 - 16:02:57]
Bas and vs code if I want to explore the

[16:02:55 - 16:03:01]
enre code base we can go over to GitHub

[16:02:57 - 16:03:01]
I just hit period to open up

[16:03:16 - 16:03:21]
github.io it's bringing every single

[16:03:18 - 16:03:22]
Shad CN component in if you don't know

[16:03:21 - 16:03:25]
what Shad CN is we'll just take a quick

[16:03:22 - 16:03:27]
look here but Shad CN are these solid

[16:03:25 - 16:03:29]
components that you can just drop into

[16:03:27 - 16:03:32]
your code um they're based off the thing

[16:03:29 - 16:03:34]
I think called shadex um underneath we

[16:03:32 - 16:03:36]
go to code

[16:03:34 - 16:03:37]
here um yeah they are based off of

[16:03:36 - 16:03:38]
shadex it's not saying that here but

[16:03:37 - 16:03:40]
these are all the components it's using

[16:03:38 - 16:03:43]
so the idea is that it will compose

[16:03:40 - 16:03:44]
stuff utilizing that if we go back here

[16:03:43 - 16:03:46]
it's dropping all of them in here

[16:03:44 - 16:03:47]
regardless if we're using them all but

[16:03:46 - 16:03:49]
anyway we come back over to here and so

[16:03:47 - 16:03:51]
we have our interface the next question

[16:03:49 - 16:03:53]
is like okay how would I hook this up to

[16:03:51 - 16:03:55]
super base which I've actually never

[16:03:53 - 16:03:56]
done before so we do have a button here

[16:03:55 - 16:03:58]
and so it says connect to add

[16:03:56 - 16:04:01]
authentication store data and call third

[16:03:58 - 16:04:02]
party apis um so I'm kind of interested

[16:04:01 - 16:04:03]
in seeing what we could do with that

[16:04:02 - 16:04:05]
let's go ahead and connect

[16:04:03 - 16:04:07]
superbase and I don't even think I have

[16:04:05 - 16:04:09]
a superbase account as of recent but

[16:04:07 - 16:04:12]
I'll go ahead and click on continue with

[16:04:09 - 16:04:15]
GitHub I'm going to authorize this here

[16:04:12 - 16:04:18]
if you don't know subase it is a um uh

[16:04:15 - 16:04:21]
opinionated serverless back

[16:04:18 - 16:04:23]
end so just give this a moment here

[16:04:21 - 16:04:24]
we'll just accept whatever it's uh

[16:04:23 - 16:04:26]
saying

[16:04:24 - 16:04:28]
here all right so we'll go ahead and

[16:04:26 - 16:04:32]
scroll down we'll create our

[16:04:28 - 16:04:36]
organization and we'll just say exam

[16:04:32 - 16:04:37]
proo and educational we could say I'll

[16:04:36 - 16:04:39]
stick with the free tier for now we'll

[16:04:37 - 16:04:39]
create the

[16:04:40 - 16:04:44]
organization so I know that we can hook

[16:04:42 - 16:04:46]
this up the question is can it also

[16:04:44 - 16:04:48]
write the code for that as I believe

[16:04:46 - 16:04:51]
that it can so I'm going to go ahead and

[16:04:48 - 16:04:51]
authorize lovable

[16:04:52 - 16:04:57]
here so that means lovable will actually

[16:04:54 - 16:04:57]
be able to set up the back end here

[16:04:57 - 16:05:02]
here okay so now sub base is connected

[16:05:00 - 16:05:05]
and so the next question is like can we

[16:05:02 - 16:05:10]
hook up the back end so uh you know can

[16:05:05 - 16:05:15]
you can you hook up this

[16:05:10 - 16:05:18]
um can you code the back end for this uh

[16:05:15 - 16:05:22]
app to superbase

[16:05:18 - 16:05:26]
please you probably don't have to

[16:05:22 - 16:05:28]
say please but does does hurt so I'm

[16:05:26 - 16:05:29]
just curious if it can do it because

[16:05:28 - 16:05:31]
again this is a beta feature but I'm

[16:05:29 - 16:05:33]
just curious as to how far it can go

[16:05:31 - 16:05:35]
along here click on the super base menu

[16:05:33 - 16:05:36]
in the top right corner connect your

[16:05:35 - 16:05:41]
project to super base once connected I

[16:05:36 - 16:05:41]
can help you um okay so yeah it is

[16:05:45 - 16:05:49]
connected and I'm not sure if we'll run

[16:05:47 - 16:05:50]
on the free tier here uh but we'll see

[16:05:49 - 16:05:52]
the best that we can do here I keeping

[16:05:50 - 16:05:56]
the the scope of the project really

[16:05:52 - 16:05:56]
small to see how far we can get

[16:05:57 - 16:06:00]
and so it looks like what it's doing and

[16:05:59 - 16:06:02]
we probably click here and see what it's

[16:06:00 - 16:06:06]
doing but I believe it's updating the

[16:06:02 - 16:06:06]
existing files to integrate

[16:06:06 - 16:06:09]
superbase okay so I've implemented the

[16:06:08 - 16:06:11]
superbase back in integration with

[16:06:09 - 16:06:12]
GitHub authentication profile management

[16:06:11 - 16:06:14]
Link Storage you'll need to create the

[16:06:12 - 16:06:16]
database tables in superbase dashboard

[16:06:14 - 16:06:18]
and configure the GitHub ooth for

[16:06:16 - 16:06:22]
authentication to work okay so I guess

[16:06:18 - 16:06:25]
the question is how do I do that um so

[16:06:22 - 16:06:26]
let's make our way over to superbase

[16:06:25 - 16:06:28]
super

[16:06:26 - 16:06:31]
base

[16:06:28 - 16:06:33]
here and I'm going to go ahead to the

[16:06:31 - 16:06:34]
dashboard and so we probably have a well

[16:06:33 - 16:06:36]
I thought we would have had a new

[16:06:34 - 16:06:39]
project

[16:06:36 - 16:06:41]
here um so didn't create the project

[16:06:39 - 16:06:42]
let's go over and sync this code back

[16:06:41 - 16:06:44]
over

[16:06:42 - 16:06:46]
[Music]

[16:06:44 - 16:06:49]
to GitHub it might have actually already

[16:06:46 - 16:06:50]
done that so we'll go back over to here

[16:06:49 - 16:06:54]
I'm going to go over here and give this

[16:06:50 - 16:06:54]
a refresh

[16:06:56 - 16:07:01]
um so I'm not sure if it pushed the new

[16:06:59 - 16:07:02]
changes let's go take a look here we do

[16:07:01 - 16:07:04]
have three commits here connect

[16:07:02 - 16:07:06]
component projects and features that

[16:07:04 - 16:07:07]
actually just did happen right now so

[16:07:06 - 16:07:10]
we'll click into

[16:07:07 - 16:07:14]
this and so we have super base

[16:07:10 - 16:07:16]
added it added a super base. TS file so

[16:07:14 - 16:07:20]
we would have to update the project

[16:07:16 - 16:07:24]
URL uh we would have I suppose a key

[16:07:20 - 16:07:26]
here we have UI button uh the toast

[16:07:24 - 16:07:29]
looks like it ripped a bunch of stuff

[16:07:26 - 16:07:30]
here then we

[16:07:29 - 16:07:34]
[Music]

[16:07:30 - 16:07:36]
have more more stuff here okay so this

[16:07:34 - 16:07:38]
this is what's this file here this is

[16:07:36 - 16:07:40]
actually Korean super base let's take a

[16:07:38 - 16:07:42]
look

[16:07:40 - 16:07:45]
here it depends on what the database is

[16:07:42 - 16:07:47]
backed as await superbase from profile

[16:07:45 - 16:07:50]
select EQ single so we have this kind of

[16:07:47 - 16:07:53]
um query Builder

[16:07:50 - 16:07:57]
here okay so that's really

[16:07:53 - 16:07:57]
clear and then we have sign in with oo

[16:07:57 - 16:08:01]
that's

[16:07:57 - 16:08:02]
fine so nothing super complicated what's

[16:08:01 - 16:08:04]
the name of the table that it's

[16:08:02 - 16:08:05]
expecting it's expecting the table to be

[16:08:04 - 16:08:08]
called

[16:08:05 - 16:08:09]
what profiles okay so let's go ahead and

[16:08:08 - 16:08:10]
see if we can make that ourselves again

[16:08:09 - 16:08:12]
I don't have much experience here but

[16:08:10 - 16:08:15]
we'll create a new project under exam

[16:08:12 - 16:08:18]
Pro this project will be called um I'm

[16:08:15 - 16:08:18]
going to call it code

[16:08:19 - 16:08:24]
connectory by the way uh everything you

[16:08:21 - 16:08:25]
create here is public initially so just

[16:08:24 - 16:08:27]
understand if you're creating something

[16:08:25 - 16:08:29]
here that it is public facing initially

[16:08:27 - 16:08:32]
we have code connect tree that's the

[16:08:29 - 16:08:33]
name of this here we have a database

[16:08:32 - 16:08:36]
password so for now I'm just going to

[16:08:33 - 16:08:38]
make the password capital T testing 1 2

[16:08:36 - 16:08:41]
3 4 5 6 exclamation

[16:08:38 - 16:08:43]
mark okay so nothing complex I'm going

[16:08:41 - 16:08:45]
to tearing this down before I publish

[16:08:43 - 16:08:46]
this I'm going to go to uh Canada

[16:08:45 - 16:08:49]
Central that's just where I am let's

[16:08:46 - 16:08:51]
look at other Security Options we have

[16:08:49 - 16:08:54]
data API connection

[16:08:51 - 16:08:55]
string uh I don't know use connection

[16:08:54 - 16:08:58]
string only use post without

[16:08:55 - 16:09:02]
authentication connect to VI uh

[16:08:58 - 16:09:03]
autogenerated HTTP API for post grass it

[16:09:02 - 16:09:06]
really depends on what the code wants so

[16:09:03 - 16:09:08]
we go back over to here and we'll take a

[16:09:06 - 16:09:10]
look so it

[16:09:08 - 16:09:12]
wants the Anon key I don't know what

[16:09:10 - 16:09:14]
that

[16:09:12 - 16:09:17]
is let's go back over here and just make

[16:09:14 - 16:09:17]
sure we know what it is before we do

[16:09:19 - 16:09:24]
that I'm just going to assume it's the

[16:09:21 - 16:09:25]
anous key so base provides two default

[16:09:24 - 16:09:28]
Keys when you create a project the

[16:09:25 - 16:09:32]
nominus key and the service Ro so you

[16:09:28 - 16:09:34]
can find Anon and service Ro under roles

[16:09:32 - 16:09:37]
okay allow Public Access okay fair

[16:09:34 - 16:09:41]
enough that makes sense

[16:09:37 - 16:09:41]
um so I'm not sure what we

[16:09:42 - 16:09:47]
want data API Poli connection string use

[16:09:45 - 16:09:48]
public schema for data API use dedicated

[16:09:47 - 16:09:50]
so we'll stick with the public schema

[16:09:48 - 16:09:52]
quer all tables in the public schema

[16:09:50 - 16:09:54]
yeah that's fine and we'll go ahead and

[16:09:52 - 16:09:55]
create that it's postgress so I know

[16:09:54 - 16:09:57]
postest pretty well so I'm just going to

[16:09:55 - 16:10:00]
to go ahead and hit create

[16:09:57 - 16:10:02]
project and so now we have our API keys

[16:10:00 - 16:10:04]
this is a little bit hard on my eyes I

[16:10:02 - 16:10:07]
wonder if we can switch

[16:10:04 - 16:10:09]
over to dark mode here is there an

[16:10:07 - 16:10:11]
option for that I have an assistant in

[16:10:09 - 16:10:12]
here that's kind of cool everyone has an

[16:10:11 - 16:10:17]
assistant these

[16:10:12 - 16:10:17]
days um but what I'm looking for

[16:10:20 - 16:10:25]
here that's a little bit better their

[16:10:23 - 16:10:27]
fonts a little bit small they must be

[16:10:25 - 16:10:31]
young folk because uh the font's so so

[16:10:27 - 16:10:32]
small here so we have the uh anous

[16:10:31 - 16:10:34]
public key this is a key safe to use in

[16:10:32 - 16:10:36]
a browser if you have enabled Road level

[16:10:34 - 16:10:37]
security for your tables configuration

[16:10:36 - 16:10:40]
policy okay now we obviously can't

[16:10:37 - 16:10:42]
commit this to our code because that

[16:10:40 - 16:10:44]
would be public so this is where we

[16:10:42 - 16:10:46]
would probably download I wasn't ready

[16:10:44 - 16:10:50]
uh to grab the keys here yet um but we

[16:10:46 - 16:10:51]
want to um download our code base and

[16:10:50 - 16:10:53]
start using it because I'm not going to

[16:10:51 - 16:10:56]
be able to plug that stuff in here I'd

[16:10:53 - 16:10:59]
have to um download this code base so

[16:10:56 - 16:11:01]
I'm going to go over to here and I'm can

[16:10:59 - 16:11:03]
assume this all uses just GitHub oops I

[16:11:01 - 16:11:04]
opened up GitHub GitHub Cod Spaces by

[16:11:03 - 16:11:06]
accident but I'm going to go ahead and

[16:11:04 - 16:11:08]
grab this here I'm going to go to my

[16:11:06 - 16:11:12]
local developer

[16:11:08 - 16:11:14]
environment um I mean I suppose we could

[16:11:12 - 16:11:15]
use get

[16:11:14 - 16:11:18]
pod

[16:11:15 - 16:11:19]
um yeah let's use get pod here today

[16:11:18 - 16:11:21]
that's totally

[16:11:19 - 16:11:25]
fine again you can use whatever you want

[16:11:21 - 16:11:27]
this just an easier way for me to do it

[16:11:25 - 16:11:29]
I'm not sure if g g pod uh this version

[16:11:27 - 16:11:30]
classic is going to go away at some

[16:11:29 - 16:11:33]
point but uh if if it is we will have

[16:11:30 - 16:11:35]
additional videos on how to utilize uh G

[16:11:33 - 16:11:37]
pod locally but anyway I'm just going to

[16:11:35 - 16:11:40]
open this up

[16:11:37 - 16:11:40]
here

[16:11:41 - 16:11:45]
okay there's also some additional code

[16:11:43 - 16:11:47]
that lovable throws in here which I

[16:11:45 - 16:11:49]
don't personally like but they need it

[16:11:47 - 16:11:50]
to in order to generate stuff so if I go

[16:11:49 - 16:11:53]
into like the index

[16:11:50 - 16:11:54]
HTML they'll have like GPT engineer

[16:11:53 - 16:11:56]
which is their their module in here so

[16:11:54 - 16:11:58]
like in production you'd probably want

[16:11:56 - 16:11:59]
to rip that out after you're done using

[16:11:58 - 16:12:02]
um

[16:11:59 - 16:12:05]
lovable but this is starting up

[16:12:02 - 16:12:07]
um I suppose the server I didn't create

[16:12:05 - 16:12:09]
a dogod yaml but it seems to already

[16:12:07 - 16:12:11]
know here what to run if you're doing

[16:12:09 - 16:12:15]
this locally then you'd probably have to

[16:12:11 - 16:12:16]
write um mpm run uh Dev that's probably

[16:12:15 - 16:12:18]
what it's doing right here because I

[16:12:16 - 16:12:19]
didn't I didn't give it any commands

[16:12:18 - 16:12:22]
right but I'll just go ahead and type

[16:12:19 - 16:12:25]
npm runev we'll just bump it up a bit

[16:12:22 - 16:12:26]
here so we can see what we're doing MPN

[16:12:25 - 16:12:30]
run Dev before you even do that you'd

[16:12:26 - 16:12:32]
have to do mpm install

[16:12:30 - 16:12:34]
Okay and

[16:12:32 - 16:12:37]
then MPN

[16:12:34 - 16:12:38]
runev okay so it started on Port Local

[16:12:37 - 16:12:41]
Host 880 so I'm going to open up local

[16:12:38 - 16:12:43]
Port 880 here if I go to this tab here

[16:12:41 - 16:12:46]
and click the link then I can preview

[16:12:43 - 16:12:47]
the website here and it shouldn't

[16:12:46 - 16:12:53]
exactly work because we haven't

[16:12:47 - 16:12:57]
configured um our uh our file there

[16:12:53 - 16:12:59]
for uh super base so in here we need to

[16:12:57 - 16:13:01]
configure um these two

[16:12:59 - 16:13:03]
values and it would probably make sense

[16:13:01 - 16:13:07]
if we imported these as environment

[16:13:03 - 16:13:11]
variables so

[16:13:07 - 16:13:15]
um go over here how would

[16:13:11 - 16:13:18]
I import uh environment

[16:13:15 - 16:13:20]
variables for these

[16:13:18 - 16:13:22]
two okay I don't really want it to

[16:13:20 - 16:13:24]
update the code but it probably

[16:13:22 - 16:13:27]
will actually that's fine if it does we

[16:13:24 - 16:13:27]
can just pull

[16:13:32 - 16:13:36]
that instead we're already connected to

[16:13:35 - 16:13:38]
superbase the connection details

[16:13:36 - 16:13:40]
automatically managed by lovable super

[16:13:38 - 16:13:41]
base integration you can simply modify

[16:13:40 - 16:13:43]
the super base client connection to use

[16:13:41 - 16:13:45]
the built-in super based

[16:13:43 - 16:13:49]
connection okay well I guess my thought

[16:13:45 - 16:13:49]
is like are those things safe to

[16:13:50 - 16:13:57]
use oh did it actually just pull in mine

[16:13:53 - 16:13:57]
or did it just make up something

[16:13:57 - 16:14:02]
now I'm really

[16:13:59 - 16:14:06]
curious because we have v

[16:14:02 - 16:14:09]
wfj no no so again I'm not sure if it's

[16:14:06 - 16:14:13]
safe to do that but um these are public

[16:14:09 - 16:14:16]
facing like they didn't hide them so

[16:14:13 - 16:14:16]
maybe it's okay let's go back up

[16:14:21 - 16:14:25]
here I don't know maybe it's okay to

[16:14:23 - 16:14:26]
utilize them but I I don't know I feel

[16:14:25 - 16:14:28]
more comfortable passing them as

[16:14:26 - 16:14:29]
environment variables but uh they don't

[16:14:28 - 16:14:33]
seem to be doing that so I'm just going

[16:14:29 - 16:14:36]
to go ahead here and I'm just going to

[16:14:33 - 16:14:39]
ignore these for now one second discard

[16:14:36 - 16:14:42]
changes I'm just going to

[16:14:39 - 16:14:45]
pull because this file has

[16:14:42 - 16:14:47]
changed oh maybe they

[16:14:45 - 16:14:48]
haven't maybe they're just showing me

[16:14:47 - 16:14:53]
the change and they actually haven't

[16:14:48 - 16:14:53]
changed it okay that's fine and

[16:14:53 - 16:14:57]
um again I'm going to end tearing this

[16:14:55 - 16:14:58]
down so it's not a big deal but you know

[16:14:57 - 16:15:01]
for test purposes I suppose we can do

[16:14:58 - 16:15:04]
this I just want to see if it works

[16:15:01 - 16:15:07]
right like if their code was uh is good

[16:15:04 - 16:15:08]
so I'll bring that in here if you're not

[16:15:07 - 16:15:10]
comfortable doing this because uh you're

[16:15:08 - 16:15:12]
building something for real then that's

[16:15:10 - 16:15:13]
totally fine but uh I don't think we're

[16:15:12 - 16:15:15]
where's an issue because we're both on

[16:15:13 - 16:15:17]
two free tier stuff

[16:15:15 - 16:15:20]
and I can't imagine much damage being

[16:15:17 - 16:15:21]
done here so now we have created uh or

[16:15:20 - 16:15:23]
we've hooked up these two links here so

[16:15:21 - 16:15:25]
I'm going to go back over to terminal

[16:15:23 - 16:15:27]
here I'm going to stop we probably don't

[16:15:25 - 16:15:29]
have to stop and start it we'll go back

[16:15:27 - 16:15:31]
over to here and so I mean we have this

[16:15:29 - 16:15:33]
configured but I don't know if we

[16:15:31 - 16:15:34]
enabled

[16:15:33 - 16:15:39]
authentication

[16:15:34 - 16:15:39]
um and we did also didn't create a

[16:15:39 - 16:15:44]
database um so how is it going to do

[16:15:43 - 16:15:45]
this if we don't have authentication

[16:15:44 - 16:15:47]
turned on and we don't have databases

[16:15:45 - 16:15:48]
turned on well that's fine let's just

[16:15:47 - 16:15:52]
see what happens so I'm going to go back

[16:15:48 - 16:15:54]
over to here and I have this running I'm

[16:15:52 - 16:15:56]
just going to try to log in with GitHub

[16:15:54 - 16:15:57]
supported provider provider is not

[16:15:56 - 16:15:59]
enabled okay so that's what I was

[16:15:57 - 16:16:01]
thinking I mean I don't necessarily want

[16:15:59 - 16:16:05]
GitHub as the provider but

[16:16:01 - 16:16:05]
uh this is

[16:16:06 - 16:16:11]
connected I mean this is fine but how

[16:16:09 - 16:16:13]
did we

[16:16:11 - 16:16:17]
get that Olo maybe it's like hooks in

[16:16:13 - 16:16:17]
here add a new

[16:16:20 - 16:16:26]
hook maybe it's under Integrations

[16:16:22 - 16:16:27]
because that one looks pretty plain

[16:16:26 - 16:16:29]
and also I said it was for developers so

[16:16:27 - 16:16:30]
I kind of it kind of makes sense why

[16:16:29 - 16:16:35]
they were trying to do that so we'll go

[16:16:30 - 16:16:35]
ahead and say say superbase GitHub

[16:16:36 - 16:16:40]
login to enable GitHub off for your

[16:16:38 - 16:16:41]
project you need to set up GitHub o

[16:16:40 - 16:16:43]
application add the application

[16:16:41 - 16:16:45]
credentials to your superbas dashboard

[16:16:43 - 16:16:47]
so create and configure GitHub ooth app

[16:16:45 - 16:16:49]
in GitHub add GitHub ooth keys to your

[16:16:47 - 16:16:53]
superbas project add the login code to

[16:16:49 - 16:16:54]
the superbas JS Client app okay so I

[16:16:53 - 16:16:57]
want to know where this gets at it add

[16:16:54 - 16:16:59]
your GitHub to the super based project

[16:16:57 - 16:17:02]
where so we go back over to

[16:16:59 - 16:17:06]
here and I would have thought that it

[16:17:02 - 16:17:09]
would been under here but maybe it's not

[16:17:06 - 16:17:11]
um maybe go to Project settings

[16:17:09 - 16:17:13]
here

[16:17:11 - 16:17:15]
and we have

[16:17:13 - 16:17:18]
configurations maybe

[16:17:15 - 16:17:20]
API like where would

[16:17:18 - 16:17:22]
I where would I add that it's not very

[16:17:20 - 16:17:26]
clear is

[16:17:22 - 16:17:28]
it to your super based project

[16:17:26 - 16:17:29]
mhm okay we'll go back here for a second

[16:17:28 - 16:17:33]
wait hold

[16:17:29 - 16:17:33]
on no I don't see anything

[16:17:33 - 16:17:36]
there well here we have the full steps

[16:17:35 - 16:17:39]
right

[16:17:36 - 16:17:42]
so go to here go to authentication go to

[16:17:39 - 16:17:42]
Providers

[16:17:43 - 16:17:52]
okay so go back over to super base here

[16:17:48 - 16:17:53]
authentication providers oh okay

[16:17:52 - 16:17:55]
actually they have quite a bit that's

[16:17:53 - 16:17:57]
really good and so here somewhere there

[16:17:55 - 16:18:00]
is

[16:17:57 - 16:18:02]
GitHub and so we'd want to enable

[16:18:00 - 16:18:05]
that by filling that information but

[16:18:02 - 16:18:10]
first we have to go ahead and create a

[16:18:05 - 16:18:13]
project find your car call back URL okay

[16:18:10 - 16:18:15]
so this is the step that requires a call

[16:18:13 - 16:18:17]
back URL which looks like this the only

[16:18:15 - 16:18:19]
thing is that this project here well I

[16:18:17 - 16:18:20]
guess it's this is Project Specific so

[16:18:19 - 16:18:24]
that's not a much of a

[16:18:20 - 16:18:26]
problem okay authentication providers

[16:18:24 - 16:18:29]
find your call back value here let's go

[16:18:26 - 16:18:29]
back over to

[16:18:29 - 16:18:34]
here and does it say where okay it's

[16:18:32 - 16:18:37]
right here okay so we have that that's

[16:18:34 - 16:18:38]
fine so it wants us to copy that then we

[16:18:37 - 16:18:40]
need to go to the ooth page on GitHub so

[16:18:38 - 16:18:41]
you would have to have a GitHub account

[16:18:40 - 16:18:43]
you can have you have to see swimmer is

[16:18:41 - 16:18:47]
a really old app I made a long time ago

[16:18:43 - 16:18:50]
and this one's going to be called um

[16:18:47 - 16:18:53]
code connect

[16:18:50 - 16:18:55]
tree this doesn't have a proper URL

[16:18:53 - 16:18:57]
because it's not a real app application

[16:18:55 - 16:18:59]
yet but we

[16:18:57 - 16:19:01]
could is this going to work if we don't

[16:18:59 - 16:19:03]
actually have a proper one I'm not sure

[16:19:01 - 16:19:03]
how that would

[16:19:05 - 16:19:10]
work so for

[16:19:08 - 16:19:12]
now I'm just going to use because giop

[16:19:10 - 16:19:14]
is it is public so I'm going to try to

[16:19:12 - 16:19:16]
use G pod for

[16:19:14 - 16:19:18]
now I'm not sure if that would work I'm

[16:19:16 - 16:19:22]
going to just open that up and so going

[16:19:18 - 16:19:24]
to go here uh simple L simple link Tree

[16:19:22 - 16:19:26]
app

[16:19:24 - 16:19:30]
and then we need that call back URL

[16:19:26 - 16:19:33]
which I still have open here okay and

[16:19:30 - 16:19:35]
then we go to here allow oo apps to

[16:19:33 - 16:19:37]
authorize via device flow I don't know

[16:19:35 - 16:19:38]
what device flow is but it does say oh

[16:19:37 - 16:19:40]
keep it

[16:19:38 - 16:19:42]
unchecked okay so we'll go ahead and

[16:19:40 - 16:19:45]
register the application and so now we

[16:19:42 - 16:19:46]
have a client ID and client secret I'm

[16:19:45 - 16:19:48]
going to copy that I mean clearly that

[16:19:46 - 16:19:51]
must be what we need to

[16:19:48 - 16:19:52]
copy and we'll go back over to here and

[16:19:51 - 16:19:55]
so I'll put the client ID here I'll

[16:19:52 - 16:19:56]
generate a new client Secret

[16:19:55 - 16:19:58]
I will have to authenticate with my

[16:19:56 - 16:20:01]
GitHub mobile it depends if you have two

[16:19:58 - 16:20:01]
Factor on I do have two Factor

[16:20:05 - 16:20:10]
on

[16:20:07 - 16:20:11]
and Y just getting my phone to go here

[16:20:10 - 16:20:13]
my phone's acting a little bit slow here

[16:20:11 - 16:20:17]
today not sure

[16:20:13 - 16:20:19]
why come on phone you can do it just a

[16:20:17 - 16:20:20]
moment sometimes when the request goes

[16:20:19 - 16:20:22]
to my phone it doesn't show up so I'm

[16:20:20 - 16:20:24]
going to hit retry again I just had to

[16:20:22 - 16:20:25]
wait for it to time out and so now I'm

[16:20:24 - 16:20:27]
going to go try this

[16:20:25 - 16:20:30]
again okay and so I'm just entering in

[16:20:27 - 16:20:31]
the two digits on my phone here and that

[16:20:30 - 16:20:34]
will get us through here from GitHub

[16:20:31 - 16:20:35]
mobile and so I've just generated a

[16:20:34 - 16:20:37]
secret of course do not share these

[16:20:35 - 16:20:39]
secrets with anybody else I'm going to

[16:20:37 - 16:20:40]
get get rid of my secret here eventually

[16:20:39 - 16:20:43]
so it's not a big deal I'm going to go

[16:20:40 - 16:20:44]
ahead and hit save um I really should be

[16:20:43 - 16:20:46]
paying attention closely to the

[16:20:44 - 16:20:47]
instructions here as there is more to

[16:20:46 - 16:20:49]
fill

[16:20:47 - 16:20:52]
in not really I mean we just don't have

[16:20:49 - 16:20:53]
a Graphic so now copy that over enter

[16:20:52 - 16:20:56]
your GitHub credentials into your super

[16:20:53 - 16:20:56]
base so

[16:20:56 - 16:21:01]
I believe that's what we just did yes

[16:20:59 - 16:21:03]
click on the GitHub according listen

[16:21:01 - 16:21:05]
expand GitHub on so once we actually

[16:21:03 - 16:21:08]
have it entered

[16:21:05 - 16:21:10]
in we will enable it and we'll hit

[16:21:08 - 16:21:13]
save I mean if it's that easy that'd be

[16:21:10 - 16:21:14]
really awesome I'd be really pumped add

[16:21:13 - 16:21:16]
the login code to your client app so

[16:21:14 - 16:21:18]
make sure you're using the right super

[16:21:16 - 16:21:21]
based client with the following code so

[16:21:18 - 16:21:23]
this says sign in with GitHub GitHub I

[16:21:21 - 16:21:25]
mean I would think that's what it did if

[16:21:23 - 16:21:28]
we don't know for ER let's go over to

[16:21:25 - 16:21:28]
our commit history and check

[16:21:29 - 16:21:34]
again okay that was junk coded added

[16:21:31 - 16:21:36]
which we've already uh

[16:21:34 - 16:21:39]
replaced and so in

[16:21:36 - 16:21:42]
here I just want to see if it added that

[16:21:39 - 16:21:42]
code correctly based on their

[16:21:43 - 16:21:48]
recommendation it looks like it is yeah

[16:21:45 - 16:21:49]
it looks correct variant destructive it

[16:21:48 - 16:21:50]
might be slightly different this one has

[16:21:49 - 16:21:53]
a variant destructive on it which is

[16:21:50 - 16:21:56]
totally fine I don't really care um so

[16:21:53 - 16:22:00]
that seems fine let's go back over to

[16:21:56 - 16:22:00]
here uh sign

[16:22:00 - 16:22:05]
out routes I don't know if we need all

[16:22:03 - 16:22:06]
of this but you know let's see if it it

[16:22:05 - 16:22:08]
just works so I'm going to go back over

[16:22:06 - 16:22:09]
to our app here going give this a nice

[16:22:08 - 16:22:11]
hard

[16:22:09 - 16:22:13]
refresh and let's go ahead and click

[16:22:11 - 16:22:14]
this I did not mean to do this but it

[16:22:13 - 16:22:16]
actually did open to the correct

[16:22:14 - 16:22:19]
location we're

[16:22:16 - 16:22:23]
authorizing that looks good so

[16:22:19 - 16:22:24]
far um it's trying to redirect back to

[16:22:23 - 16:22:27]
Local Host 3000 which is not not where

[16:22:24 - 16:22:29]
this is running I'm not sure why it did

[16:22:27 - 16:22:32]
that as that is not correct sometimes

[16:22:29 - 16:22:34]
you have to specify where the redirect

[16:22:32 - 16:22:34]
is here it's showing this right this is

[16:22:34 - 16:22:36]
the

[16:22:34 - 16:22:38]
redirect okay but for some reason it's

[16:22:36 - 16:22:41]
sent to the Local Host

[16:22:38 - 16:22:42]
3000 I wonder if anywhere in the code it

[16:22:41 - 16:22:44]
specified that so I'm going to go ahead

[16:22:42 - 16:22:46]
and find in files and we're going to

[16:22:44 - 16:22:46]
search for

[16:22:47 - 16:22:50]
3,000 yeah there's nothing that says

[16:22:49 - 16:22:52]
that it would redirect to Local Host

[16:22:50 - 16:22:55]
3000 so that's kind of annoying but

[16:22:52 - 16:23:00]
maybe what we could do is

[16:22:55 - 16:23:01]
cheat where did that URL go here and

[16:23:00 - 16:23:03]
obviously that's not correct but what

[16:23:01 - 16:23:05]
I'm going to do is just grab this link

[16:23:03 - 16:23:07]
here because I I don't know why it did

[16:23:05 - 16:23:09]
that honestly take out the double for

[16:23:07 - 16:23:13]
slash here hit enter and so now we're

[16:23:09 - 16:23:14]
signed in so this actually worked um but

[16:23:13 - 16:23:16]
it says public links does not exist

[16:23:14 - 16:23:18]
because there's no data in the

[16:23:16 - 16:23:20]
database so and this app doesn't have a

[16:23:18 - 16:23:22]
way to insert data now we could tell it

[16:23:20 - 16:23:24]
to like give us a way to add that stuff

[16:23:22 - 16:23:26]
but I don't really care um I just want

[16:23:24 - 16:23:30]
to again see how far we can get here

[16:23:26 - 16:23:33]
just a little bit so we need to add some

[16:23:30 - 16:23:35]
tables and I think one of the tables it

[16:23:33 - 16:23:38]
was asking for was links but let's go

[16:23:35 - 16:23:38]
check our code to be certain What It

[16:23:39 - 16:23:47]
Wants

[16:23:41 - 16:23:51]
okay and in here we have components

[16:23:47 - 16:23:53]
um I think it's more like the top level

[16:23:51 - 16:23:54]
if we go to appt CU like it goes index

[16:23:53 - 16:23:57]
or Main and then app

[16:23:54 - 16:23:59]
possibly so main loads app right and

[16:23:57 - 16:24:03]
then inside of app we

[16:23:59 - 16:24:05]
have um our routes to this page which is

[16:24:03 - 16:24:08]
to our index page so in our there's

[16:24:05 - 16:24:11]
probably a Pages folder maybe here it is

[16:24:08 - 16:24:13]
called index and so an index I would

[16:24:11 - 16:24:15]
imagine that this would fetch the data

[16:24:13 - 16:24:16]
so here we have the Au and it says fetch

[16:24:15 - 16:24:19]
profile and fetch links so we clearly

[16:24:16 - 16:24:22]
have two types of

[16:24:19 - 16:24:26]
databases uh we have a profile in

[16:24:22 - 16:24:27]
links and it says says get profiles ID

[16:24:26 - 16:24:30]
with everything so there's clearly an ID

[16:24:27 - 16:24:31]
for links we have a profile ID and Stu

[16:24:30 - 16:24:36]
uh created

[16:24:31 - 16:24:38]
at it'd be really nice to know what data

[16:24:36 - 16:24:41]
here

[16:24:38 - 16:24:44]
um as it's not very clear so I'm going

[16:24:41 - 16:24:48]
to go back here and just like what is

[16:24:44 - 16:24:51]
the database what is the table

[16:24:48 - 16:24:53]
structure for links and profile because

[16:24:51 - 16:24:55]
we don't know it didn't tell us anywhere

[16:24:53 - 16:24:56]
right so we'll tell it to do that for us

[16:24:55 - 16:24:59]
and then it'll maybe it'll tell us what

[16:24:56 - 16:25:02]
it is all right let's see what it uh

[16:24:59 - 16:25:05]
suggested here so here we have our table

[16:25:02 - 16:25:08]
structure um we'll go back over to super

[16:25:05 - 16:25:11]
base and we'll try to match it here so

[16:25:08 - 16:25:13]
the first it says is profiles table I

[16:25:11 - 16:25:16]
believe it's I I believe it's called

[16:25:13 - 16:25:19]
profiles I really hate how uh this keeps

[16:25:16 - 16:25:23]
popping up here uh yeah yeah yeah stop

[16:25:19 - 16:25:25]
trying to fill it in okay

[16:25:23 - 16:25:26]
profiles like always shows me my

[16:25:25 - 16:25:27]
birthday if anybody ever wants to get me

[16:25:26 - 16:25:30]
something for my birthday you know my

[16:25:27 - 16:25:32]
birthday now uh so have profiles enable

[16:25:30 - 16:25:34]
row level security oh that's cool

[16:25:32 - 16:25:35]
policies are required to query data you

[16:25:34 - 16:25:36]
need to access you need to create an

[16:25:35 - 16:25:38]
access policy before you can query data

[16:25:36 - 16:25:40]
from this table without a policy

[16:25:38 - 16:25:42]
querying return empty array weate

[16:25:40 - 16:25:43]
policies after saving this table fair

[16:25:42 - 16:25:46]
enough we'll go ahead and create a

[16:25:43 - 16:25:46]
profiles

[16:25:46 - 16:25:54]
table okay uh I didn't specify any

[16:25:50 - 16:25:57]
columns oh they're down here okay okay

[16:25:54 - 16:25:57]
so we need

[16:25:57 - 16:26:04]
username this would be

[16:26:00 - 16:26:07]
text um we'll need full

[16:26:04 - 16:26:10]
name this will be

[16:26:07 - 16:26:13]
text we'll do Avatar

[16:26:10 - 16:26:17]
URL this will be

[16:26:13 - 16:26:20]
text we will do uh

[16:26:17 - 16:26:22]
bio this will be

[16:26:20 - 16:26:26]
text we will do uh we have created it

[16:26:22 - 16:26:26]
already so we'll go ahead and save

[16:26:31 - 16:26:36]
that and we'll do

[16:26:34 - 16:26:37]
links we'll scroll down now that we

[16:26:36 - 16:26:39]
learned that it's down there below I

[16:26:37 - 16:26:40]
mean I'm kind of zoomed in so it kind of

[16:26:39 - 16:26:42]
explains why we can't see it so here we

[16:26:40 - 16:26:43]
have profile ID this one we want to link

[16:26:42 - 16:26:45]
to the other ones I'm assuming that

[16:26:43 - 16:26:47]
that's the way I didn't know I just

[16:26:45 - 16:26:49]
assume that's how we link it so we'll

[16:26:47 - 16:26:52]
link that one over to

[16:26:49 - 16:26:54]
the oh that one wants to go to the uyu

[16:26:52 - 16:26:55]
ID h

[16:26:54 - 16:26:58]
I

[16:26:55 - 16:27:00]
mean yeah I don't care I'm just going to

[16:26:58 - 16:27:01]
it didn't make uid so I'm just going to

[16:27:00 - 16:27:03]
stick with that I mean this one we might

[16:27:01 - 16:27:05]
be able to change a u ID but I don't I

[16:27:03 - 16:27:08]
don't think it

[16:27:05 - 16:27:09]
matters so in this in this case it's not

[16:27:08 - 16:27:13]
going to hurt anything because I don't

[16:27:09 - 16:27:13]
think we're quering based on U ID

[16:27:13 - 16:27:16]
so

[16:27:18 - 16:27:21]
text

[16:27:19 - 16:27:25]
text just a

[16:27:21 - 16:27:25]
second um

[16:27:28 - 16:27:35]
description

[16:27:30 - 16:27:35]
text tags is assessing an

[16:27:36 - 16:27:42]
array uh

[16:27:39 - 16:27:42]
text okay but how would I do an

[16:27:48 - 16:27:56]
array if I don't see the option for

[16:27:51 - 16:27:56]
array defined as array there we go

[16:27:59 - 16:28:03]
pretty uh pretty easy so far all right

[16:28:01 - 16:28:05]
let's go ahead and save that

[16:28:03 - 16:28:07]
table and probably as the other one is

[16:28:05 - 16:28:08]
going to suggest we need policies in

[16:28:07 - 16:28:14]
order to utilize these tables let's go

[16:28:08 - 16:28:14]
over to here and uh we'll create a

[16:28:15 - 16:28:18]
policy

[16:28:19 - 16:28:24]
um full policy

[16:28:22 - 16:28:26]
here we have links permit to select all

[16:28:24 - 16:28:29]
from

[16:28:26 - 16:28:32]
using andon so basically saying that

[16:28:29 - 16:28:34]
they can please provide anql expression

[16:28:32 - 16:28:36]
using the using statement oh come on I

[16:28:34 - 16:28:40]
don't want have to do anything uh select

[16:28:36 - 16:28:40]
read access for all users what I do

[16:28:44 - 16:28:49]
that yeah isn't that

[16:28:47 - 16:28:56]
it there we

[16:28:49 - 16:28:56]
go we'll create one for profiles here

[16:28:57 - 16:29:00]
oh maybe that's not just for

[16:29:01 - 16:29:05]
Anan okay let's go back here for a

[16:29:03 - 16:29:07]
second I mean it's not a big deal again

[16:29:05 - 16:29:10]
we're just testing things but right now

[16:29:07 - 16:29:10]
this one I think was set

[16:29:10 - 16:29:15]
to we set a na here then it would just

[16:29:12 - 16:29:19]
be this if I click this it sets it to

[16:29:15 - 16:29:19]
everybody I think let me go back to

[16:29:21 - 16:29:26]
this can I save that there we go

[16:29:24 - 16:29:29]
[Music]

[16:29:26 - 16:29:31]
um and I mean right now it doesn't

[16:29:29 - 16:29:33]
really matter with our policy because it

[16:29:31 - 16:29:33]
is

[16:29:33 - 16:29:38]
um like now it's set to non is that you

[16:29:36 - 16:29:39]
have to log in to utilize the service

[16:29:38 - 16:29:41]
anyway so it's not a really proper link

[16:29:39 - 16:29:43]
tree but anyway now that we have these

[16:29:41 - 16:29:46]
tables let's go back over to here and

[16:29:43 - 16:29:46]
see what we

[16:29:47 - 16:29:54]
get input syntax error big int so it

[16:29:52 - 16:29:57]
might be an issue with the

[16:29:54 - 16:29:59]
um the ID

[16:29:57 - 16:30:01]
as I mean I said it didn't matter but

[16:29:59 - 16:30:04]
like maybe because it's saying bigant

[16:30:01 - 16:30:06]
right I wonder if we could change over

[16:30:04 - 16:30:10]
these tables let's see

[16:30:06 - 16:30:12]
here uh we'll go back over to our

[16:30:10 - 16:30:15]
tables it's not proper but maybe I can

[16:30:12 - 16:30:17]
change this to Big

[16:30:15 - 16:30:21]
end okay that's great I'm going to go to

[16:30:17 - 16:30:23]
tables here let's edit our

[16:30:21 - 16:30:26]
table it's crazy I can just like switch

[16:30:23 - 16:30:28]
things on the fly like this I mean like

[16:30:26 - 16:30:30]
in a good way as long as you know what

[16:30:28 - 16:30:32]
you're doing it's not that big of a deal

[16:30:30 - 16:30:33]
and so in the original one I think

[16:30:32 - 16:30:36]
they're using U

[16:30:33 - 16:30:40]
ID but I don't think that's

[16:30:36 - 16:30:42]
big because they say U ID here but then

[16:30:40 - 16:30:45]
in the search it was doing that I mean

[16:30:42 - 16:30:45]
we can just change

[16:30:45 - 16:30:50]
it canot type big to

[16:30:50 - 16:30:55]
uid okay well maybe it already is big in

[16:30:53 - 16:30:56]
let's go back over here I I'm fine with

[16:30:55 - 16:30:59]
regular IDs I just have to figure out

[16:30:56 - 16:31:02]
what it is inal syntax for big this

[16:30:59 - 16:31:04]
value okay so that looks like a uid and

[16:31:02 - 16:31:07]
so maybe it's hardcoded for a very

[16:31:04 - 16:31:09]
specific value in our our code base here

[16:31:07 - 16:31:12]
so if we go to our profile here that's

[16:31:09 - 16:31:12]
that's not very useful we go to our

[16:31:12 - 16:31:20]
index I'm trying to find this

[16:31:16 - 16:31:22]
information um now the thing is is

[16:31:20 - 16:31:25]
that our table like when we created our

[16:31:22 - 16:31:27]
user in GitHub it probably returned back

[16:31:25 - 16:31:29]
a user ID and The UU ID is that's what

[16:31:27 - 16:31:30]
it is and so probably what we have to do

[16:31:29 - 16:31:32]
is recreate these tables so I know this

[16:31:30 - 16:31:34]
is a bit of a mess but I think we're

[16:31:32 - 16:31:36]
going to have to delete this policy and

[16:31:34 - 16:31:37]
delete this and then just make those

[16:31:36 - 16:31:39]
tables

[16:31:37 - 16:31:40]
again um as that's what I'm thinking is

[16:31:39 - 16:31:42]
happening there that's that's that

[16:31:40 - 16:31:45]
relationship there because it's not

[16:31:42 - 16:31:47]
going to let me recreate that table like

[16:31:45 - 16:31:48]
that and we'll just keep dropping that

[16:31:47 - 16:31:51]
it's not a big

[16:31:48 - 16:31:53]
deal a little bit timec consuming but

[16:31:51 - 16:31:54]
not too bad so we'll go ahead and now

[16:31:53 - 16:31:56]
we'll create this table against so we'll

[16:31:54 - 16:32:00]
have um uh profiles and this one

[16:31:56 - 16:32:02]
definitely has to be uh uu ID so we'll

[16:32:00 - 16:32:05]
go back down here to U

[16:32:02 - 16:32:08]
ID U ID there we

[16:32:05 - 16:32:11]
go and then we'll add additional tables

[16:32:08 - 16:32:12]
here one moment sorry I just disabled

[16:32:11 - 16:32:14]
Dash Lan because it keeps popping up and

[16:32:12 - 16:32:17]
that's really annoying for me but we

[16:32:14 - 16:32:19]
have uh username full name Avatar URL

[16:32:17 - 16:32:21]
bio okay so we have I'm just going to

[16:32:19 - 16:32:22]
pull this off screen so I can uh quickly

[16:32:21 - 16:32:24]
do

[16:32:22 - 16:32:26]
this we have

[16:32:24 - 16:32:26]
um

[16:32:28 - 16:32:34]
username

[16:32:30 - 16:32:34]
okay we have full

[16:32:35 - 16:32:41]
name we

[16:32:37 - 16:32:41]
have Avatar

[16:32:42 - 16:32:46]
URL we have

[16:32:47 - 16:32:53]
bio okay so this time we made sure that

[16:32:50 - 16:32:54]
our primary key is a uid so go ahead and

[16:32:53 - 16:32:57]
Save

[16:32:54 - 16:33:00]
that we will now go ahead and create the

[16:32:57 - 16:33:03]
other table which is

[16:33:00 - 16:33:04]
links um it's saying that it's also uid

[16:33:03 - 16:33:07]
I mean if one's going to be uid we might

[16:33:04 - 16:33:11]
as well do both as uids no no reason not

[16:33:07 - 16:33:13]
to and so here we have um profile ID

[16:33:11 - 16:33:17]
which is going to be linked to the other

[16:33:13 - 16:33:21]
table here specifically to that ID here

[16:33:17 - 16:33:24]
and then we will add the uh

[16:33:21 - 16:33:27]
title text

[16:33:24 - 16:33:29]
then we will also add the

[16:33:27 - 16:33:31]
URL

[16:33:29 - 16:33:35]
text we will also

[16:33:31 - 16:33:35]
add the

[16:33:36 - 16:33:39]
tags

[16:33:40 - 16:33:50]
text and Define that as an

[16:33:45 - 16:33:51]
array okay so tags text URL

[16:33:50 - 16:33:54]
title

[16:33:51 - 16:33:58]
um URL tags title

[16:33:54 - 16:33:58]
profile ID and we'll go ahead and save

[16:34:01 - 16:34:08]
that okay so that is now

[16:34:06 - 16:34:10]
saved table links have been updated but

[16:34:08 - 16:34:12]
there were some

[16:34:10 - 16:34:14]
errors I'm not sure if that's good or

[16:34:12 - 16:34:15]
bad I'm noticing that this has fewer

[16:34:14 - 16:34:17]
columns the last one had seven I'm not

[16:34:15 - 16:34:19]
sure why this one only has

[16:34:17 - 16:34:21]
six but uh we'll go back over to here I

[16:34:19 - 16:34:23]
mean it looks like it created them so

[16:34:21 - 16:34:26]
I'm not sure what it's talking about

[16:34:23 - 16:34:28]
and by updated we just created it I mean

[16:34:26 - 16:34:30]
they're still there so I'm just going to

[16:34:28 - 16:34:32]
ignore that error for now and I'll

[16:34:30 - 16:34:34]
create a new policy and just say select

[16:34:32 - 16:34:37]
all from all and then just only set it

[16:34:34 - 16:34:39]
to Aon and we'll save that

[16:34:37 - 16:34:40]
policy and because we we'll insert data

[16:34:39 - 16:34:43]
but we'll probably do it through the

[16:34:40 - 16:34:45]
interface here and so that way um uh

[16:34:43 - 16:34:48]
it's not like the app has to do it this

[16:34:45 - 16:34:48]
thing has to get out of the freaking

[16:34:49 - 16:34:55]
way okay we'll save that policy here

[16:34:54 - 16:34:57]
okay I'm again not sure what's wrong

[16:34:55 - 16:34:58]
with the table it seems like it's fine

[16:34:57 - 16:35:01]
to me and we'll go back here give it a

[16:34:58 - 16:35:03]
refresh so it says Json object requested

[16:35:01 - 16:35:05]
multiple or no rows return and that's

[16:35:03 - 16:35:07]
fair because there isn't uh any data

[16:35:05 - 16:35:09]
there right now and so we need to create

[16:35:07 - 16:35:14]
a profile but right now I don't know

[16:35:09 - 16:35:15]
what the um the profile URL is because

[16:35:14 - 16:35:17]
when it's set up it's not like it

[16:35:15 - 16:35:18]
inserted a user on the start so

[16:35:17 - 16:35:20]
somewhere in here when it logs in it's

[16:35:18 - 16:35:22]
going to fetch that data and so there's

[16:35:20 - 16:35:25]
a user ID in the session and so I need

[16:35:22 - 16:35:28]
to get that information so I'm going to

[16:35:25 - 16:35:32]
go here and just console log out the

[16:35:28 - 16:35:35]
session. user ID and that way we will be

[16:35:32 - 16:35:37]
able to figure out what the um U ID is

[16:35:35 - 16:35:38]
for this particular user to insert into

[16:35:37 - 16:35:40]
the

[16:35:38 - 16:35:42]
database okay so we'll go back here and

[16:35:40 - 16:35:45]
we'll give this a nice uh refresh here

[16:35:42 - 16:35:47]
so we go back over to here we should

[16:35:45 - 16:35:50]
have logs somewhere here oh but this is

[16:35:47 - 16:35:52]
client side so we would see it over here

[16:35:50 - 16:35:55]
okay so I'm just opening this up this is

[16:35:52 - 16:35:58]
kind of a bit funky and so in here we

[16:35:55 - 16:36:01]
should get um I'm going to refresh this

[16:35:58 - 16:36:03]
we should get it here so this is the U

[16:36:01 - 16:36:05]
ID we need to insert for our profile

[16:36:03 - 16:36:08]
okay so I'm going to copy that I'm going

[16:36:05 - 16:36:11]
to go back over to super base we're

[16:36:08 - 16:36:14]
going to go over to our

[16:36:11 - 16:36:18]
databases we want to insert

[16:36:14 - 16:36:21]
data Maybe table

[16:36:18 - 16:36:23]
editor no SQL editor this is probably

[16:36:21 - 16:36:25]
what we want so I was just opening that

[16:36:23 - 16:36:26]
we could insert data I'll just go back

[16:36:25 - 16:36:28]
to table editor I don't want to create a

[16:36:26 - 16:36:30]
new table oh let's just click into the

[16:36:28 - 16:36:31]
tables here here we go this thing's got

[16:36:30 - 16:36:33]
to get out of here it's really annoying

[16:36:31 - 16:36:36]
me we'll go ahead and we'll insert a new

[16:36:33 - 16:36:37]
row um we're going to give this ID here

[16:36:36 - 16:36:39]
in particular we'll leave this so

[16:36:37 - 16:36:43]
defaults it we're going to say Andrew

[16:36:39 - 16:36:46]
Brown say Andrew Brown and then Andrew

[16:36:43 - 16:36:48]
Brown and we don't have an avatar right

[16:36:46 - 16:36:52]
now we'll just say uh I teach

[16:36:48 - 16:36:55]
Cloud we'll go ahead and save that and

[16:36:52 - 16:36:58]
so now we have saved uh this record in

[16:36:55 - 16:37:01]
here as a profile so that we might still

[16:36:58 - 16:37:03]
have some issues we'll give this a hard

[16:37:01 - 16:37:05]
refresh and so maybe it say error

[16:37:03 - 16:37:08]
fetching profile Jason return requested

[16:37:05 - 16:37:09]
multiple multiple or no row return this

[16:37:08 - 16:37:12]
could be an issue with our policies as

[16:37:09 - 16:37:14]
well as we're not 100% certain but if we

[16:37:12 - 16:37:16]
go down here we have fetch profile right

[16:37:14 - 16:37:18]
and so if we we need to debug this and

[16:37:16 - 16:37:20]
see what we're actually

[16:37:18 - 16:37:22]
getting

[16:37:20 - 16:37:24]
um so if there's an error then it's

[16:37:22 - 16:37:26]
returning this it's basically saying

[16:37:24 - 16:37:29]
there's no data so that makes me think

[16:37:26 - 16:37:32]
that there is an issue with our policies

[16:37:29 - 16:37:32]
so we'll go back over to

[16:37:32 - 16:37:37]
here but just in case because it says

[16:37:34 - 16:37:39]
fetching error fetching profile right so

[16:37:37 - 16:37:41]
we'll go back over to

[16:37:39 - 16:37:43]
superbase and I want to go back to

[16:37:41 - 16:37:46]
policies

[16:37:43 - 16:37:47]
here under database because I didn't

[16:37:46 - 16:37:48]
really learn how these worked I just

[16:37:47 - 16:37:50]
kind of like SK through it enable read

[16:37:48 - 16:37:54]
access for all

[16:37:50 - 16:37:56]
users so we'll edit the policy

[16:37:54 - 16:37:59]
and I'm just going to change it to

[16:37:56 - 16:38:01]
everybody to make this a little bit

[16:37:59 - 16:38:03]
easier and so now it shows up okay so

[16:38:01 - 16:38:04]
obviously a non is not the one that's

[16:38:03 - 16:38:06]
accessing it again I'm not an expert in

[16:38:04 - 16:38:08]
super base but I'm just here to try to

[16:38:06 - 16:38:10]
get it to work here today so even if

[16:38:08 - 16:38:12]
this is not fully proper um we're just

[16:38:10 - 16:38:14]
getting it to work uh for this use case

[16:38:12 - 16:38:16]
Okay this isn't a lesson in sub base

[16:38:14 - 16:38:17]
it's just more like for us to complete

[16:38:16 - 16:38:20]
this we should be able to do both the

[16:38:17 - 16:38:22]
back and front end um and so we'll go

[16:38:20 - 16:38:23]
ahead and just insert some links here so

[16:38:22 - 16:38:25]
despite that error constantly appearing

[16:38:23 - 16:38:27]
here we'll go to the table editor and

[16:38:25 - 16:38:30]
we'll go to Links here I'm going to

[16:38:27 - 16:38:31]
insert a new row we'll just say U we'll

[16:38:30 - 16:38:34]
let it default to whatever it wants we

[16:38:31 - 16:38:38]
will select our profile here and we'll

[16:38:34 - 16:38:38]
just say uh exam Pro and this will be

[16:38:38 - 16:38:45]
https www. exampro

[16:38:41 - 16:38:50]
doco and I mean this is a list of tags

[16:38:45 - 16:38:54]
so this might be Cloud uh AWS gen as an

[16:38:50 - 16:38:55]
example we'll save this not valid array

[16:38:54 - 16:38:56]
well you didn't specify what the array

[16:38:55 - 16:38:59]
is supposed to look like what if I do it

[16:38:56 - 16:38:59]
like this does this

[16:39:01 - 16:39:05]
better maybe this one's not super

[16:39:03 - 16:39:08]
friendly for this we'll save

[16:39:05 - 16:39:09]
that there we go so that worked we'll go

[16:39:08 - 16:39:12]
back over to here we'll give us a hard

[16:39:09 - 16:39:14]
refresh and so now we have this and it

[16:39:12 - 16:39:17]
links and so we've built basically link

[16:39:14 - 16:39:19]
tree in the most basic form um again

[16:39:17 - 16:39:20]
could could do a little bit better than

[16:39:19 - 16:39:24]
this but

[16:39:20 - 16:39:25]
for 30 40 minutes is a pretty darn good

[16:39:24 - 16:39:27]
so let's just go ahead and tear

[16:39:25 - 16:39:30]
everything down now as as I'm completely

[16:39:27 - 16:39:32]
done um so I want to get rid of this

[16:39:30 - 16:39:34]
project so I'm going to go over here to

[16:39:32 - 16:39:35]
the left hand side again I'm on the free

[16:39:34 - 16:39:37]
tier so I'm not really worried about any

[16:39:35 - 16:39:38]
spend but uh in case I have any keys

[16:39:37 - 16:39:39]
that should not be available I want to

[16:39:38 - 16:39:42]
get rid of

[16:39:39 - 16:39:45]
those so we go ahead and type in the

[16:39:42 - 16:39:45]
project name here and delete the

[16:39:46 - 16:39:51]
project good and the app I don't need

[16:39:50 - 16:39:53]
the app anymore in GitHub so I might go

[16:39:51 - 16:39:54]
ahead and get rid of that so back to

[16:39:53 - 16:39:56]
developer settings here I'm just going

[16:39:54 - 16:39:59]
to delete this

[16:39:56 - 16:40:03]
app uh can I delete

[16:39:59 - 16:40:07]
it Advanced delete

[16:40:03 - 16:40:09]
delete okay so now that app is deleted

[16:40:07 - 16:40:12]
and I mean I can commit these changes it

[16:40:09 - 16:40:15]
doesn't really matter but

[16:40:12 - 16:40:19]
um example but you know if you wanted to

[16:40:15 - 16:40:19]
run this yourself you could

[16:40:19 - 16:40:23]
um okay I don't care just commit it

[16:40:22 - 16:40:25]
there we go

[16:40:23 - 16:40:27]
sync and sync and

[16:40:25 - 16:40:29]
deploy but this is actually a public

[16:40:27 - 16:40:32]
repo I believe so if I go over to maybe

[16:40:29 - 16:40:32]
it's not let's go

[16:40:34 - 16:40:39]
see open in GitHub context

[16:40:40 - 16:40:45]
here it's a private link so I don't know

[16:40:43 - 16:40:47]
I could share this publicly I think that

[16:40:45 - 16:40:49]
if you're doing this for real you should

[16:40:47 - 16:40:50]
just try to generate it out and lovable

[16:40:49 - 16:40:52]
and try to replicate it so in this case

[16:40:50 - 16:40:53]
I don't think I'll provide you the code

[16:40:52 - 16:40:56]
as uh I think that's that's just better

[16:40:53 - 16:40:59]
for your learning experience um but yeah

[16:40:56 - 16:41:02]
there you go that's lovable Chia

[16:40:59 - 16:41:05]
[Music]

[16:41:02 - 16:41:06]
Chow hey this is Andrew Brown this video

[16:41:05 - 16:41:08]
we're going to take a look at fast HTML

[16:41:06 - 16:41:09]
which is used for building modern

[16:41:08 - 16:41:11]
applications in pure python I believe

[16:41:09 - 16:41:13]
that it handles both the front end and

[16:41:11 - 16:41:15]
the back end whereas something like uh

[16:41:13 - 16:41:17]
fast API is only back end I don't think

[16:41:15 - 16:41:20]
the projects are related but this could

[16:41:17 - 16:41:22]
be something considered similar to um

[16:41:20 - 16:41:26]
you know something that is like gradio

[16:41:22 - 16:41:28]
or stream but more a bit more polished

[16:41:26 - 16:41:29]
um but anyway we'll go take a look here

[16:41:28 - 16:41:31]
and see what we can learn I'm going just

[16:41:29 - 16:41:32]
open this up in a new tab I'm going to

[16:41:31 - 16:41:35]
make my way over to our GitHub

[16:41:32 - 16:41:37]
repository to the geni essentials I'm

[16:41:35 - 16:41:38]
going to open up a new environment here

[16:41:37 - 16:41:40]
in GitHub code spaces looks like I have

[16:41:38 - 16:41:42]
one for before I'm just going to go

[16:41:40 - 16:41:44]
ahead and delete that as we will start

[16:41:42 - 16:41:45]
from scratch sometimes I use git pod

[16:41:44 - 16:41:47]
sometimes I use codespaces sometimes I

[16:41:45 - 16:41:49]
use local developer environments I'm all

[16:41:47 - 16:41:51]
over the place here because I want you

[16:41:49 - 16:41:53]
to be comfortable anywhere you're

[16:41:51 - 16:41:56]
working um so you should learn a little

[16:41:53 - 16:41:58]
bit of everywhere okay so we're going to

[16:41:56 - 16:42:00]
start this environment up as that's

[16:41:58 - 16:42:03]
loading let's go take a look at fast

[16:42:00 - 16:42:05]
HTML um so fast HTML is a new way to

[16:42:03 - 16:42:07]
create modern interactive web apps it

[16:42:05 - 16:42:10]
scales to six lines of python it scales

[16:42:07 - 16:42:13]
up to complex product applications with

[16:42:10 - 16:42:16]
off DB caching styling and more so this

[16:42:13 - 16:42:17]
sounds more like a fullon framework

[16:42:16 - 16:42:20]
whereas the other ones are a little bit

[16:42:17 - 16:42:21]
more uh lighter um but it also sounds

[16:42:20 - 16:42:23]
like you can start with the minimal

[16:42:21 - 16:42:25]
amount of code to get going

[16:42:23 - 16:42:27]
so let's go over to our components and

[16:42:25 - 16:42:28]
what I'm just trying to do is figure out

[16:42:27 - 16:42:29]
the documentation maybe docs would be

[16:42:28 - 16:42:31]
probably

[16:42:29 - 16:42:33]
better

[16:42:31 - 16:42:36]
okay and so it looks like we're going to

[16:42:33 - 16:42:37]
do a python fast HTML and here is a

[16:42:36 - 16:42:40]
minimal app that we can get started with

[16:42:37 - 16:42:42]
so let's go ahead and give that a go I

[16:42:40 - 16:42:43]
want to have a theme that is a bit

[16:42:42 - 16:42:46]
easier on the eyes so I'm going to go

[16:42:43 - 16:42:48]
with a dark theme Here I do not think I

[16:42:46 - 16:42:51]
chose a dark theme so I will try one

[16:42:48 - 16:42:53]
more time here to change my

[16:42:51 - 16:42:56]
theme um it's a little unresponsive but

[16:42:53 - 16:42:58]
I think it's just thinking maybe there

[16:42:56 - 16:42:58]
we

[16:42:58 - 16:43:03]
go there we are so that's a little bit

[16:43:00 - 16:43:04]
better we'll bump up the font here I'm

[16:43:03 - 16:43:06]
going to make a new folder over here

[16:43:04 - 16:43:08]
called we'll say allow here but we'll

[16:43:06 - 16:43:12]
call it fast HTML and I know a lot of

[16:43:08 - 16:43:13]
folks like Fast HTML um but uh you know

[16:43:12 - 16:43:15]
again I just don't have tons of

[16:43:13 - 16:43:17]
experience with it but we're going to

[16:43:15 - 16:43:20]
get to it here I mean for me all

[16:43:17 - 16:43:22]
Frameworks are basically the same uh so

[16:43:20 - 16:43:23]
you know I don't I don't find one better

[16:43:22 - 16:43:26]
than the other at this point it's all

[16:43:23 - 16:43:28]
the same to me but you know us exploring

[16:43:26 - 16:43:30]
these is good because then you can

[16:43:28 - 16:43:32]
choose what what best works for you

[16:43:30 - 16:43:34]
anyway so uh here we have a minimal

[16:43:32 - 16:43:35]
example and so I'm going to go ahead and

[16:43:34 - 16:43:38]
copy

[16:43:35 - 16:43:39]
this and we'll go back over to here and

[16:43:38 - 16:43:40]
make a new file this one's going to call

[16:43:39 - 16:43:42]
be called

[16:43:40 - 16:43:44]
main.py I'm going to go ahead and paste

[16:43:42 - 16:43:46]
in main.py and let's take a look at what

[16:43:44 - 16:43:48]
we have so

[16:43:46 - 16:43:51]
far all right and yeah we'll install the

[16:43:48 - 16:43:54]
python extension why not so we have a

[16:43:51 - 16:43:56]
fast HTML common that we're importing

[16:43:54 - 16:43:58]
here it's initializing the fast app we

[16:43:56 - 16:44:02]
have app and RT I'm not sure what RT is

[16:43:58 - 16:44:04]
for as of yet but here we have uh get

[16:44:02 - 16:44:06]
and inside of that we have a hello world

[16:44:04 - 16:44:07]
and you can see it has like this div so

[16:44:06 - 16:44:13]
it's going to render a div called hello

[16:44:07 - 16:44:15]
world we have X HX get for change so I'm

[16:44:13 - 16:44:17]
assuming maybe that is not actually not

[16:44:15 - 16:44:19]
sure what that is but the point is is

[16:44:17 - 16:44:20]
that will this work what I'm confused

[16:44:19 - 16:44:22]
about is like where does the serve come

[16:44:20 - 16:44:23]
from maybe when we do this Mass import

[16:44:22 - 16:44:25]
that's where it's coming from that's

[16:44:23 - 16:44:28]
probably what the case is I'm going to

[16:44:25 - 16:44:30]
do a I'm going to CD into fast HTML and

[16:44:28 - 16:44:33]
we'll do a pip install hyphen R

[16:44:30 - 16:44:36]
requirements.txt

[16:44:33 - 16:44:37]
okay and I think for that to work I have

[16:44:36 - 16:44:39]
to probably type it correctly so let me

[16:44:37 - 16:44:42]
just autocomplete that and so that's

[16:44:39 - 16:44:43]
going to go ahead and install uh that

[16:44:42 - 16:44:48]
let's go and see if we can get this

[16:44:43 - 16:44:48]
running so say python app or

[16:44:49 - 16:44:54]
main. okay we'll give it a moment here

[16:44:51 - 16:44:57]
to start it started on

[16:44:54 - 16:45:01]
5001 and we'll go

[16:44:57 - 16:45:03]
ahead and open that in the browser

[16:45:01 - 16:45:07]
here and we have ourselves a hello world

[16:45:03 - 16:45:10]
so a very basic start to it um feels

[16:45:07 - 16:45:12]
kind of like a ruby Sinatra to me to be

[16:45:10 - 16:45:13]
honest but let's scroll on down here and

[16:45:12 - 16:45:14]
see what else there is so we have

[16:45:13 - 16:45:16]
running the app will'll print out the

[16:45:14 - 16:45:17]
following adding interactive

[16:45:16 - 16:45:20]
interactivity surprisingly easily thanks

[16:45:17 - 16:45:23]
to HTML HTM

[16:45:20 - 16:45:24]
X okay so modify the file to add this

[16:45:23 - 16:45:26]
function all right let's go ahead and

[16:45:24 - 16:45:26]
give that a

[16:45:28 - 16:45:33]
try and oh it's literally a single line

[16:45:32 - 16:45:35]
so weird to have that as a single line

[16:45:33 - 16:45:36]
I'm not sure if I feel comfortable doing

[16:45:35 - 16:45:37]
that so I'm going to bring it down to a

[16:45:36 - 16:45:40]
new

[16:45:37 - 16:45:42]
line okay and uh we'll go back over to

[16:45:40 - 16:45:44]
here give this a hard

[16:45:42 - 16:45:47]
refresh okay and all I did was click it

[16:45:44 - 16:45:50]
so I'm just going to refresh this here I

[16:45:47 - 16:45:52]
click it and so it looks like if I click

[16:45:50 - 16:45:54]
that creates an action so that's kind of

[16:45:52 - 16:45:54]
interesting

[16:45:55 - 16:45:58]
now you have a clickable element and the

[16:45:56 - 16:46:01]
page changes when the text is clicked

[16:45:58 - 16:46:02]
okay getting help from an AI so this is

[16:46:01 - 16:46:06]
where it might be interesting where we

[16:46:02 - 16:46:09]
we'll want to use an AI to um augment it

[16:46:06 - 16:46:11]
now I believe that I mean I haven't seen

[16:46:09 - 16:46:12]
this much but um I think this is a cool

[16:46:11 - 16:46:14]
idea where it's like there's a tool out

[16:46:12 - 16:46:16]
there and let's say you have an LM that

[16:46:14 - 16:46:19]
doesn't know anything about how to use

[16:46:16 - 16:46:20]
it well they wrote a big uh knowledge

[16:46:19 - 16:46:22]
based document so you can use something

[16:46:20 - 16:46:25]
to generate out I was trying this

[16:46:22 - 16:46:27]
earlier and I found that I wasn't able

[16:46:25 - 16:46:29]
to attach my my company credit card to

[16:46:27 - 16:46:31]
Claude but because the context is so

[16:46:29 - 16:46:33]
large I feel like you have to use

[16:46:31 - 16:46:35]
something like Claude Sonet um with

[16:46:33 - 16:46:38]
projects to do this it suggests that you

[16:46:35 - 16:46:40]
could use other things but um like it

[16:46:38 - 16:46:42]
says cursor chat gbt Claude copilot

[16:46:40 - 16:46:44]
won't give useful answers about to fix

[16:46:42 - 16:46:47]
that problem provid an LM friendly guide

[16:46:44 - 16:46:50]
that teaches how to use fast HTML so I

[16:46:47 - 16:46:55]
suppose like if we're using

[16:46:50 - 16:46:58]
co-pilot um then we could just drop

[16:46:55 - 16:46:59]
in that code but like I don't know this

[16:46:58 - 16:47:01]
is hard to say I think what I'll do is

[16:46:59 - 16:47:04]
I'll resubscribe with my own credit card

[16:47:01 - 16:47:06]
to uh Claude because again we can't use

[16:47:04 - 16:47:08]
it I'll just show you what I mean if we

[16:47:06 - 16:47:10]
go ahead and try to uh use this document

[16:47:08 - 16:47:12]
I'm pretty sure I download it before so

[16:47:10 - 16:47:15]
I downloaded I renamed it to prompt if I

[16:47:12 - 16:47:18]
was to attempt to upload the file which

[16:47:15 - 16:47:20]
I have let me see here it should be

[16:47:18 - 16:47:22]
downloaded here

[16:47:20 - 16:47:24]
somewhere yeah I have it called prompt.

[16:47:22 - 16:47:26]
txt I'm going to try to import that file

[16:47:24 - 16:47:29]
it's going to say that conversation is

[16:47:26 - 16:47:33]
25% over the length limit so in this

[16:47:29 - 16:47:36]
version I can't use it okay so this is

[16:47:33 - 16:47:37]
with Claude Sonet 3.5 so I think the

[16:47:36 - 16:47:39]
only way I could do this is by upgrading

[16:47:37 - 16:47:40]
my plan so give me a mo I'm going to

[16:47:39 - 16:47:41]
upgrade even though it's really

[16:47:40 - 16:47:43]
expensive for me I'm going to go upgrade

[16:47:41 - 16:47:45]
my plan okay all right so I resubscribed

[16:47:43 - 16:47:46]
to CLA I hope it's worth it but what

[16:47:45 - 16:47:47]
they're talking about is that you can

[16:47:46 - 16:47:49]
create project so if I go here to the

[16:47:47 - 16:47:52]
left hand side I can create a new

[16:47:49 - 16:47:53]
project and I'm going to call this one

[16:47:52 - 16:47:56]
um because I want this to be

[16:47:53 - 16:47:58]
specifically for writing uh fast HTML

[16:47:56 - 16:48:00]
I'm going to say fast HTML I'm going to

[16:47:58 - 16:48:03]
show a version of this with Claude and

[16:48:00 - 16:48:05]
then we'll do chat PT but um if you

[16:48:03 - 16:48:07]
don't have CLA just watch at this point

[16:48:05 - 16:48:09]
and then we'll see what the experiences

[16:48:07 - 16:48:12]
with like chat PT so fast HTML code

[16:48:09 - 16:48:16]
writer is what I'm going to call it

[16:48:12 - 16:48:18]
write uh fast HTML code okay so that's

[16:48:16 - 16:48:21]
what we want this to do we'll go ahead

[16:48:18 - 16:48:25]
and create that project and I want to uh

[16:48:21 - 16:48:27]
bring in that content here so so um what

[16:48:25 - 16:48:29]
I'm going to do is I'm going to go and

[16:48:27 - 16:48:32]
add that and upload

[16:48:29 - 16:48:35]
it so let's just that prompt txt here

[16:48:32 - 16:48:36]
and so now it should now have cont uh

[16:48:35 - 16:48:39]
context of what's going on here it says

[16:48:36 - 16:48:40]
23% knowledge capacity is used so

[16:48:39 - 16:48:43]
obviously the free tier could not handle

[16:48:40 - 16:48:46]
that but now we'll just say read the

[16:48:43 - 16:48:51]
project knowledge read The

[16:48:46 - 16:48:54]
Prompt txt document and just confirm you

[16:48:51 - 16:48:54]
understand it's

[16:48:55 - 16:48:58]
contents okay so hopefully it's not

[16:48:57 - 16:49:00]
going to write tons back to me because

[16:48:58 - 16:49:02]
then that will slow things down but the

[16:49:00 - 16:49:04]
idea here is I want it first to know

[16:49:02 - 16:49:08]
about the prompt document sometimes you

[16:49:04 - 16:49:11]
have to do this for um for these things

[16:49:08 - 16:49:13]
here okay so it's saying that it now

[16:49:11 - 16:49:15]
understands about the document and so

[16:49:13 - 16:49:19]
the next step is to tell it to generate

[16:49:15 - 16:49:23]
some code so I want to use fast HTML to

[16:49:19 - 16:49:28]
generate or to write a

[16:49:23 - 16:49:30]
um chat interface for open AI well I am

[16:49:28 - 16:49:32]
subscribed to Claude but I'd have to put

[16:49:30 - 16:49:33]
some credits on there if I wanted to use

[16:49:32 - 16:49:37]
it but I'll just say I want to use fast

[16:49:33 - 16:49:39]
to write a chat interface for open AI uh

[16:49:37 - 16:49:41]
GPT

[16:49:39 - 16:49:46]
40 uh

[16:49:41 - 16:49:46]
mini can you give me the code for

[16:49:47 - 16:49:52]
that let's see how it does okay I was

[16:49:50 - 16:49:54]
thinking like I could load up Claude but

[16:49:52 - 16:49:57]
i' uh the my company credit card is not

[16:49:54 - 16:49:58]
working here I can't imagine work in um

[16:49:57 - 16:50:01]
a workbench so I might have to do some

[16:49:58 - 16:50:03]
work there to get that stuff hooked up

[16:50:01 - 16:50:04]
all right so that was very quick um I

[16:50:03 - 16:50:06]
didn't even need to pause for that so we

[16:50:04 - 16:50:09]
have some code here is it any good I'm

[16:50:06 - 16:50:10]
not sure we're going to go copy copy the

[16:50:09 - 16:50:15]
contents of the file I'm going to make

[16:50:10 - 16:50:16]
my way back over to here into GitHub

[16:50:15 - 16:50:19]
codes spaces I'm going to make a new

[16:50:16 - 16:50:21]
file here called chat dopy I'm going to

[16:50:19 - 16:50:23]
paste in the contents and let's take a

[16:50:21 - 16:50:25]
look at what we have so I'm going to go

[16:50:23 - 16:50:26]
all the way to the top here and so we're

[16:50:25 - 16:50:28]
importing fast HTML common we're

[16:50:26 - 16:50:32]
importing open aai which is correct we

[16:50:28 - 16:50:34]
are importing OS we are building our app

[16:50:32 - 16:50:36]
here it's saying to set the open API key

[16:50:34 - 16:50:37]
and this is one way that you can do it

[16:50:36 - 16:50:40]
it's not the way that I like to do it

[16:50:37 - 16:50:43]
but it is a way that we can do it um I

[16:50:40 - 16:50:49]
would rather create a EnV

[16:50:43 - 16:50:49]
file okay and I'll just also make a env.

[16:50:49 - 16:50:54]
example and so in here we will just make

[16:50:52 - 16:50:57]
a new. GE ignore

[16:50:54 - 16:51:01]
file get

[16:50:57 - 16:51:04]
ignore and I'm going to ignore the

[16:51:01 - 16:51:06]
umv file we've done this a couple times

[16:51:04 - 16:51:08]
so like with streamlet and other ones so

[16:51:06 - 16:51:10]
I'm going to go over to here and grab my

[16:51:08 - 16:51:12]
example information I'm going to paste

[16:51:10 - 16:51:14]
it into here and then we're going to get

[16:51:12 - 16:51:16]
our real key and place it into here in

[16:51:14 - 16:51:19]
just a moment after we've audited the

[16:51:16 - 16:51:23]
code so uh one thing we did in stream

[16:51:19 - 16:51:25]
litting gradio is that we imported um um

[16:51:23 - 16:51:28]
it as a EnV so we're going to go ahead

[16:51:25 - 16:51:31]
and do that we'll need to

[16:51:28 - 16:51:33]
update the requirements.txt

[16:51:31 - 16:51:35]
we're kind of sharing it with uh two

[16:51:33 - 16:51:36]
other ones here but it's called python.

[16:51:35 - 16:51:37]
EnV I think it's silly that they have to

[16:51:36 - 16:51:40]
put python in front of there but that's

[16:51:37 - 16:51:42]
just how it is um I think we'll also

[16:51:40 - 16:51:45]
need open AI here so I'm going to go

[16:51:42 - 16:51:47]
update that as well open AI

[16:51:45 - 16:51:49]
okay

[16:51:47 - 16:51:51]
um one thing that is a little bit

[16:51:49 - 16:51:55]
different that that I did um differently

[16:51:51 - 16:51:56]
here is how we import open AI so this is

[16:51:55 - 16:51:57]
how we're going to initialize the client

[16:51:56 - 16:51:59]
or this is how I prefer to initialize

[16:51:57 - 16:52:02]
the client going to go ahead and do that

[16:51:59 - 16:52:05]
what's interesting is I don't

[16:52:02 - 16:52:09]
see the client being called anywhere

[16:52:05 - 16:52:10]
here at least not yet so I'm just

[16:52:09 - 16:52:12]
carefully looking through

[16:52:10 - 16:52:15]
here so I see open AI here and it's

[16:52:12 - 16:52:21]
using the old the old information that

[16:52:15 - 16:52:21]
doesn't look new at all so it looks like

[16:52:22 - 16:52:29]
the open AI API you are

[16:52:25 - 16:52:31]
using is old because that's not what it

[16:52:29 - 16:52:31]
looks like

[16:52:31 - 16:52:37]
now let's see if it can figure out

[16:52:33 - 16:52:40]
what's wrong here definitely is

[16:52:37 - 16:52:42]
incorrect okay and then we'll go down

[16:52:40 - 16:52:44]
and let's go take a look

[16:52:42 - 16:52:49]
here

[16:52:44 - 16:52:51]
okay it's not using GPT 40

[16:52:49 - 16:52:54]
mini let's tell that maybe he doesn't

[16:52:51 - 16:52:54]
know about it

[16:52:58 - 16:53:02]
it's interesting that I'm paying for

[16:52:59 - 16:53:04]
this and it's wrong I don't know it's a

[16:53:02 - 16:53:06]
bit frustrating but it's saying gp4

[16:53:04 - 16:53:08]
that's not that's still not right but

[16:53:06 - 16:53:10]
that's okay so I'm going to go ahead and

[16:53:08 - 16:53:13]
just copy this part of the

[16:53:10 - 16:53:14]
content I don't feel like uh replacing

[16:53:13 - 16:53:15]
the the top part here so I just don't

[16:53:14 - 16:53:18]
want to have problems with that so we'll

[16:53:15 - 16:53:20]
go back over to our file here I'm going

[16:53:18 - 16:53:21]
to go and grab this and it's not

[16:53:20 - 16:53:23]
producing the latest code it's a bit

[16:53:21 - 16:53:25]
frustrating so we'll go ahead and paste

[16:53:23 - 16:53:27]
it in here as such but that's okay

[16:53:25 - 16:53:29]
because we have our own over here on the

[16:53:27 - 16:53:32]
left hand side so we'll go or right hand

[16:53:29 - 16:53:33]
side so we'll copy this part and I know

[16:53:32 - 16:53:35]
I want to bring this in here I'm not

[16:53:33 - 16:53:37]
sure why it has chat histories now but

[16:53:35 - 16:53:40]
it seemed to have made some revisions

[16:53:37 - 16:53:43]
here um also the Styles have greatly

[16:53:40 - 16:53:46]
reduced again not sure why that changed

[16:53:43 - 16:53:48]
but whatever so we'll go down here and

[16:53:46 - 16:53:53]
the API looks a little bit

[16:53:48 - 16:53:55]
better but we want to use um

[16:53:53 - 16:53:58]
40 mini which is over here so I'm going

[16:53:55 - 16:53:58]
to go ahead and copy

[16:53:59 - 16:54:03]
that I'm not sure if it's going to need

[16:54:01 - 16:54:04]
a Max tokens the other one has Max

[16:54:03 - 16:54:07]
tokens so I'm just going to save myself

[16:54:04 - 16:54:07]
some trouble and bring that

[16:54:09 - 16:54:13]
over okay again not sure if we really

[16:54:11 - 16:54:14]
need it like if it's maybe there's like

[16:54:13 - 16:54:18]
a default I'm not

[16:54:14 - 16:54:20]
sure and I really really hate for space

[16:54:18 - 16:54:22]
indentation but we're going to just live

[16:54:20 - 16:54:24]
with it in this video here um here

[16:54:22 - 16:54:27]
obviously they have like a try around it

[16:54:24 - 16:54:29]
and this one doesn't so I mean it should

[16:54:27 - 16:54:30]
be no surprised that open AI can write

[16:54:29 - 16:54:33]
better or sorry chat GPT can write

[16:54:30 - 16:54:34]
better open AI code as that would be

[16:54:33 - 16:54:36]
expected uh but the question is will

[16:54:34 - 16:54:39]
this work right so here we have the div

[16:54:36 - 16:54:41]
message user message do have assistant

[16:54:39 - 16:54:44]
and then it has

[16:54:41 - 16:54:46]
CLS I'm not sure what CLS stands for but

[16:54:44 - 16:54:49]
obviously this does something we could

[16:54:46 - 16:54:49]
just look these up

[16:54:49 - 16:54:55]
here oh these are all HTM h X okay a

[16:54:54 - 16:54:57]
turbo allows you to specify that some

[16:54:55 - 16:55:00]
content in a response should be swapped

[16:54:57 - 16:55:02]
into the Dom somewhere else out of band

[16:55:00 - 16:55:05]
okay so that'd be really interesting to

[16:55:02 - 16:55:07]
see if this works

[16:55:05 - 16:55:09]
um but to me like the code just doesn't

[16:55:07 - 16:55:12]
look very good so I'm not confident

[16:55:09 - 16:55:14]
about the code that's here but that's

[16:55:12 - 16:55:16]
okay we're going to make our way over to

[16:55:14 - 16:55:16]
uh open

[16:55:16 - 16:55:24]
aai and we're going to go

[16:55:20 - 16:55:24]
over here to the the

[16:55:26 - 16:55:29]
um the

[16:55:30 - 16:55:36]
login and nope that's not what I wanted

[16:55:33 - 16:55:36]
I want to get over

[16:55:39 - 16:55:45]
to the API

[16:55:42 - 16:55:47]
login and so from here I need to

[16:55:45 - 16:55:49]
generate out a new

[16:55:47 - 16:55:50]
token I actually already have a project

[16:55:49 - 16:55:51]
called Fast HTML I must have created it

[16:55:50 - 16:55:54]
earlier if you don't have you just go

[16:55:51 - 16:55:55]
create one there it's not a big deal

[16:55:54 - 16:55:57]
then once we have our project we're

[16:55:55 - 16:56:00]
going to manage our projects I'm going

[16:55:57 - 16:56:01]
to go over to oh show me projects here

[16:56:00 - 16:56:03]
we go so I've already created this

[16:56:01 - 16:56:05]
project before just go create it and

[16:56:03 - 16:56:07]
name it if you don't have an open AI

[16:56:05 - 16:56:09]
account go create one they have a free

[16:56:07 - 16:56:11]
tier if you if the free tier is gone

[16:56:09 - 16:56:13]
then you'll just have to watch here but

[16:56:11 - 16:56:15]
we'll learn as we go here so I'm going

[16:56:13 - 16:56:17]
to go ahead and paste this into the

[16:56:15 - 16:56:20]
project here and then the next thing

[16:56:17 - 16:56:24]
we'll do is go over to General I'm going

[16:56:20 - 16:56:24]
to grab my or ID

[16:56:25 - 16:56:30]
and I'm going to paste that in here as

[16:56:27 - 16:56:32]
such and then I need my open API key so

[16:56:30 - 16:56:34]
here I have open API key I've already

[16:56:32 - 16:56:35]
created one previously as you see I made

[16:56:34 - 16:56:38]
one attempt here

[16:56:35 - 16:56:39]
before I think what happened is I forgot

[16:56:38 - 16:56:42]
to unpause the

[16:56:39 - 16:56:45]
video going to call fast HTML fast HTML

[16:56:42 - 16:56:47]
we'll give it all permissions here we

[16:56:45 - 16:56:49]
have our key we'll bring this back over

[16:56:47 - 16:56:52]
up to

[16:56:49 - 16:56:53]
here we'll paste it in save it I'm going

[16:56:52 - 16:56:55]
to scroll up here we're going to go to

[16:56:53 - 16:56:58]
over the terminal I'm going to stop the

[16:56:55 - 16:57:01]
server we need to do another pip install

[16:56:58 - 16:57:03]
our requirements and so this is all set

[16:57:01 - 16:57:06]
up whether it works as a different

[16:57:03 - 16:57:09]
story so do python

[16:57:06 - 16:57:10]
main.py so I thought maybe like fast htl

[16:57:09 - 16:57:14]
would have some kind of more Magic on

[16:57:10 - 16:57:16]
the front end but it's just using um HTM

[16:57:14 - 16:57:18]
X okay so here it has hello world I

[16:57:16 - 16:57:19]
think the reason why it's doing that is

[16:57:18 - 16:57:21]
because I did not specify chat so we're

[16:57:19 - 16:57:24]
going to go here and change this over to

[16:57:21 - 16:57:26]
chat let's see if this loads nope we

[16:57:24 - 16:57:28]
have an issue here did you mean open AI

[16:57:26 - 16:57:33]
let's go take a look at our code

[16:57:28 - 16:57:36]
here um I think our import's

[16:57:33 - 16:57:38]
incorrect so I'm looking at our previous

[16:57:36 - 16:57:42]
example from

[16:57:38 - 16:57:42]
streamlet and we'll paste that in as

[16:57:45 - 16:57:49]
such now we don't have any errors it's

[16:57:47 - 16:57:52]
opening on Port

[16:57:49 - 16:57:53]
5001 so

[16:57:52 - 16:57:57]
it's weird that like this is a text

[16:57:53 - 16:57:58]
field but we'll go down here so hello um

[16:57:57 - 16:58:04]
can

[16:57:58 - 16:58:08]
you hello uh can you teach uh teach me

[16:58:04 - 16:58:10]
top 10 Japanese verbs let's see if that

[16:58:08 - 16:58:11]
works here we're going to go ahead and

[16:58:10 - 16:58:14]
and

[16:58:11 - 16:58:16]
send and I see nothing working here I'm

[16:58:14 - 16:58:18]
going to go down below it looks like I

[16:58:16 - 16:58:20]
got it came back okay so I just was

[16:58:18 - 16:58:22]
impatient there and it actually did work

[16:58:20 - 16:58:23]
this is kind of I guess this is fine I

[16:58:22 - 16:58:25]
thought for some for some reason I could

[16:58:23 - 16:58:28]
like type in text in here but I guess

[16:58:25 - 16:58:30]
not of course here here are the most

[16:58:28 - 16:58:32]
used verbs along with their meanings and

[16:58:30 - 16:58:36]
examples one thing I might want to do is

[16:58:32 - 16:58:38]
like uh you know is there a way depends

[16:58:36 - 16:58:39]
if that actually comes back is markdown

[16:58:38 - 16:58:41]
does this come back as markdown let me

[16:58:39 - 16:58:46]
go back here and take a

[16:58:41 - 16:58:47]
look uh is there a way we can format the

[16:58:46 - 16:58:52]
messages as

[16:58:47 - 16:58:54]
markdown can you just change uh show me

[16:58:52 - 16:58:56]
the Cod

[16:58:54 - 16:58:58]
changes let's see if we can do that that

[16:58:56 - 16:58:58]
might be interesting to

[16:58:59 - 16:59:05]
see yeah that price Point's

[16:59:02 - 16:59:07]
hard okay so here we're importing

[16:59:05 - 16:59:10]
markdown so that's the first thing that

[16:59:07 - 16:59:10]
we will try to bring in

[16:59:10 - 16:59:18]
here okay so we'll do

[16:59:13 - 16:59:18]
that the next thing is

[16:59:19 - 16:59:22]
[Music]

[16:59:26 - 16:59:29]
okay that's fine so we'll scroll down

[16:59:28 - 16:59:32]
here so we have format the message I'm

[16:59:29 - 16:59:32]
going to go ahead and copy this

[16:59:39 - 16:59:46]
in we're going to take a look here

[16:59:42 - 16:59:46]
carefully so what I'm looking

[16:59:47 - 16:59:52]
for there any changes it didn't really

[16:59:50 - 16:59:54]
highlight the changes as I was asking it

[16:59:52 - 16:59:54]
to

[16:59:55 - 17:00:00]
do I'm just carefully looking here like

[16:59:58 - 17:00:02]
beforehand or any that stuff has changed

[17:00:00 - 17:00:05]
there's clearly more styling so I'm

[17:00:02 - 17:00:05]
going to go ahead and grab

[17:00:10 - 17:00:16]
that the next thing is we have this post

[17:00:13 - 17:00:20]
let me just carefully look through

[17:00:16 - 17:00:20]
this so the session looks the

[17:00:20 - 17:00:27]
same h

[17:00:23 - 17:00:27]
this is obviously wrong but

[17:00:28 - 17:00:34]
um the only thing I see changes the

[17:00:30 - 17:00:35]
styles to be honest message pre message

[17:00:34 - 17:00:38]
code user message there must be

[17:00:35 - 17:00:38]
something different

[17:00:41 - 17:00:45]
here format message okay so this is a

[17:00:43 - 17:00:50]
bit different so we'll go ahead and copy

[17:00:45 - 17:00:50]
this we'll go back over to here

[17:00:52 - 17:00:56]
I see

[17:00:54 - 17:00:58]
okay I'm G to make our way back over to

[17:00:56 - 17:01:00]
our user interface we'll give this a

[17:00:58 - 17:01:02]
refresh I'm not sure if that would

[17:01:00 - 17:01:03]
persist the previous

[17:01:02 - 17:01:06]
messages but we'll give this a hard

[17:01:03 - 17:01:06]
refresh and see what

[17:01:06 - 17:01:11]
happens no module name markdown fair

[17:01:09 - 17:01:13]
enough so we'll just stop this we'll go

[17:01:11 - 17:01:15]
ahead and install markdown I'm assuming

[17:01:13 - 17:01:18]
it's just called markdown hopefully and

[17:01:15 - 17:01:18]
we'll do pip install

[17:01:19 - 17:01:22]
hyphen requirements.txt

[17:01:23 - 17:01:27]
and then we'll go back and run this

[17:01:25 - 17:01:32]
hopefully that's the right version of

[17:01:27 - 17:01:32]
markdown it didn't tell us which one

[17:01:32 - 17:01:42]
so can you teach me the top 10 Japanese

[17:01:37 - 17:01:42]
verbs around cooking how about

[17:01:42 - 17:01:47]
that we'll give that a go here and this

[17:01:45 - 17:01:49]
time we just have to be a bit patient

[17:01:47 - 17:01:50]
when I tried this the other day uh with

[17:01:49 - 17:01:52]
Chachi PT it actually tried to do

[17:01:50 - 17:01:54]
streaming which was very impressive

[17:01:52 - 17:01:56]
um though I never got a chance to run

[17:01:54 - 17:01:56]
the

[17:01:56 - 17:02:00]
code so again just patiently waiting

[17:01:59 - 17:02:01]
here it seems like there's probably a

[17:02:00 - 17:02:04]
problem I don't think it should take

[17:02:01 - 17:02:06]
that long yeah we have an error beam

[17:02:04 - 17:02:10]
returned

[17:02:06 - 17:02:10]
back air for chat

[17:02:11 - 17:02:15]
[Music]

[17:02:12 - 17:02:17]
ID maybe we changed some of our code

[17:02:15 - 17:02:20]
let's take a look

[17:02:17 - 17:02:23]
here I mean I didn't change

[17:02:20 - 17:02:26]
anything that should affect

[17:02:23 - 17:02:29]
that line

[17:02:26 - 17:02:32]
52 here CU it does have a session going

[17:02:29 - 17:02:32]
on

[17:02:33 - 17:02:38]
here so I think this might be an issue

[17:02:35 - 17:02:39]
of us running it a second time and

[17:02:38 - 17:02:40]
there's not necessarily anything wrong

[17:02:39 - 17:02:44]
with our

[17:02:40 - 17:02:48]
code um so I'm trying to decide like how

[17:02:44 - 17:02:48]
would I fix this

[17:02:52 - 17:02:56]
well maybe it can CLA just fix it for us

[17:02:55 - 17:02:58]
like I was thinking like I got to clear

[17:02:56 - 17:03:00]
up my cookies I really don't want to do

[17:02:58 - 17:03:02]
that because the sessions probably

[17:03:00 - 17:03:05]
stored cookie side let's see if it gives

[17:03:02 - 17:03:09]
me an answer

[17:03:05 - 17:03:09]
here before initializing

[17:03:10 - 17:03:16]
it okay so it seem like it just changed

[17:03:12 - 17:03:16]
a little bit up here

[17:03:24 - 17:03:28]
okay and we'll go back over to

[17:03:32 - 17:03:39]
here now is that the

[17:03:35 - 17:03:39]
same let me go back and take a

[17:03:39 - 17:03:44]
look I'm just going to copy this one

[17:03:41 - 17:03:48]
more time I don't trust my copy

[17:03:44 - 17:03:48]
job and we'll do that to

[17:03:49 - 17:03:55]
here okay edit saved I'm just going to

[17:03:52 - 17:03:55]
refresh here let's give this a hard

[17:03:56 - 17:04:03]
refresh can you teach me the top 10

[17:03:59 - 17:04:06]
verbs for uh top 10 Japanese

[17:04:03 - 17:04:10]
verbs for

[17:04:06 - 17:04:10]
gardening let's see what we get

[17:04:11 - 17:04:15]
here oh there we go it came back and

[17:04:13 - 17:04:16]
it's formatted so we

[17:04:15 - 17:04:19]
have

[17:04:16 - 17:04:22]
U

[17:04:19 - 17:04:24]
Mizu so that kind of looks like to sit

[17:04:22 - 17:04:30]
but I think it's

[17:04:24 - 17:04:33]
saru yasuru yasu sentu okay Sentai

[17:04:30 - 17:04:34]
that's a that's a fun one to say Sentai

[17:04:33 - 17:04:38]
suru

[17:04:34 - 17:04:41]
um Mizu o yaru that's easy as well okay

[17:04:38 - 17:04:42]
so this is working um now the question

[17:04:41 - 17:04:45]
is what would this experience be with

[17:04:42 - 17:04:47]
chat PT I think it's worth exploring

[17:04:45 - 17:04:49]
just because they gave us that document

[17:04:47 - 17:04:51]
so I'm going to go over to chat PT I'm

[17:04:49 - 17:04:53]
going to go back to our uh file here I'm

[17:04:51 - 17:04:55]
going to rename this

[17:04:53 - 17:04:59]
um like

[17:04:55 - 17:05:01]
Claude we're still going to use um chat

[17:04:59 - 17:05:04]
gbt just to make our lives really easy

[17:05:01 - 17:05:08]
here or like sorry open AI but this will

[17:05:04 - 17:05:11]
be chat GPT example and so I have a paid

[17:05:08 - 17:05:11]
version of chat

[17:05:12 - 17:05:18]
GPT

[17:05:14 - 17:05:23]
and there's o1 which has more advanced

[17:05:18 - 17:05:23]
reasoning but I can't attach

[17:05:24 - 17:05:30]
files so I don't think I can so I have

[17:05:28 - 17:05:32]
01 search is

[17:05:30 - 17:05:35]
unavailable okay

[17:05:32 - 17:05:38]
so I'm going to see if I can

[17:05:35 - 17:05:40]
attach that

[17:05:38 - 17:05:42]
file but when I go to my uploads I can't

[17:05:40 - 17:05:45]
upload it because you can only upload

[17:05:42 - 17:05:48]
like images here if I go to 40 I wonder

[17:05:45 - 17:05:48]
if it can take a

[17:05:49 - 17:05:54]
document it can Okay so

[17:05:52 - 17:05:56]
GPT 40 can take it I mean 01 would be a

[17:05:54 - 17:05:57]
lot better because as reasoning but if I

[17:05:56 - 17:05:59]
want to get that document in here this

[17:05:57 - 17:06:02]
might be the best way to do it when I

[17:05:59 - 17:06:06]
did this before I wasn't actually able

[17:06:02 - 17:06:11]
um uh read The

[17:06:06 - 17:06:13]
Prompt txt so you understand how to work

[17:06:11 - 17:06:16]
with fast HTML I almost kind of wonder

[17:06:13 - 17:06:19]
if like the because 01 can go out to the

[17:06:16 - 17:06:20]
internet then maybe it doesn't even need

[17:06:19 - 17:06:23]
the um it could just fetch the dock

[17:06:20 - 17:06:24]
itself that way way but I can go back

[17:06:23 - 17:06:26]
over to here let's use basically the

[17:06:24 - 17:06:31]
same

[17:06:26 - 17:06:31]
prompt uh it's very similar

[17:06:33 - 17:06:40]
so we'll go back over to chat GPT

[17:06:36 - 17:06:44]
here I would prefer to use o1 but

[17:06:40 - 17:06:44]
whatever we'll see what happens

[17:06:46 - 17:06:51]
here we'll just give it a moment

[17:06:56 - 17:07:01]
it's definitely different he using

[17:06:59 - 17:07:03]
websockets which is actually really cool

[17:07:01 - 17:07:06]
this is what I said before where when I

[17:07:03 - 17:07:10]
used it it was telling me

[17:07:06 - 17:07:10]
websockets so I like that

[17:07:11 - 17:07:16]
um where's the GPT 40 minion here let me

[17:07:13 - 17:07:16]
take a look

[17:07:16 - 17:07:21]
here okay but there's no GPT 40 mini

[17:07:19 - 17:07:25]
code

[17:07:21 - 17:07:29]
where's the gp4 where's the open AI code

[17:07:25 - 17:07:29]
to actually work with the

[17:07:31 - 17:07:35]
model and again I think o1 would do a

[17:07:33 - 17:07:37]
lot better but because we can't upload a

[17:07:35 - 17:07:38]
file we could dump the the contents of

[17:07:37 - 17:07:41]
the file in01 I've done that before but

[17:07:38 - 17:07:41]
I really don't like doing

[17:07:45 - 17:07:52]
that it looks like it's already starting

[17:07:47 - 17:07:52]
to use the old one yep

[17:07:53 - 17:07:56]
so I'm not really impressed by that let

[17:07:55 - 17:07:59]
me see if I

[17:07:56 - 17:08:02]
can can I switch to my other

[17:07:59 - 17:08:03]
model let me just click here new I'm

[17:08:02 - 17:08:05]
going to go to advance re reasoning

[17:08:03 - 17:08:06]
because it's not really performing how I

[17:08:05 - 17:08:10]
want it to perform now I can't attach

[17:08:06 - 17:08:12]
the file but I can copy its contents

[17:08:10 - 17:08:16]
into there so I'm going to go and open

[17:08:12 - 17:08:21]
that file quickly just a

[17:08:16 - 17:08:21]
moment just give me one second

[17:08:21 - 17:08:28]
so now I've opened up the

[17:08:24 - 17:08:28]
file I'm going to copy

[17:08:30 - 17:08:35]
it I'm going to provide

[17:08:33 - 17:08:38]
you a

[17:08:35 - 17:08:44]
body of text so you

[17:08:38 - 17:08:44]
understand how to work with fast

[17:08:44 - 17:08:52]
HTML when you have understood it just

[17:08:48 - 17:08:55]
confirm that you understand it

[17:08:52 - 17:08:57]
in a in a single

[17:08:55 - 17:08:59]
sentence okay if we don't do that it's

[17:08:57 - 17:09:01]
going to outut a lot so now I've pasted

[17:08:59 - 17:09:02]
it and I've basically dumped the whole

[17:09:01 - 17:09:05]
thing in there I don't know this is

[17:09:02 - 17:09:08]
going to work but we'll see what

[17:09:05 - 17:09:10]
happens I feel like it's going to dump a

[17:09:08 - 17:09:11]
lot back oh no it didn't okay excellent

[17:09:10 - 17:09:13]
okay so now I understand how to utilize

[17:09:11 - 17:09:17]
fast HTML decorator based routing okay

[17:09:13 - 17:09:21]
great so now I'm going to go back over

[17:09:17 - 17:09:21]
here and

[17:09:21 - 17:09:27]
I want to use fast HTML chat

[17:09:24 - 17:09:30]
interface it should

[17:09:27 - 17:09:32]
render markdown can you give me the code

[17:09:30 - 17:09:34]
for that let's see if we can do

[17:09:32 - 17:09:36]
it because I I have more faith in 01

[17:09:34 - 17:09:38]
doing a better job but we'll see what

[17:09:36 - 17:09:40]
happens here okay all right so it

[17:09:38 - 17:09:43]
finished generating out some

[17:09:40 - 17:09:46]
code um let's take a look here so open a

[17:09:43 - 17:09:46]
open

[17:09:47 - 17:09:54]
AI code looks fine it's not streaming

[17:09:52 - 17:09:54]
per

[17:09:54 - 17:10:02]
se it's using the old one what the heck

[17:09:58 - 17:10:06]
okay use GPT 40

[17:10:02 - 17:10:09]
mini and use the new

[17:10:06 - 17:10:12]
API okay because it's not I should have

[17:10:09 - 17:10:14]
said open AI open aipi I don't know why

[17:10:12 - 17:10:16]
it does that but it keeps doing that I

[17:10:14 - 17:10:19]
guess just information's a bit

[17:10:16 - 17:10:22]
old but we'll give it a moment here to

[17:10:19 - 17:10:22]
update

[17:10:38 - 17:10:47]
what is it

[17:10:40 - 17:10:47]
doing no no no no what what

[17:11:07 - 17:11:10]
so yeah it's not uh it's not doing a

[17:11:08 - 17:11:11]
good job here but we'll try this again

[17:11:10 - 17:11:13]
it's interesting because like the first

[17:11:11 - 17:11:15]
time I did with um the first time I did

[17:11:13 - 17:11:17]
it the other day I actually got good

[17:11:15 - 17:11:18]
results but there you just get kind of

[17:11:17 - 17:11:21]
random stuff

[17:11:18 - 17:11:23]
here so again we'll see if we uh can get

[17:11:21 - 17:11:23]
me a bit better

[17:11:43 - 17:11:48]
here watching this as it codes

[17:11:54 - 17:11:59]
[Music]

[17:11:56 - 17:12:01]
no okay so I mean we could play with a

[17:11:59 - 17:12:02]
more but clearly it's not doing what we

[17:12:01 - 17:12:05]
ask it to do and we could tweak it to

[17:12:02 - 17:12:06]
get it to work but um we obviously

[17:12:05 - 17:12:08]
already saw how we could tweak it

[17:12:06 - 17:12:11]
through Claud so both Claude and chat

[17:12:08 - 17:12:13]
GPT 40 are failing on this task um and

[17:12:11 - 17:12:17]
it's not on the fast HTML part it's on

[17:12:13 - 17:12:19]
the chat GPT part which is or the open

[17:12:17 - 17:12:21]
AI part so I almost kind of feel like if

[17:12:19 - 17:12:23]
I provided an example of

[17:12:21 - 17:12:25]
um some code it would probably do better

[17:12:23 - 17:12:28]
I don't want to do that here today well

[17:12:25 - 17:12:30]
I guess we could so hold on a second you

[17:12:28 - 17:12:31]
know what let's just try it because the

[17:12:30 - 17:12:34]
whole point of it is to see if we can

[17:12:31 - 17:12:38]
get this to work so let's go over

[17:12:34 - 17:12:38]
to um the streamlet code which is

[17:12:40 - 17:12:45]
small okay I'm just going to copy

[17:12:43 - 17:12:48]
this okay still

[17:12:45 - 17:12:52]
wrong here is an

[17:12:48 - 17:12:55]
example of using the correct

[17:12:52 - 17:12:57]
model and uh open

[17:12:55 - 17:12:59]
AI

[17:12:57 - 17:13:03]
API with

[17:12:59 - 17:13:07]
streamit can you learn from that and fix

[17:13:03 - 17:13:07]
the code for the fast

[17:13:10 - 17:13:13]
HTML okay we'll go ahead and paste that

[17:13:12 - 17:13:16]
in

[17:13:13 - 17:13:17]
there I almost think a121 might be good

[17:13:16 - 17:13:19]
at this because they have very large

[17:13:17 - 17:13:22]
contacts and they might be able to do a

[17:13:19 - 17:13:27]
better job with this but I'm not sure

[17:13:22 - 17:13:28]
or AI 21 I call it a121 it's AI 21 I

[17:13:27 - 17:13:32]
wonder if it's supposed to be like area

[17:13:28 - 17:13:35]
21 not sure or like Forever

[17:13:32 - 17:13:37]
21 but we'll give this a moment here and

[17:13:35 - 17:13:40]
see like this is like if we have a

[17:13:37 - 17:13:42]
comparable example maybe it can do it Eh

[17:13:40 - 17:13:44]
this one actually has a two column chat

[17:13:42 - 17:13:45]
image image which is what is actually

[17:13:44 - 17:13:47]
kind of probably what I would actually

[17:13:45 - 17:13:49]
want but something that we didn't try

[17:13:47 - 17:13:53]
was like if you have this example here

[17:13:49 - 17:13:53]
can you replicate from this other one

[17:13:57 - 17:14:01]
okay not sure why it's doing it that way

[17:13:58 - 17:14:01]
but that's fine I

[17:14:04 - 17:14:07]
suppose it's substantiating here which

[17:14:06 - 17:14:11]
is

[17:14:07 - 17:14:14]
fine I don't know why it's mocking the

[17:14:11 - 17:14:17]
class there's no reason for it to mock

[17:14:14 - 17:14:17]
the class

[17:14:25 - 17:14:30]
I don't know why it's writing so much

[17:14:27 - 17:14:30]
documentation that's really

[17:14:30 - 17:14:34]
annoying but anyway it's interesting

[17:14:32 - 17:14:36]
that it's coming closer to the solution

[17:14:34 - 17:14:39]
with an existing example so I just

[17:14:36 - 17:14:39]
didn't think about doing that

[17:14:40 - 17:14:44]
before all right so let's go ahead and

[17:14:42 - 17:14:46]
grab this

[17:14:44 - 17:14:49]
here and there's a lot going on here but

[17:14:46 - 17:14:53]
maybe we can make it

[17:14:49 - 17:14:58]
work so we'll go back over to fast HTML

[17:14:53 - 17:15:00]
here and I'm going to paste this into

[17:14:58 - 17:15:04]
here the only thing that doesn't make

[17:15:00 - 17:15:04]
sense here is the open AI definition up

[17:15:08 - 17:15:12]
here if if you truly have like it

[17:15:11 - 17:15:14]
doesn't believe that there is one right

[17:15:12 - 17:15:16]
because it's already made a mistake this

[17:15:14 - 17:15:17]
is something what we learn about um

[17:15:16 - 17:15:18]
these things is that they start to

[17:15:17 - 17:15:21]
double down I'm going to just install

[17:15:18 - 17:15:23]
install the uh viom extension don't

[17:15:21 - 17:15:25]
install this um this is just for me

[17:15:23 - 17:15:28]
because I use the Vim keyboard

[17:15:25 - 17:15:31]
extension to move around really easily

[17:15:28 - 17:15:33]
but it's wrong but it thinks it's not

[17:15:31 - 17:15:36]
wrong and so it's kind of it says here's

[17:15:33 - 17:15:38]
a mock example but it's kind of mocking

[17:15:36 - 17:15:40]
us as if like oh are you sure this thing

[17:15:38 - 17:15:42]
actually

[17:15:40 - 17:15:45]
exists it turn it goes chat completions

[17:15:42 - 17:15:46]
with a Capital C and then create which

[17:15:45 - 17:15:48]
is really

[17:15:46 - 17:15:50]
annoying

[17:15:48 - 17:15:54]
um we'll go down here and so we'll

[17:15:50 - 17:15:55]
delete this part out this looks correct

[17:15:54 - 17:15:57]
that's

[17:15:55 - 17:15:58]
fine uh we'll bring this over a little

[17:15:57 - 17:16:00]
bit

[17:15:58 - 17:16:03]
here this is

[17:16:00 - 17:16:07]
okay this is looking like what we want

[17:16:03 - 17:16:07]
it to be all the apis look correct at a

[17:16:10 - 17:16:14]
glance okay let's see if it

[17:16:14 - 17:16:21]
works python

[17:16:17 - 17:16:21]
app or sorry python

[17:16:22 - 17:16:27]
chat

[17:16:24 - 17:16:27]
um chat

[17:16:30 - 17:16:34]
gbt it says no module

[17:16:35 - 17:16:42]
found chat GPT

[17:16:38 - 17:16:42]
chat did I name something wrong

[17:16:46 - 17:16:51]
here hold on here chat gpg chat oh maybe

[17:16:50 - 17:16:53]
maybe that's something to do with the

[17:16:51 - 17:16:54]
fact that I named it chat chat gbt but

[17:16:53 - 17:16:56]
that's fine we're just going to ignore

[17:16:54 - 17:16:58]
that maybe that doesn't matter I'm going

[17:16:56 - 17:17:01]
to go to Port

[17:16:58 - 17:17:06]
5000 should still be over

[17:17:01 - 17:17:08]
here um okay maybe not no ports are open

[17:17:06 - 17:17:12]
error loading

[17:17:08 - 17:17:14]
asgi I'm not sure what that

[17:17:12 - 17:17:16]
is so maybe just to make this work I'm

[17:17:14 - 17:17:19]
just going to rename this to chat chat

[17:17:16 - 17:17:22]
maybe the naming is throwing it off I'm

[17:17:19 - 17:17:24]
not sure why that would

[17:17:22 - 17:17:27]
we'll just go here and type in

[17:17:24 - 17:17:27]
Python chat.

[17:17:30 - 17:17:37]
py okay so that clearly isn't the

[17:17:32 - 17:17:41]
problem we'll go rename this back to

[17:17:37 - 17:17:41]
um back to chat chat

[17:17:44 - 17:17:49]
GPT error loading asgi so there's

[17:17:47 - 17:17:52]
clearly something it's added in here

[17:17:49 - 17:17:54]
that it doesn't like

[17:17:52 - 17:17:57]
maybe it's how it's calling it at the

[17:17:54 - 17:17:58]
bottom let's compare it with our other

[17:17:57 - 17:18:02]
one for

[17:17:58 - 17:18:04]
Claude so this one's just serve at the

[17:18:02 - 17:18:07]
bottom so I'm going to just change this

[17:18:04 - 17:18:07]
over to

[17:18:08 - 17:18:13]
serve is there actually an app called

[17:18:10 - 17:18:13]
app in

[17:18:13 - 17:18:19]
here there is but this one also has that

[17:18:17 - 17:18:20]
but it just calls serve so it probably

[17:18:19 - 17:18:23]
infers it automatically so I'm going to

[17:18:20 - 17:18:25]
go ahead and try

[17:18:23 - 17:18:27]
this again I'm just guessing I don't

[17:18:25 - 17:18:30]
know this framework but notice we don't

[17:18:27 - 17:18:33]
have a problem so clearly my guess was

[17:18:30 - 17:18:36]
good and we'll go back over to

[17:18:33 - 17:18:39]
here and it's loading we have some style

[17:18:36 - 17:18:44]
issues that's okay the question is does

[17:18:39 - 17:18:46]
it work here so um can you describe in

[17:18:44 - 17:18:49]
one sentence a

[17:18:46 - 17:18:52]
landscape uh a landscape

[17:18:49 - 17:18:52]
in in North

[17:18:53 - 17:18:57]
Western

[17:18:55 - 17:18:59]
Ontario and I'm not expecting this to

[17:18:57 - 17:19:01]
work but if it does that'd be really

[17:18:59 - 17:19:04]
awesome we'll be a little bit patient

[17:19:01 - 17:19:04]
here as it's

[17:19:04 - 17:19:11]
thinking we can go back over here and

[17:19:07 - 17:19:11]
looks like they got a 100

[17:19:15 - 17:19:19]
okay and we never got a response P oh no

[17:19:17 - 17:19:22]
there it is

[17:19:19 - 17:19:26]
200 so we get 303 from a post what the

[17:19:22 - 17:19:29]
heck's a 303 303 status code I've never

[17:19:26 - 17:19:31]
seen a 303 before redirections in which

[17:19:29 - 17:19:32]
the server wants the client to use a

[17:19:31 - 17:19:36]
different URL than the requested

[17:19:32 - 17:19:41]
resource okay um so it did not work okay

[17:19:36 - 17:19:42]
so we'll call this done but uh yeah that

[17:19:41 - 17:19:44]
was a little bit disappointing I thought

[17:19:42 - 17:19:47]
I thought it would work better than that

[17:19:44 - 17:19:49]
but I guess we get what we get

[17:19:47 - 17:19:52]
okay so I'm going to go here and just

[17:19:49 - 17:19:52]
add all changes

[17:19:52 - 17:19:58]
and I don't think we

[17:19:55 - 17:19:59]
committed let's go back to this one here

[17:19:58 - 17:20:01]
I just want to make sure I did not

[17:19:59 - 17:20:05]
commit the EnV by

[17:20:01 - 17:20:06]
accident I don't think so so we are fine

[17:20:05 - 17:20:09]
and we'll go push

[17:20:06 - 17:20:10]
that but yeah there you go that's what

[17:20:09 - 17:20:12]
it's like trying to port code from one

[17:20:10 - 17:20:14]
to the other it seems like you there

[17:20:12 - 17:20:17]
probably be a way you can make a model

[17:20:14 - 17:20:20]
like train a model to spe specifically

[17:20:17 - 17:20:21]
do uh porting from one code base to

[17:20:20 - 17:20:23]
another but I feel it have to be an

[17:20:21 - 17:20:24]
expert in both and have good examples

[17:20:23 - 17:20:26]
we'll go over to here we'll get rid of

[17:20:24 - 17:20:29]
our fast HTML API I'm going to go to

[17:20:26 - 17:20:32]
manage projects I'm going to go ahead

[17:20:29 - 17:20:35]
and um delete this project I'm of course

[17:20:32 - 17:20:37]
going to keep um my Claud subscription

[17:20:35 - 17:20:40]
around since I'm sure we'll be utilizing

[17:20:37 - 17:20:40]
in other videos

[17:20:40 - 17:20:45]
here okay I'm just going to Archive that

[17:20:43 - 17:20:48]
and uh yeah that's fast HTML as best as

[17:20:45 - 17:20:49]
we can do and I keep forgetting to do

[17:20:48 - 17:20:52]
this but I'm going to do it in this

[17:20:49 - 17:20:55]
video just so that you know how to do

[17:20:52 - 17:20:56]
this yourself but if we go back to um

[17:20:55 - 17:20:59]
this repository here I'm just going to

[17:20:56 - 17:21:02]
make sure I destroy the GitHub code

[17:20:59 - 17:21:04]
spaces I keep forgetting to do that so

[17:21:02 - 17:21:06]
go ahead and we'll hit delete and I'll

[17:21:04 - 17:21:10]
see you in the next one okay

[17:21:06 - 17:21:12]
[Music]

[17:21:10 - 17:21:14]
ciao let's talk about the active

[17:21:12 - 17:21:16]
sandboxing so sandboxing is when we put

[17:21:14 - 17:21:19]
a piece of our workload within its own

[17:21:16 - 17:21:20]
isolated environment such as a container

[17:21:19 - 17:21:21]
and this is something that we'll

[17:21:20 - 17:21:24]
probably want to do with llms quite a

[17:21:21 - 17:21:26]
bit because llms have the ability to

[17:21:24 - 17:21:28]
exhaust all your resources because they

[17:21:26 - 17:21:30]
use a lot of memory and as a

[17:21:28 - 17:21:33]
conversation continues so does the

[17:21:30 - 17:21:36]
memory uh foot footprint increase they

[17:21:33 - 17:21:38]
can hang they can crash um and uh this

[17:21:36 - 17:21:41]
is not just for LM models this is for AI

[17:21:38 - 17:21:43]
models as well and so we find that

[17:21:41 - 17:21:46]
containers whether that's on kubernetes

[17:21:43 - 17:21:47]
or in Docker containers um or uh

[17:21:46 - 17:21:51]
whatever kind of container format you

[17:21:47 - 17:21:54]
utilize is very useful um to isolate

[17:21:51 - 17:21:56]
these parts of your code from everything

[17:21:54 - 17:21:59]
else um it maybe for smaller startups

[17:21:56 - 17:22:01]
you can get away having everything on uh

[17:21:59 - 17:22:04]
a monolith but uh containers are going

[17:22:01 - 17:22:06]
to come into play quite quickly if you

[17:22:04 - 17:22:08]
are trying to build something that's not

[17:22:06 - 17:22:12]
using man Services

[17:22:08 - 17:22:14]
[Music]

[17:22:12 - 17:22:16]
okay all right let's take a look here at

[17:22:14 - 17:22:18]
OPA which stands for open platform for

[17:22:16 - 17:22:20]
Enterprise and it's a collection of Open

[17:22:18 - 17:22:22]
Source Linux Foundation projects that

[17:22:20 - 17:22:25]
provide blueprints to deploy a workloads

[17:22:22 - 17:22:29]
using containers um and so you can find

[17:22:25 - 17:22:31]
these projects here on github.com at for

[17:22:29 - 17:22:34]
Opa hyphen project and the projects

[17:22:31 - 17:22:37]
we're talking about here is Gen examples

[17:22:34 - 17:22:40]
gen comps J eval gen work Studios and

[17:22:37 - 17:22:42]
there are more but the top two that I

[17:22:40 - 17:22:43]
want to focus on is Gen examples and gen

[17:22:42 - 17:22:46]
comps because those are the most mature

[17:22:43 - 17:22:48]
ones and the ones that I find are the

[17:22:46 - 17:22:50]
most useful um and as the other ones

[17:22:48 - 17:22:50]
mature I think they'll be worth looking

[17:22:50 - 17:22:53]
at

[17:22:50 - 17:22:54]
um but I want to just say with Opa the

[17:22:53 - 17:22:56]
projects are unopinionated templates

[17:22:54 - 17:22:59]
that allow you to deploy in various

[17:22:56 - 17:23:02]
formats whether that is with Docker uh

[17:22:59 - 17:23:04]
uh Docker compose uh kubernetes or onto

[17:23:02 - 17:23:07]
various different Hardwares like Intel

[17:23:04 - 17:23:09]
AMD and Nvidia um but let's just talk

[17:23:07 - 17:23:12]
about gen examples and then gen comp so

[17:23:09 - 17:23:14]
gen examples are a collection of Mega

[17:23:12 - 17:23:17]
services for specific Ai workloads and

[17:23:14 - 17:23:18]
the idea is that they have a bunch here

[17:23:17 - 17:23:20]
and So based on the name you kind of get

[17:23:18 - 17:23:21]
an idea what these workloads could be so

[17:23:20 - 17:23:24]
if you're trying to build something that

[17:23:21 - 17:23:27]
does code generation you could use the

[17:23:24 - 17:23:28]
code gen uh gen example or if you're

[17:23:27 - 17:23:30]
doing translation you could do that or

[17:23:28 - 17:23:32]
if you're doing video Q&A you kind of

[17:23:30 - 17:23:34]
get an idea of what you could utilize

[17:23:32 - 17:23:37]
these for and so the idea is that they

[17:23:34 - 17:23:40]
already have uh um these complex

[17:23:37 - 17:23:42]
workloads set up so if you were trying

[17:23:40 - 17:23:44]
to build out a chatbot with rag you

[17:23:42 - 17:23:46]
could utilize this I'm going to get my

[17:23:44 - 17:23:49]
pen tool out here uh if I can find uh

[17:23:46 - 17:23:52]
the pen here it is okay and so the idea

[17:23:49 - 17:23:54]
here is that you are deploying this

[17:23:52 - 17:23:57]
right and these all contain containers

[17:23:54 - 17:23:59]
so if you are serving a model you use T

[17:23:57 - 17:24:01]
TGI service right but then you might

[17:23:59 - 17:24:04]
have something that sits in front of the

[17:24:01 - 17:24:06]
TGI service um before you send things to

[17:24:04 - 17:24:08]
that service you might want to do

[17:24:06 - 17:24:11]
reranking retrieval embedding these are

[17:24:08 - 17:24:13]
all separate containers some of them

[17:24:11 - 17:24:15]
running um uh llm so if you're doing

[17:24:13 - 17:24:17]
embeddings this would run an llm here

[17:24:15 - 17:24:20]
and obviously the TGI service down here

[17:24:17 - 17:24:21]
would R uh run one okay you might need a

[17:24:20 - 17:24:25]
Vector store so that' be another thing

[17:24:21 - 17:24:26]
with provision you need a front end um

[17:24:25 - 17:24:28]
way to from the front end the back end

[17:24:26 - 17:24:30]
to talk to each other which would be its

[17:24:28 - 17:24:32]
Gateway so there's a lot of moving Parts

[17:24:30 - 17:24:34]
here but the idea is that it's a vanilla

[17:24:32 - 17:24:36]
template so you can go in there and you

[17:24:34 - 17:24:38]
can tweak it to your needs and it comes

[17:24:36 - 17:24:41]
in multiple different configurations

[17:24:38 - 17:24:42]
based on what your use case is um and

[17:24:41 - 17:24:44]
all these components here are generally

[17:24:42 - 17:24:46]
made up of gen comps which are the

[17:24:44 - 17:24:48]
microservices which we'll talk about

[17:24:46 - 17:24:50]
next here I do see the spelling mistake

[17:24:48 - 17:24:52]
I do apologize for that um so Jen comps

[17:24:50 - 17:24:54]
are microservices that you can use as

[17:24:52 - 17:24:56]
the building blocks for your own AI

[17:24:54 - 17:24:58]
workloads a microservice will be

[17:24:56 - 17:24:59]
configured to work in various ways with

[17:24:58 - 17:25:03]
various Technologies and so here is a

[17:24:59 - 17:25:05]
bunch of um uh microservices they have

[17:25:03 - 17:25:07]
so for example on the left hand side of

[17:25:05 - 17:25:08]
highlighted llms and so this is

[17:25:07 - 17:25:12]
something that you put in front of the

[17:25:08 - 17:25:14]
TGI Service uh or VM or whatever is

[17:25:12 - 17:25:16]
serving the model um but here You' go

[17:25:14 - 17:25:18]
and you'd say okay I'm doing text

[17:25:16 - 17:25:21]
generation so I want to go into that

[17:25:18 - 17:25:23]
folder and I want to serve it via TGI um

[17:25:21 - 17:25:25]
and then when you go into there you just

[17:25:23 - 17:25:27]
see a Docker container but the idea is

[17:25:25 - 17:25:29]
that you can see that they have it for

[17:25:27 - 17:25:31]
all these different variant and all of

[17:25:29 - 17:25:34]
these um microservices are like this and

[17:25:31 - 17:25:35]
for the examples it's very similar where

[17:25:34 - 17:25:38]
they have these steps but it's broken

[17:25:35 - 17:25:40]
based down on where you want to deploy

[17:25:38 - 17:25:41]
it and what Hardware you want to use so

[17:25:40 - 17:25:43]
hopefully you see the value in that but

[17:25:41 - 17:25:44]
we will go to a Hands-On lab so we know

[17:25:43 - 17:25:48]
for certain

[17:25:44 - 17:25:50]
[Music]

[17:25:48 - 17:25:51]
okay hey everyone this is ang Brown in

[17:25:50 - 17:25:55]
this video I want to take a look at

[17:25:51 - 17:25:57]
utilizing Opa so um I'm logged to my ad

[17:25:55 - 17:25:59]
account and I figured what we can do is

[17:25:57 - 17:26:01]
we can go ahead and deploy something on

[17:25:59 - 17:26:04]
an ec2 instance now we could do this

[17:26:01 - 17:26:05]
locally but um uh I don't know I just

[17:26:04 - 17:26:06]
think that generally if you're going to

[17:26:05 - 17:26:08]
be using Opa you're going to be putting

[17:26:06 - 17:26:10]
into production and so I want to put it

[17:26:08 - 17:26:11]
somewhere where we can uh go ahead and

[17:26:10 - 17:26:14]
deploy it we probably also do this in

[17:26:11 - 17:26:15]
git pod but again we'll just go ahead

[17:26:14 - 17:26:17]
and do that here so um in the Gen

[17:26:15 - 17:26:18]
Essentials course I don't have the code

[17:26:17 - 17:26:20]
yet but I'm going to go ahead and just

[17:26:18 - 17:26:22]
copy this link because I have built this

[17:26:20 - 17:26:25]
for another workshop and we can bring it

[17:26:22 - 17:26:28]
over and just execute it over here um

[17:26:25 - 17:26:32]
and so this one is called I think

[17:26:28 - 17:26:34]
gen the Gen Training Day workshops and

[17:26:32 - 17:26:37]
in here in my intermediate

[17:26:34 - 17:26:40]
Workshop I have one specifically for Opa

[17:26:37 - 17:26:41]
and what we're looking for in here is

[17:26:40 - 17:26:45]
the OPA sh

[17:26:41 - 17:26:47]
file as this will get us uh mostly set

[17:26:45 - 17:26:49]
up I also have in here a cloud formation

[17:26:47 - 17:26:50]
template which will launch it as well

[17:26:49 - 17:26:52]
but

[17:26:50 - 17:26:54]
um you know I think what we can do is we

[17:26:52 - 17:26:56]
can just go ahead and uh set this up

[17:26:54 - 17:26:58]
manually so I'm going to go ahead and

[17:26:56 - 17:27:00]
just grab this here and I'm going to go

[17:26:58 - 17:27:01]
over to here and we'll make a new

[17:27:00 - 17:27:04]
directory

[17:27:01 - 17:27:07]
here called

[17:27:04 - 17:27:09]
Opa and I'm going to make a new folder

[17:27:07 - 17:27:09]
here called

[17:27:11 - 17:27:19]
basic and I'm going to go ahead and

[17:27:14 - 17:27:20]
just uh create this Opa Dosh file here

[17:27:19 - 17:27:22]
okay and what we'll do is we'll walk

[17:27:20 - 17:27:25]
through this step by step and get this

[17:27:22 - 17:27:28]
all set up okay um so what I'm going to

[17:27:25 - 17:27:30]
want for this is I think like a new

[17:27:28 - 17:27:32]
buntu instance so I'm going to go over

[17:27:30 - 17:27:35]
to well I'm just think about this for a

[17:27:32 - 17:27:37]
second because in this we can run what

[17:27:35 - 17:27:39]
any kind of all we want and I want to

[17:27:37 - 17:27:42]
run this with llama 3.21 bilon instruct

[17:27:39 - 17:27:44]
and for that we need about four uh four

[17:27:42 - 17:27:46]
or um I think four gigabytes of RAM and

[17:27:44 - 17:27:47]
we know that because when we were

[17:27:46 - 17:27:49]
talking to Rola early in the course she

[17:27:47 - 17:27:51]
was talking about or later in the course

[17:27:49 - 17:27:54]
Maybe she was saying that um you know 1

[17:27:51 - 17:27:57]
billion parameters come out to four uh

[17:27:54 - 17:27:59]
four um gigabytes depending on if you're

[17:27:57 - 17:28:02]
using 32 uh float Precision which is

[17:27:59 - 17:28:05]
what this model could have and so four

[17:28:02 - 17:28:07]
four gigabytes of RAM is most likely

[17:28:05 - 17:28:10]
what we'll uh need to utilize um I want

[17:28:07 - 17:28:12]
to deploy this to a Zeon processor I

[17:28:10 - 17:28:15]
think um so I'm going to go take a look

[17:28:12 - 17:28:17]
here and say ec2 Zeon processors and the

[17:28:15 - 17:28:18]
reason I say that is that if we go look

[17:28:17 - 17:28:22]
up

[17:28:18 - 17:28:25]
Opa right and we go into GitHub

[17:28:22 - 17:28:29]
here and we make our way over to the

[17:28:25 - 17:28:32]
repositories and we go into the Gen

[17:28:29 - 17:28:33]
examples and from here we go into uh

[17:28:32 - 17:28:35]
chat Q&A which is what we're going to

[17:28:33 - 17:28:36]
deploy here today uh it's going to have

[17:28:35 - 17:28:37]
different configurations of how we can

[17:28:36 - 17:28:39]
deploy this and so we're going to do

[17:28:37 - 17:28:41]
Docker compos here today but notice it's

[17:28:39 - 17:28:44]
saying like where do you want to deploy

[17:28:41 - 17:28:47]
it you want to deploy it on gpus um onto

[17:28:44 - 17:28:48]
AMD uh Rock M or Intel I'm going to go

[17:28:47 - 17:28:50]
with Intel here and then we have CPUs

[17:28:48 - 17:28:52]
and Gotti I'm going to go to CP pus we

[17:28:50 - 17:28:53]
have aipc which by the way I have we

[17:28:52 - 17:28:57]
could deploy it to that and we'll go to

[17:28:53 - 17:29:00]
Zeon so I generally want to deploy it to

[17:28:57 - 17:29:03]
a um Zeon processor now uh Zeon

[17:29:00 - 17:29:04]
processors are Enterprise level

[17:29:03 - 17:29:06]
processors but if you ever wondered what

[17:29:04 - 17:29:10]
would cost to buy one yourself if I was

[17:29:06 - 17:29:13]
to look up aipc um

[17:29:10 - 17:29:15]
Dell because I actually just bought a

[17:29:13 - 17:29:16]
new computer or my company just bought

[17:29:15 - 17:29:21]
me a new computer and I was trying to

[17:29:16 - 17:29:24]
convince uh boo to let me get a a Dell a

[17:29:21 - 17:29:26]
uh a dell aipc and he just said no you

[17:29:24 - 17:29:27]
don't need one um but I just thought

[17:29:26 - 17:29:29]
it'd be interesting to show that because

[17:29:27 - 17:29:32]
it actually comes with a Zeon processor

[17:29:29 - 17:29:34]
I think it's like Dell AI

[17:29:32 - 17:29:37]
Precision see if I can find it here and

[17:29:34 - 17:29:39]
so if we go over to here let me see if I

[17:29:37 - 17:29:43]
can find

[17:29:39 - 17:29:43]
it um and we go to

[17:29:44 - 17:29:51]
workloads let's go

[17:29:47 - 17:29:52]
desktops Precision fixed workstations

[17:29:51 - 17:29:54]
and Dells are really good computers to

[17:29:52 - 17:29:55]
buy they are a bit expensive but if you

[17:29:54 - 17:29:58]
buy their extended warranties they're

[17:29:55 - 17:30:01]
really really awesome and so we have

[17:29:58 - 17:30:02]
different ones here but I specifically

[17:30:01 - 17:30:05]
want to go to the

[17:30:02 - 17:30:08]
[Music]

[17:30:05 - 17:30:10]
aips go to all workstations here for a

[17:30:08 - 17:30:13]
second here we go and so if we scroll on

[17:30:10 - 17:30:14]
down if we go to the workstations for AI

[17:30:13 - 17:30:16]
so you know if you ever wondered if like

[17:30:14 - 17:30:19]
could you buy yourself a a Zeon

[17:30:16 - 17:30:20]
processor you absolutely could if we go

[17:30:19 - 17:30:21]
down over to here here and we have like

[17:30:20 - 17:30:23]
these Tower work stations there's all

[17:30:21 - 17:30:27]
sorts of kind but if we went to the

[17:30:23 - 17:30:29]
tower like 80 uh 7875 you notice it says

[17:30:27 - 17:30:32]
4,784 it's probably mostly because of

[17:30:29 - 17:30:34]
the GPU but if we go into one and we say

[17:30:32 - 17:30:37]
customize and

[17:30:34 - 17:30:39]
buy um this one's using AMD so it's not

[17:30:37 - 17:30:41]
necessarily what I would like so I'm

[17:30:39 - 17:30:44]
going to go back here as we want one

[17:30:41 - 17:30:47]
that specifically has um Intel and so

[17:30:44 - 17:30:51]
maybe it is

[17:30:47 - 17:30:51]
the it might be this Tower or this Tower

[17:30:52 - 17:30:55]
this product is no longer available so

[17:30:53 - 17:30:58]
then it's going to be the Dell SE uh

[17:30:55 - 17:31:00]
7960 and so if we scroll on down here

[17:30:58 - 17:31:01]
now we can see we have an Intel Zeon

[17:31:00 - 17:31:03]
processor how much this processor cost I

[17:31:01 - 17:31:05]
don't know if we go to this one this is

[17:31:03 - 17:31:09]
$471 so this one

[17:31:05 - 17:31:11]
is how much is it it's a little bit hard

[17:31:09 - 17:31:16]
to tell because it's saying plus and add

[17:31:11 - 17:31:16]
but um uh if we go here that's

[17:31:18 - 17:31:24]
6,000 and I I'm just clicking between

[17:31:22 - 17:31:26]
them yeah so this processor is about I

[17:31:24 - 17:31:29]
don't know $400 $500 but I'm just saying

[17:31:26 - 17:31:32]
like you can get an Intel zon processor

[17:31:29 - 17:31:34]
but the bulk of the cost is really in um

[17:31:32 - 17:31:36]
uh the video card and so this is an AI

[17:31:34 - 17:31:37]
powered PC and I believe that this one

[17:31:36 - 17:31:39]
is set

[17:31:37 - 17:31:43]
to oh is it even set

[17:31:39 - 17:31:46]
yet uh video

[17:31:43 - 17:31:47]
card oh boy maybe that's just the price

[17:31:46 - 17:31:51]
without the video

[17:31:47 - 17:31:53]
card okay but anyway the point is is

[17:31:51 - 17:31:56]
that you can buy an Intel xon 4

[17:31:53 - 17:31:58]
processor uh they also have a fifth

[17:31:56 - 17:31:59]
fifth generation here but just gives you

[17:31:58 - 17:32:00]
kind of an idea of like what it would

[17:31:59 - 17:32:02]
cost if you wanted to have these

[17:32:00 - 17:32:04]
workstations here but I did get a Intel

[17:32:02 - 17:32:06]
machine so that's kind of exciting but

[17:32:04 - 17:32:08]
anyway so and I'm just showing you that

[17:32:06 - 17:32:09]
because you know let's say you are a

[17:32:08 - 17:32:11]
company you could buy one of those

[17:32:09 - 17:32:13]
machines and you could have a very

[17:32:11 - 17:32:16]
proficient machine working in your

[17:32:13 - 17:32:18]
office um uh for for local local

[17:32:16 - 17:32:19]
inference but anyway we're in here as

[17:32:18 - 17:32:21]
you'll notice we have different compos

[17:32:19 - 17:32:24]
files so we have POS pine cone uh

[17:32:21 - 17:32:27]
quadrant VM so if you wanted to serve

[17:32:24 - 17:32:28]
this with VM then you would use this one

[17:32:27 - 17:32:30]
if you wanted to serve it with pine cone

[17:32:28 - 17:32:31]
as your rag you can do that if you want

[17:32:30 - 17:32:33]
it without rag you can do that so you

[17:32:31 - 17:32:34]
can see there's a lot of variants I

[17:32:33 - 17:32:37]
obviously Just Launch it with the most

[17:32:34 - 17:32:39]
basic one um I I actually have a lot of

[17:32:37 - 17:32:41]
trouble uh configuring VM and getting to

[17:32:39 - 17:32:43]
work so if they actually have one here

[17:32:41 - 17:32:45]
that works that is really uh really cool

[17:32:43 - 17:32:46]
um but yeah I've had a lot of trouble

[17:32:45 - 17:32:49]
configuring VMS and so this is the whole

[17:32:46 - 17:32:52]
point of this project to help you get a

[17:32:49 - 17:32:54]
setup that works and then you configure

[17:32:52 - 17:32:57]
uh for yourselves but we want to deploy

[17:32:54 - 17:32:58]
this to a Zeon processor um and so we're

[17:32:57 - 17:33:00]
going to have to find an instance that

[17:32:58 - 17:33:02]
has that so I'm going to say ec2

[17:33:00 - 17:33:05]
instances uh Zeon I'm going to say

[17:33:02 - 17:33:09]
fourth generation processors fourth

[17:33:05 - 17:33:10]
generation and yeah the r7i is the

[17:33:09 - 17:33:13]
models that I believe that we're looking

[17:33:10 - 17:33:16]
for um if you do not have uh the money

[17:33:13 - 17:33:18]
to spend do not run this um but again we

[17:33:16 - 17:33:20]
could run this on an aipc and maybe I

[17:33:18 - 17:33:21]
will attempt to run this afterwards if

[17:33:20 - 17:33:23]
we launch this here I haven't really

[17:33:21 - 17:33:25]
decided but let's go ahead and launch an

[17:33:23 - 17:33:26]
instance it doesn't really cost a lot

[17:33:25 - 17:33:28]
like this should only cost you less than

[17:33:26 - 17:33:30]
a dollar to run but again you know if

[17:33:28 - 17:33:31]
you forget about turning your your Stu

[17:33:30 - 17:33:34]
off you might run into some

[17:33:31 - 17:33:37]
issues so I'm looking for the m7i uh

[17:33:34 - 17:33:40]
generation here so we're going to go I'm

[17:33:37 - 17:33:44]
dropping this down

[17:33:40 - 17:33:47]
here typing m

[17:33:44 - 17:33:47]
s so we have the

[17:33:48 - 17:33:55]
m7a I think stands for yeah for Intel

[17:33:52 - 17:34:00]
and so notice here we have um two vcp

[17:33:55 - 17:34:03]
two vcpus 8 gigabits we have four vcpus

[17:34:00 - 17:34:06]
and 16 gbits we really should run this

[17:34:03 - 17:34:08]
on an i large and notice the cost here

[17:34:06 - 17:34:11]
like if you're running it per

[17:34:08 - 17:34:12]
hour I mean it looks pretty low but I'm

[17:34:11 - 17:34:14]
going to try an ey large I haven't done

[17:34:12 - 17:34:16]
an ey large before I imagine that we can

[17:34:14 - 17:34:18]
do it an i large but it is a little bit

[17:34:16 - 17:34:19]
small I'm going to proceed without key

[17:34:18 - 17:34:22]
pairs I'm going to launch this in my

[17:34:19 - 17:34:24]
default VPC we do need to allow traffic

[17:34:22 - 17:34:26]
from uh the internet so I'm going to

[17:34:24 - 17:34:28]
just checkbox both of these I probably

[17:34:26 - 17:34:29]
only need HTTP but if we want to

[17:34:28 - 17:34:33]
interact with it we're going to have to

[17:34:29 - 17:34:36]
do that um I'm going to drop this down

[17:34:33 - 17:34:38]
here and I have an IM roll that I've

[17:34:36 - 17:34:39]
already created from

[17:34:38 - 17:34:42]
prior

[17:34:39 - 17:34:45]
so we're going to go here and I have one

[17:34:42 - 17:34:47]
called SSS ec2 SSM Ro if you're

[17:34:45 - 17:34:49]
wondering what's in that Ro I'm just

[17:34:47 - 17:34:52]
going to quickly show it there's nothing

[17:34:49 - 17:34:53]
super exciting in here if we go over to

[17:34:52 - 17:34:55]
our

[17:34:53 - 17:34:59]
roles

[17:34:55 - 17:35:00]
um all I've added to that rle if I was

[17:34:59 - 17:35:02]
to make a new Ro and to do this from

[17:35:00 - 17:35:04]
scratch I'd say

[17:35:02 - 17:35:07]
ec2 I'd go next and then I would just

[17:35:04 - 17:35:11]
type in SSM here and it's basically this

[17:35:07 - 17:35:12]
R sometimes it's this one yeah so this

[17:35:11 - 17:35:15]
policy will soon be deprecated so use

[17:35:12 - 17:35:17]
this one instead and so this is the only

[17:35:15 - 17:35:18]
policy I'm attaching to this Ro and

[17:35:17 - 17:35:20]
that's what I'm launching the cc2

[17:35:18 - 17:35:22]
instance with this is so that we can use

[17:35:20 - 17:35:25]
sessions manager so we can easily access

[17:35:22 - 17:35:27]
the um the ec2 instance but anyway so we

[17:35:25 - 17:35:28]
have that uh we have that set I'm going

[17:35:27 - 17:35:30]
to go all the way down to the ground and

[17:35:28 - 17:35:31]
this all looks really good well the only

[17:35:30 - 17:35:34]
thing I'm going to change here is I want

[17:35:31 - 17:35:36]
to go to a bun two Amazon L is fine but

[17:35:34 - 17:35:38]
I just want to make this super easy the

[17:35:36 - 17:35:40]
buntu uh 24 LTS is going to make our

[17:35:38 - 17:35:43]
lives so much easier we'll go ahead and

[17:35:40 - 17:35:44]
launch this instance and again this is

[17:35:43 - 17:35:46]
costing

[17:35:44 - 17:35:48]
pennies or like a dollar or two but if

[17:35:46 - 17:35:50]
you can't afford the dollar don't don't

[17:35:48 - 17:35:52]
run it here and just watch me and I

[17:35:50 - 17:35:54]
might do a video doing this locally but

[17:35:52 - 17:35:56]
the process is basically the same right

[17:35:54 - 17:35:58]
the only the only difference is that you

[17:35:56 - 17:36:00]
would um uh

[17:35:58 - 17:36:03]
utilize

[17:36:00 - 17:36:05]
um the docker compos file from whatever

[17:36:03 - 17:36:07]
whatever folder you want right so but

[17:36:05 - 17:36:08]
anyway we're going to go ahead and get

[17:36:07 - 17:36:09]
this running here I'm going to wait for

[17:36:08 - 17:36:12]
it to initialize and then we're going to

[17:36:09 - 17:36:13]
jump into this machine all right our

[17:36:12 - 17:36:16]
instance is running let's go ahead and

[17:36:13 - 17:36:18]
connect so we'll go here and click

[17:36:16 - 17:36:22]
connect and we'll use sessions manager

[17:36:18 - 17:36:22]
to connect to this

[17:36:22 - 17:36:30]
instance so we'll just give that there a

[17:36:26 - 17:36:34]
moment and what we're going to do is log

[17:36:30 - 17:36:36]
into um the EC user account actually

[17:36:34 - 17:36:39]
sorry this is an auntu machine so we're

[17:36:36 - 17:36:42]
going to be doing pseudo Su H

[17:36:39 - 17:36:43]
Ubuntu so now we can go ahead and

[17:36:42 - 17:36:45]
install this I actually have a full

[17:36:43 - 17:36:47]
automation script and cloud formation

[17:36:45 - 17:36:49]
but I think it helps to uh run through

[17:36:47 - 17:36:51]
this manually I don't know if we need

[17:36:49 - 17:36:55]
the A C in here

[17:36:51 - 17:36:56]
um uh I know that it's set here but I

[17:36:55 - 17:36:58]
don't think we're going to end up using

[17:36:56 - 17:37:00]
it so I'm not sure why we install it

[17:36:58 - 17:37:03]
here let me just do a quick search

[17:37:00 - 17:37:04]
here oh right if we were to store the

[17:37:03 - 17:37:05]
parameter over here but I don't plan on

[17:37:04 - 17:37:08]
doing that here today so I'm just going

[17:37:05 - 17:37:10]
to take this out

[17:37:08 - 17:37:11]
okay and I know it says it's a bass

[17:37:10 - 17:37:12]
script but we're not going to treat it

[17:37:11 - 17:37:14]
as a bass script the first thing we're

[17:37:12 - 17:37:16]
going to do is go ahead and clone the

[17:37:14 - 17:37:19]
Gen examples repo so I'm going to go

[17:37:16 - 17:37:21]
ahead and paste that in here

[17:37:19 - 17:37:22]
and sometimes you get some stuff in the

[17:37:21 - 17:37:23]
front here which you don't want so I'm

[17:37:22 - 17:37:26]
just going to go ahead and clear that

[17:37:23 - 17:37:28]
out so now we are cloning down the Gen

[17:37:26 - 17:37:32]
examples repository we're going to CD

[17:37:28 - 17:37:34]
into the geni examples um uh chat Q&A

[17:37:32 - 17:37:37]
and specifically for that Docker compos

[17:37:34 - 17:37:39]
and here we can see we have some options

[17:37:37 - 17:37:42]
below uh we're going to go ahead and

[17:37:39 - 17:37:43]
install Docker now this is just using

[17:37:42 - 17:37:45]
the instructions that are right off the

[17:37:43 - 17:37:47]
website for Ubuntu so there's nothing uh

[17:37:45 - 17:37:50]
fancy that's going on in here you could

[17:37:47 - 17:37:52]
literally go to the um Ubuntu uh we or

[17:37:50 - 17:37:54]
not the Ubuntu website but the docker

[17:37:52 - 17:37:55]
website and follow the exact same

[17:37:54 - 17:37:58]
instructions but it is really easy just

[17:37:55 - 17:37:59]
to run it here and so once that's done

[17:37:58 - 17:38:02]
installing we're going to want to make

[17:37:59 - 17:38:04]
Docker PUD list I like to make it pseud

[17:38:02 - 17:38:06]
list because it just makes our lives so

[17:38:04 - 17:38:10]
much easier um as I do run into issues

[17:38:06 - 17:38:12]
when running Docker at pseudo um I don't

[17:38:10 - 17:38:14]
run tons of stuff uh at scale in

[17:38:12 - 17:38:15]
containers and production so someone

[17:38:14 - 17:38:17]
might have a different opinion than me

[17:38:15 - 17:38:20]
about running things in pseudo but for

[17:38:17 - 17:38:22]
my workloads I prefer them to be suit

[17:38:20 - 17:38:24]
list for containers so we'll wait for

[17:38:22 - 17:38:27]
that to install it shouldn't take too

[17:38:24 - 17:38:29]
long there we go let's go over to here

[17:38:27 - 17:38:30]
and the next thing we're going to do is

[17:38:29 - 17:38:33]
run these three lines and that's going

[17:38:30 - 17:38:34]
to make Docker sudal list um and so it

[17:38:33 - 17:38:36]
already had a Docker group we'll just

[17:38:34 - 17:38:37]
ignore that that's not a problem so here

[17:38:36 - 17:38:38]
we have some environment variables we

[17:38:37 - 17:38:41]
want to set we're going to want to set

[17:38:38 - 17:38:43]
the hugging face API token I'm going to

[17:38:41 - 17:38:45]
go over uh over there I'm just going to

[17:38:43 - 17:38:48]
adjust this because we can we could

[17:38:45 - 17:38:51]
store this in um sessions manager but

[17:38:48 - 17:38:53]
I'm just going to manually set it here

[17:38:51 - 17:38:56]
okay so set your

[17:38:53 - 17:38:59]
key at this point uh you probably know

[17:38:56 - 17:39:00]
how to uh generate your hugging face API

[17:38:59 - 17:39:03]
key but we'll go ahead and do that as I

[17:39:00 - 17:39:05]
need to generate a new one as per usual

[17:39:03 - 17:39:07]
we'll go down to access tokens I need to

[17:39:05 - 17:39:09]
signing just give me one moment I'm now

[17:39:07 - 17:39:12]
in here I'm going to need a new key I'm

[17:39:09 - 17:39:13]
going to go ahead and delete this one as

[17:39:12 - 17:39:15]
I'm done with mongodb we're going to go

[17:39:13 - 17:39:17]
ahead here and say opa and we're going

[17:39:15 - 17:39:18]
to create ourselves a new token so we're

[17:39:17 - 17:39:21]
going to copy that token I'm going to go

[17:39:18 - 17:39:23]
back over over to here and I'm just

[17:39:21 - 17:39:26]
going to temporarily paste it into here

[17:39:23 - 17:39:28]
I'm going to go ahead and Export

[17:39:26 - 17:39:31]
this okay and I'm going to go ahead and

[17:39:28 - 17:39:33]
hit paste and enter now I don't need

[17:39:31 - 17:39:34]
this key right now so I mean like I

[17:39:33 - 17:39:38]
don't want to commit this to the repo so

[17:39:34 - 17:39:40]
set your set your key so we'll leave

[17:39:38 - 17:39:41]
that alone uh here we can set the host

[17:39:40 - 17:39:43]
IP this honestly just has to be

[17:39:41 - 17:39:46]
something routable to the Internet so

[17:39:43 - 17:39:47]
you could do 0000 z.0 if you wanted to

[17:39:46 - 17:39:51]
or

[17:39:47 - 17:39:52]
1271 I believe um but uh we'll go ahead

[17:39:51 - 17:39:55]
and just paste this here and so this is

[17:39:52 - 17:39:57]
going to set the host IP the next thing

[17:39:55 - 17:39:58]
I'm going to do is just say no proxy so

[17:39:57 - 17:40:02]
you can set this up to work through a

[17:39:58 - 17:40:03]
proxy um but we are directly accessing

[17:40:02 - 17:40:05]
this machine so we do not need to do

[17:40:03 - 17:40:10]
this now we're going to CD into the

[17:40:05 - 17:40:11]
Intel xon CPU uh directory here and

[17:40:10 - 17:40:14]
there's a few other things we need to

[17:40:11 - 17:40:15]
change so there's this do setv file

[17:40:14 - 17:40:17]
where we need to swap it out now you

[17:40:15 - 17:40:19]
could run this line but I think it' just

[17:40:17 - 17:40:22]
be easier to open it up if

[17:40:19 - 17:40:23]
and modify it so what I'm going to do is

[17:40:22 - 17:40:25]
I'm going to just type in clear I'm

[17:40:23 - 17:40:27]
going to type VI and it's called

[17:40:25 - 17:40:28]
setenv.sh and so we have some

[17:40:27 - 17:40:30]
environment variables you need to know

[17:40:28 - 17:40:31]
how to use Vim to do this if you don't

[17:40:30 - 17:40:33]
know how to use Vim make sure you learn

[17:40:31 - 17:40:35]
those keys they're not hard but we here

[17:40:33 - 17:40:38]
we have an embedding model a reranked

[17:40:35 - 17:40:41]
model llm model and uh rag and so for

[17:40:38 - 17:40:43]
rag we're using reddis to store our data

[17:40:41 - 17:40:46]
and so this is set to neural chat 7

[17:40:43 - 17:40:48]
billion parameter version 3 uh three and

[17:40:46 - 17:40:49]
so this thing is kind of large it will

[17:40:48 - 17:40:51]
take forever to download um and it's

[17:40:49 - 17:40:53]
fine but we need something that's going

[17:40:51 - 17:40:56]
to be a little bit smaller and so I want

[17:40:53 - 17:40:58]
to bring in um uh this llama one here so

[17:40:56 - 17:40:59]
I'm just going to type in a manually uh

[17:40:58 - 17:41:01]
well actually I'm not going to type in

[17:40:59 - 17:41:06]
manually I'm going to go look it up and

[17:41:01 - 17:41:09]
in particular we need to utilize um uh

[17:41:06 - 17:41:11]
we need to utilize the instruct version

[17:41:09 - 17:41:13]
of this so uh in order to do this that's

[17:41:11 - 17:41:17]
why we got the hugging face one I'm

[17:41:13 - 17:41:20]
going type in llama 3.2 one billion

[17:41:17 - 17:41:21]
instruct down here

[17:41:20 - 17:41:23]
and notice that I've already granted

[17:41:21 - 17:41:25]
access to the model you need to get

[17:41:23 - 17:41:26]
access to this model to utilize it so

[17:41:25 - 17:41:27]
click through whatever you have to do

[17:41:26 - 17:41:29]
and wait to get access once you have

[17:41:27 - 17:41:31]
access you can utilize this model if you

[17:41:29 - 17:41:32]
do not have access to the model if it

[17:41:31 - 17:41:34]
doesn't say you hav't granted access to

[17:41:32 - 17:41:37]
the model you don't have access to it so

[17:41:34 - 17:41:39]
stare at this page and try to get access

[17:41:37 - 17:41:40]
as best you can here in another video we

[17:41:39 - 17:41:42]
show you how to get model access with a

[17:41:40 - 17:41:44]
hugging face but I found a lot of people

[17:41:42 - 17:41:46]
stumble with this because the UI here is

[17:41:44 - 17:41:49]
just not very clear but over here you

[17:41:46 - 17:41:51]
can see we have the model is about 2.47

[17:41:49 - 17:41:53]
GB and it's a good thing that we use

[17:41:51 - 17:41:55]
that one because the Intel one is just

[17:41:53 - 17:41:57]
giant but what we're looking for here is

[17:41:55 - 17:41:59]
the name so I'm just grabbing this part

[17:41:57 - 17:42:02]
here I'm going to go ahead and copy it

[17:41:59 - 17:42:04]
okay and I'm just going to go ahead and

[17:42:02 - 17:42:08]
try to paste this into place and that

[17:42:04 - 17:42:09]
looks perfect okay and we can use this

[17:42:08 - 17:42:12]
as our embedding model we don't have to

[17:42:09 - 17:42:14]
change it because the embedding is

[17:42:12 - 17:42:16]
really more important for the rag and um

[17:42:14 - 17:42:17]
yeah it's not going to be an issue so

[17:42:16 - 17:42:20]
this is all I wanted to change I'm going

[17:42:17 - 17:42:23]
to do Cole and w q and quit there and so

[17:42:20 - 17:42:25]
that is now set so these lines um this

[17:42:23 - 17:42:27]
basically does the same thing kind of

[17:42:25 - 17:42:28]
except uh this one's a bit inaccurate

[17:42:27 - 17:42:30]
because it's supposed to oh it does it

[17:42:28 - 17:42:32]
swaps out both the lines there perfect

[17:42:30 - 17:42:35]
so you can run this if you want

[17:42:32 - 17:42:36]
um and so now we want to actually run

[17:42:35 - 17:42:39]
this so we'll need to run these two

[17:42:36 - 17:42:41]
lines I'm going to go ahead and copy

[17:42:39 - 17:42:43]
that and we'll go ahead and hit paste

[17:42:41 - 17:42:44]
and hit enter I'm going to make my way

[17:42:43 - 17:42:47]
back over to here and we're going to go

[17:42:44 - 17:42:49]
ahead and copy this line and we'll put

[17:42:47 - 17:42:52]
enter okay and so now what it's doing is

[17:42:49 - 17:42:53]
it's pulling down all these um

[17:42:52 - 17:42:56]
containers so these are all the ones

[17:42:53 - 17:42:59]
that running retriever Tei reranking

[17:42:56 - 17:43:01]
service redus Vector database TGI

[17:42:59 - 17:43:05]
service all this stuff so if we were to

[17:43:01 - 17:43:08]
go over to the OPA

[17:43:05 - 17:43:11]
documentation okay we went over to here

[17:43:08 - 17:43:13]
and we went over to here um and we went

[17:43:11 - 17:43:15]
to go into chat

[17:43:13 - 17:43:16]
Q&A actually you know what I want the

[17:43:15 - 17:43:19]
doc so we'll go to

[17:43:16 - 17:43:21]
op. and if we go over to technical

[17:43:19 - 17:43:22]
documentation on the left hand side

[17:43:21 - 17:43:24]
we'll go into examples and I'm going to

[17:43:22 - 17:43:27]
go to chat Q&A sample we'll go to

[17:43:24 - 17:43:28]
overview okay and so down here we scroll

[17:43:27 - 17:43:30]
on down this is basically what it's

[17:43:28 - 17:43:32]
deploying it's deploying a bunch of

[17:43:30 - 17:43:35]
these different kinds of containers all

[17:43:32 - 17:43:37]
orchestrated together um and if we go

[17:43:35 - 17:43:40]
back over to here it's now finished

[17:43:37 - 17:43:42]
pulling it says no space left on the

[17:43:40 - 17:43:45]
device oh no I forgot to launch this

[17:43:42 - 17:43:47]
with enough space so one thing that I

[17:43:45 - 17:43:49]
forgot to do is when we launched the cc2

[17:43:47 - 17:43:53]
instance I had to make sure

[17:43:49 - 17:43:55]
that had enough storage and it doesn't

[17:43:53 - 17:43:57]
um so I'm going to have

[17:43:55 - 17:43:59]
to do this whole thing over so I'm going

[17:43:57 - 17:44:00]
to go ahead and terminate this but hey

[17:43:59 - 17:44:01]
we got the first run down so that's

[17:44:00 - 17:44:02]
pretty good it's not that big of a deal

[17:44:01 - 17:44:04]
it's not like it takes that long so I'm

[17:44:02 - 17:44:06]
going to terminate this instance I'm

[17:44:04 - 17:44:08]
going to go back over to ec2 and we'll

[17:44:06 - 17:44:10]
go ahead and launch a new

[17:44:08 - 17:44:12]
one practice makes perfect right I'm

[17:44:10 - 17:44:14]
telling you it's easier to just launch a

[17:44:12 - 17:44:16]
new instance than than it is to try to

[17:44:14 - 17:44:17]
resize the the uh the disc because

[17:44:16 - 17:44:19]
there's a little bit more work we'd have

[17:44:17 - 17:44:22]
to do I'm going to name it this time

[17:44:19 - 17:44:24]
just say opa chat chat q&

[17:44:22 - 17:44:26]
name and so we're going to go here and

[17:44:24 - 17:44:28]
choose a

[17:44:26 - 17:44:30]
buntu and that one's fine I'm going to

[17:44:28 - 17:44:32]
go here and we said

[17:44:30 - 17:44:35]
m7i

[17:44:32 - 17:44:38]
M7

[17:44:35 - 17:44:40]
I no I didn't say I was going to remove

[17:44:38 - 17:44:41]
anything I'm not sure what they're

[17:44:40 - 17:44:43]
talking

[17:44:41 - 17:44:46]
about this thing is running a little bit

[17:44:43 - 17:44:47]
slow I'm not sure what's going on here

[17:44:46 - 17:44:48]
um I don't know what's going on so I'm

[17:44:47 - 17:44:52]
going to go back to instances here I do

[17:44:48 - 17:44:54]
not TR it I'm going to go launch

[17:44:52 - 17:44:58]
instances and we'll just say

[17:44:54 - 17:44:58]
opa I'm choosing

[17:44:58 - 17:45:02]
Ubuntu

[17:45:00 - 17:45:04]
okay I'm not sure what it's trying to

[17:45:02 - 17:45:06]
spin there we go and so now we'll open

[17:45:04 - 17:45:09]
this up I'll type in

[17:45:06 - 17:45:12]
m7i and we're going to do large I've

[17:45:09 - 17:45:13]
never used it with um a large but I

[17:45:12 - 17:45:15]
think that should be proficient normally

[17:45:13 - 17:45:16]
you want to have at least four vcpus

[17:45:15 - 17:45:18]
when you're running something like a

[17:45:16 - 17:45:19]
seven bilon parameter model I'm going to

[17:45:18 - 17:45:20]
go with a key parameter we're not we're

[17:45:19 - 17:45:21]
just running a one billion parameter

[17:45:20 - 17:45:24]
model so that's pretty easy so we'll

[17:45:21 - 17:45:27]
select these two here and we only have

[17:45:24 - 17:45:28]
eight gigabytes now we saw it was only 4

[17:45:27 - 17:45:29]
gigabytes but there's not just that

[17:45:28 - 17:45:31]
that's downloading there's a bunch of

[17:45:29 - 17:45:33]
models and so I'm going to move this up

[17:45:31 - 17:45:35]
to 30 gabt which I believe is the free

[17:45:33 - 17:45:36]
tier actually says it right there so I

[17:45:35 - 17:45:39]
still am in the free tier at least for

[17:45:36 - 17:45:41]
storage not for compute um and I'm going

[17:45:39 - 17:45:44]
to go down here and I'm going to go back

[17:45:41 - 17:45:44]
and choose that imal

[17:45:44 - 17:45:49]
again um so this one's

[17:45:47 - 17:45:50]
called whichever and I showed you how

[17:45:49 - 17:45:52]
you can make that yourself we'll go

[17:45:50 - 17:45:54]
ahead and launch this instance and this

[17:45:52 - 17:45:55]
time I think we're going to have it so

[17:45:54 - 17:45:58]
we'll wait for that to launch

[17:45:55 - 17:46:00]
okay and we'll wait for it to get

[17:45:58 - 17:46:02]
initialized but yeah it's not that bad

[17:46:00 - 17:46:05]
uh having to redo this but we'll just

[17:46:02 - 17:46:08]
wait a moment here okay all right so um

[17:46:05 - 17:46:11]
the OPA is running we'll go ahead and

[17:46:08 - 17:46:14]
connect and we'll go ahead and do

[17:46:11 - 17:46:16]
this and this time we're going to get it

[17:46:14 - 17:46:18]
right I think I kept the yep the token

[17:46:16 - 17:46:19]
around so my life is not super painful

[17:46:18 - 17:46:22]
here

[17:46:19 - 17:46:24]
sometimes it takes uh two runs to do

[17:46:22 - 17:46:25]
something but that's okay we're learning

[17:46:24 - 17:46:27]
by doing something more than once okay

[17:46:25 - 17:46:30]
so we're back into here we're going to

[17:46:27 - 17:46:32]
go back over to our instructions and we

[17:46:30 - 17:46:34]
want to do all this I'm going to go

[17:46:32 - 17:46:36]
ahead I'm going to be risk a and I'm

[17:46:34 - 17:46:37]
going to try to take that entire block

[17:46:36 - 17:46:40]
and paste it in here and see what

[17:46:37 - 17:46:43]
happens okay and hopefully it just

[17:46:40 - 17:46:44]
works I have had this like where I've

[17:46:43 - 17:46:45]
used it completely and just run it end

[17:46:44 - 17:46:47]
to

[17:46:45 - 17:46:49]
end

[17:46:47 - 17:46:51]
okay so I need to go grab my keys I'm

[17:46:49 - 17:46:52]
going to go ahead and do that I'm just

[17:46:51 - 17:46:56]
going to paste it into here and we'll

[17:46:52 - 17:46:56]
grab this blocks

[17:46:57 - 17:47:03]
next

[17:46:59 - 17:47:03]
okay and we'll give that a moment to

[17:47:07 - 17:47:11]
run I'll just pause here when it's done

[17:47:10 - 17:47:13]
there we go so I'm going to go ahead and

[17:47:11 - 17:47:14]
paste this part in next we'll go ahead

[17:47:13 - 17:47:16]
and hit enter that's just getting us

[17:47:14 - 17:47:19]
into the Intel Zeon processor area and

[17:47:16 - 17:47:21]
setting that hugging face value uh we

[17:47:19 - 17:47:22]
can run this we can run this I just want

[17:47:21 - 17:47:24]
to make sure that it absolutely works

[17:47:22 - 17:47:26]
properly so I'm going to go ahead and

[17:47:24 - 17:47:29]
copy this I'm G to go ahead and paste

[17:47:26 - 17:47:30]
this in here and what I'm going to do

[17:47:29 - 17:47:32]
like we really really want to check this

[17:47:30 - 17:47:35]
I'm going to go ahead and type in set

[17:47:32 - 17:47:36]
cat EnV and it is correctly set so I

[17:47:35 - 17:47:37]
have confidence that that is correct

[17:47:36 - 17:47:39]
here we're going to go ahead and copy

[17:47:37 - 17:47:41]
these two

[17:47:39 - 17:47:43]
lines okay we'll hit

[17:47:41 - 17:47:45]
paste and so now our environment

[17:47:43 - 17:47:47]
variables are set we don't really need

[17:47:45 - 17:47:48]
to have them in the set. EMV we could

[17:47:47 - 17:47:49]
have just had them out like this I'm not

[17:47:48 - 17:47:51]
sure

[17:47:49 - 17:47:52]
I mean that's how they do it um but I I

[17:47:51 - 17:47:54]
might have coded that a little bit

[17:47:52 - 17:47:57]
differently we'll go ahead and do Docker

[17:47:54 - 17:48:00]
compose hyphen f compose yaml upd so

[17:47:57 - 17:48:02]
that is now pulling the containers which

[17:48:00 - 17:48:04]
is what it was doing last time and so

[17:48:02 - 17:48:06]
the thing with this uh layout we'll go

[17:48:04 - 17:48:08]
back over to the architectural diagram

[17:48:06 - 17:48:09]
the only thing we care about that

[17:48:08 - 17:48:12]
absolutely has to be working is the TGI

[17:48:09 - 17:48:15]
service because as we learned in other

[17:48:12 - 17:48:19]
videos TGI is the thing that

[17:48:15 - 17:48:22]
serves um that conserve llama right and

[17:48:19 - 17:48:25]
so or like our models in general and so

[17:48:22 - 17:48:27]
we want to um see to make sure that's

[17:48:25 - 17:48:28]
working and so even when all these

[17:48:27 - 17:48:30]
containers are done and it says hey

[17:48:28 - 17:48:32]
we're ready it's not actually ready

[17:48:30 - 17:48:34]
until it's act the the the TGI service

[17:48:32 - 17:48:36]
downloads the container and it might

[17:48:34 - 17:48:37]
even uh convert the model weights and

[17:48:36 - 17:48:39]
then serve it and then when it's

[17:48:37 - 17:48:40]
connected then we know absolutely that

[17:48:39 - 17:48:42]
it's working but you can see it's

[17:48:40 - 17:48:44]
pulling very quickly because we chose a

[17:48:42 - 17:48:45]
smaller model um and what's interesting

[17:48:44 - 17:48:47]
is that I don't even think the

[17:48:45 - 17:48:49]
documentation says that it can work with

[17:48:47 - 17:48:51]
that one it absolutely can

[17:48:49 - 17:48:53]
um but uh you know I don't think they're

[17:48:51 - 17:48:55]
always updating this um or it's hard to

[17:48:53 - 17:48:57]
keep up to date with the lest models but

[17:48:55 - 17:48:59]
I was able to get it working no

[17:48:57 - 17:49:01]
problem so yeah there's a lot of

[17:48:59 - 17:49:03]
documentation here but um do not worry I

[17:49:01 - 17:49:08]
have taken the time yeah there's the

[17:49:03 - 17:49:10]
mega service um to work with it

[17:49:08 - 17:49:12]
okay so yeah it's still pulling we'll

[17:49:10 - 17:49:13]
just wait a bit all right so they all

[17:49:12 - 17:49:16]
just pulled and they're getting going

[17:49:13 - 17:49:17]
here and so yeah it looks like they're

[17:49:16 - 17:49:18]
all started but we're going to have to

[17:49:17 - 17:49:20]
go and take a look here so I'm going to

[17:49:18 - 17:49:22]
do Docker PS and that's going to list

[17:49:20 - 17:49:25]
out um our containers I do believe that

[17:49:22 - 17:49:26]
I have some nice little command uh that

[17:49:25 - 17:49:28]
I have to make it a little bit easier

[17:49:26 - 17:49:29]
that's in the other repository I'm going

[17:49:28 - 17:49:31]
to go ahead and go grab that really

[17:49:29 - 17:49:33]
quickly for us here from the Gen

[17:49:31 - 17:49:35]
training uh training days workshop and

[17:49:33 - 17:49:36]
so if we go over to here into I think it

[17:49:35 - 17:49:37]
was

[17:49:36 - 17:49:40]
[Music]

[17:49:37 - 17:49:42]
Opa I have a line here you see I have

[17:49:40 - 17:49:44]
all the instructions here this line here

[17:49:42 - 17:49:46]
and this line makes our lives a lot

[17:49:44 - 17:49:49]
easier because if we go ahead and run

[17:49:46 - 17:49:53]
this okay we can now see exactly what's

[17:49:49 - 17:49:55]
running um yeah but it just formats it

[17:49:53 - 17:49:57]
so things are a little bit more um

[17:49:55 - 17:49:58]
efficient here and so as long as the TGI

[17:49:57 - 17:50:00]
service is running it most likely is

[17:49:58 - 17:50:02]
working but the reason we did this is

[17:50:00 - 17:50:03]
we're just trying to get to this here

[17:50:02 - 17:50:05]
you can obviously get it here if you

[17:50:03 - 17:50:08]
like carefully follow it but this is the

[17:50:05 - 17:50:10]
process and or the container ID I should

[17:50:08 - 17:50:12]
say and so we want the container ID so

[17:50:10 - 17:50:14]
we can check its logs so I'm going to go

[17:50:12 - 17:50:16]
ahead and copy this and I'm going to say

[17:50:14 - 17:50:19]
Docker logs and then we're going to

[17:50:16 - 17:50:21]
paste in that log and so now it's going

[17:50:19 - 17:50:23]
to tell us where where things are at

[17:50:21 - 17:50:25]
right now it's saying download file save

[17:50:23 - 17:50:27]
tensor flow so right now this is not

[17:50:25 - 17:50:28]
ready it is not yet serve the model and

[17:50:27 - 17:50:30]
so we're waiting for it to get into

[17:50:28 - 17:50:32]
connected stage so if I keep hitting up

[17:50:30 - 17:50:33]
here uh it looks like it's not doing

[17:50:32 - 17:50:37]
anything but it clearly is it's download

[17:50:33 - 17:50:39]
the safe uh safe tensors and so I'm just

[17:50:37 - 17:50:42]
moving this until it works so I'm going

[17:50:39 - 17:50:43]
to wait a few minutes a couple minutes

[17:50:42 - 17:50:45]
um but the other thing is here is that

[17:50:43 - 17:50:48]
the token file not found in uh hugging

[17:50:45 - 17:50:50]
face model supports TGI but sets a

[17:50:48 - 17:50:52]
default 4096 I'm just making sure

[17:50:50 - 17:50:54]
there's no issues here cannot determine

[17:50:52 - 17:50:56]
GPU compatibility torch not compile with

[17:50:54 - 17:50:58]
Cuda enabled that's totally fine cuz we

[17:50:56 - 17:51:00]
just want to run this on

[17:50:58 - 17:51:01]
CPUs um but yeah we'll just wait a

[17:51:00 - 17:51:03]
little bit here because it's still

[17:51:01 - 17:51:06]
working and there's no there's no

[17:51:03 - 17:51:08]
failures as far as I can tell so we will

[17:51:06 - 17:51:09]
just uh wait a few minutes okay all

[17:51:08 - 17:51:10]
right so it's been a few minutes let's

[17:51:09 - 17:51:13]
go ahead and take a look and see if our

[17:51:10 - 17:51:14]
model is actually running and so notice

[17:51:13 - 17:51:16]
there is a lot more stuff happening here

[17:51:14 - 17:51:19]
and so it's still not ready it's warming

[17:51:16 - 17:51:22]
up the model and just just remember that

[17:51:19 - 17:51:24]
we did choose a very um a very small uh

[17:51:22 - 17:51:28]
instance it says it's large but usually

[17:51:24 - 17:51:30]
I'd use a 2X or 4X so my expectation is

[17:51:28 - 17:51:34]
that it is going to be a little bit

[17:51:30 - 17:51:34]
slower but I think that we can pull it

[17:51:35 - 17:51:40]
off I like I know if we chose like a a

[17:51:38 - 17:51:42]
2X large this would have already been uh

[17:51:40 - 17:51:46]
running here but that's is what you find

[17:51:42 - 17:51:48]
out as you work with different um uh

[17:51:46 - 17:51:49]
compute here you figure out what size uh

[17:51:48 - 17:51:51]
you need to work with here but I'm going

[17:51:49 - 17:51:51]
to go

[17:51:51 - 17:51:57]
ahead and oh can I even hit up anymore

[17:51:55 - 17:52:00]
it's not letting me hit

[17:51:57 - 17:52:01]
up in fact it's becoming unresponsive so

[17:52:00 - 17:52:03]
I almost kind of

[17:52:01 - 17:52:07]
Wonder did I make a mistake and not

[17:52:03 - 17:52:07]
choose a large enough instance

[17:52:07 - 17:52:12]
size hard to say so yeah it's totally

[17:52:11 - 17:52:14]
unresponsive now I'm going to go ahead

[17:52:12 - 17:52:17]
and terminate this um not the instance

[17:52:14 - 17:52:19]
I'm going to go ahead and connect to it

[17:52:17 - 17:52:22]
again because it might be exhausting all

[17:52:19 - 17:52:27]
the CPU I'm not sure if we can

[17:52:22 - 17:52:27]
um see the CPU here at

[17:52:28 - 17:52:35]
all yeah so not not all of it but you

[17:52:31 - 17:52:38]
can see that CPUs has got up to

[17:52:35 - 17:52:40]
52% so definitely not exhausting it for

[17:52:38 - 17:52:43]
S uh uh for sure the other thing is that

[17:52:40 - 17:52:46]
um maybe we didn't give enough uh memory

[17:52:43 - 17:52:48]
available for other things yeah yeah

[17:52:46 - 17:52:50]
it's completely unresponsive so I think

[17:52:48 - 17:52:53]
this is where I made a mistake and we

[17:52:50 - 17:52:55]
just need to go up one size so yeah you

[17:52:53 - 17:52:57]
you uh you learn so this is definitely

[17:52:55 - 17:53:00]
something that um is not going to work

[17:52:57 - 17:53:01]
on on the m7i large so we'll go ahead

[17:53:00 - 17:53:03]
and terminate it and we're going to do

[17:53:01 - 17:53:05]
it one more time I promise this time it

[17:53:03 - 17:53:07]
will work but you know they say if you

[17:53:05 - 17:53:08]
do things three times then you

[17:53:07 - 17:53:11]
absolutely know how to do it and it's

[17:53:08 - 17:53:13]
it's uh locked into your core memory so

[17:53:11 - 17:53:13]
we'll go

[17:53:13 - 17:53:19]
ahead and we'll do this one more time

[17:53:16 - 17:53:21]
and I know this time it will work

[17:53:19 - 17:53:24]
and we'll go ahead and launch an

[17:53:21 - 17:53:26]
instance I'm going to say opa 3 as this

[17:53:24 - 17:53:28]
is our third attempt we're going to go

[17:53:26 - 17:53:31]
over to

[17:53:28 - 17:53:31]
buntu and we'll say

[17:53:31 - 17:53:38]
m7i and so yeah we have 8 gigabytes and

[17:53:35 - 17:53:39]
so this is going to be four vcpus I

[17:53:38 - 17:53:42]
don't know why I tried to do it with

[17:53:39 - 17:53:43]
less I just thought it might work so

[17:53:42 - 17:53:45]
we'll checkbox both of these we'll go

[17:53:43 - 17:53:48]
down below we'll go to Advanced details

[17:53:45 - 17:53:48]
we'll choose our instance profile so

[17:53:48 - 17:53:51]
it's

[17:53:48 - 17:53:53]
SSM and we'll go over to here and then

[17:53:51 - 17:53:56]
we'll go ahead and launch the

[17:53:53 - 17:53:58]
instance and so we will do as we

[17:53:56 - 17:54:01]
normally do and just wait a little bit

[17:53:58 - 17:54:02]
for this instance to be ready okay and

[17:54:01 - 17:54:04]
you know what I already made a mistake

[17:54:02 - 17:54:07]
because when we launched that instance I

[17:54:04 - 17:54:09]
forgot about the storage size so I'm

[17:54:07 - 17:54:10]
going to go do it again for the fourth

[17:54:09 - 17:54:13]
time this time I'm going to get it for

[17:54:10 - 17:54:14]
certain there's no way I'm not going to

[17:54:13 - 17:54:16]
get it here but you know practice makes

[17:54:14 - 17:54:18]
perfect we'll go here and we'll say

[17:54:16 - 17:54:22]
launch instance

[17:54:18 - 17:54:27]
Opa 4 whoops four we'll go over to a

[17:54:22 - 17:54:27]
buntu we'll choose the size it'll be

[17:54:27 - 17:54:32]
m7i x

[17:54:30 - 17:54:34]
large I'm going to scroll on down we're

[17:54:32 - 17:54:38]
going to proceed without a key pair

[17:54:34 - 17:54:41]
we'll choose these two here we'll choose

[17:54:38 - 17:54:43]
30 30

[17:54:41 - 17:54:47]
gigabytes

[17:54:43 - 17:54:49]
and then we'll go down here so this one

[17:54:47 - 17:54:50]
has

[17:54:49 - 17:54:52]
16 gigabits of ram the other thing that

[17:54:50 - 17:54:54]
I was kind of wondering is that you know

[17:54:52 - 17:54:56]
did we run out of storage space I'm

[17:54:54 - 17:54:59]
going to just jump this up to 40 just in

[17:54:56 - 17:55:01]
case just in case and then we're going

[17:54:59 - 17:55:03]
to make our way over to ec2 SSM roll and

[17:55:01 - 17:55:04]
so now we should have everything even

[17:55:03 - 17:55:07]
the the firewalls are open we'll go

[17:55:04 - 17:55:10]
ahead and launch it and this time this

[17:55:07 - 17:55:12]
time it will work it has to work I don't

[17:55:10 - 17:55:14]
want to re-shoot this

[17:55:12 - 17:55:15]
video um but these are the common

[17:55:14 - 17:55:18]
problems I almost always run with them

[17:55:15 - 17:55:20]
and that's why I'm not starting over

[17:55:18 - 17:55:22]
because I know that these are the common

[17:55:20 - 17:55:24]
issues that I run into and I think it's

[17:55:22 - 17:55:26]
worth showing that stuff off but we do

[17:55:24 - 17:55:27]
have to wait for um this to pass those

[17:55:26 - 17:55:29]
initial one so we'll have to wait a a

[17:55:27 - 17:55:31]
couple minutes here all right so let's

[17:55:29 - 17:55:33]
go ahead and connect uh to this instance

[17:55:31 - 17:55:34]
now it should be ready sometimes this

[17:55:33 - 17:55:36]
happens with sessions manager I just

[17:55:34 - 17:55:38]
click back and forth and now it will

[17:55:36 - 17:55:40]
allow us to connect to it but at this

[17:55:38 - 17:55:41]
point we should be uh super experts in

[17:55:40 - 17:55:42]
getting this configured so we'll go

[17:55:41 - 17:55:46]
ahead and type in

[17:55:42 - 17:55:48]
pseudo pseudo hyphen Su

[17:55:46 - 17:55:52]
Ubuntu and I'm going to go back back

[17:55:48 - 17:55:54]
over whoops pseudo suyen

[17:55:52 - 17:55:56]
ubu and I'm going to go back over to

[17:55:54 - 17:55:58]
here and I still have the key in there

[17:55:56 - 17:56:00]
so I'm going to now I'm really going for

[17:55:58 - 17:56:01]
it I'm going to go all the way down like

[17:56:00 - 17:56:03]
this I'm just

[17:56:01 - 17:56:06]
gonna wonder I just single shot this

[17:56:03 - 17:56:11]
here let me go here and adjust this like

[17:56:06 - 17:56:15]
this okay and if I grab this

[17:56:11 - 17:56:16]
here TR it in and we will just single

[17:56:15 - 17:56:20]
shot that there I'll just undo this so I

[17:56:16 - 17:56:20]
still have those groups

[17:56:20 - 17:56:24]
okay we'll just wait for this to

[17:56:21 - 17:56:27]
complete all right so

[17:56:24 - 17:56:28]
um we ran all that yeah it looks like we

[17:56:27 - 17:56:30]
are okay here so I'm going to go ahead

[17:56:28 - 17:56:32]
and just make sure that it ran the last

[17:56:30 - 17:56:35]
one uh it does not look like it's in the

[17:56:32 - 17:56:37]
correct location as um I expected so we

[17:56:35 - 17:56:39]
did run all this stuff but I have a

[17:56:37 - 17:56:40]
feeling it hit this and then it didn't

[17:56:39 - 17:56:42]
work so I'm going to go ahead and copy

[17:56:40 - 17:56:46]
and paste this you got to pay close

[17:56:42 - 17:56:50]
attention of what's going on here um I'm

[17:56:46 - 17:56:52]
going to go ahead and do this

[17:56:50 - 17:56:54]
I'm just going to cat out the uh that

[17:56:52 - 17:56:56]
file there that was replaced excellent

[17:56:54 - 17:56:59]
and so now we're going to do our Docker

[17:56:56 - 17:57:00]
compose up and this time this time for

[17:56:59 - 17:57:02]
certain it's going to work we'll go

[17:57:00 - 17:57:04]
ahead and hit enter and we are going to

[17:57:02 - 17:57:06]
pull those

[17:57:04 - 17:57:08]
images okay so we'll wait for them to

[17:57:06 - 17:57:09]
pull and then we'll do the same thing we

[17:57:08 - 17:57:11]
did before which is looking at the

[17:57:09 - 17:57:14]
actual

[17:57:11 - 17:57:16]
um uh TGI service and make sure that

[17:57:14 - 17:57:18]
it's launched all right and so you know

[17:57:16 - 17:57:19]
it's starting to it pulled all the

[17:57:18 - 17:57:20]
containers and it's just creating them

[17:57:19 - 17:57:23]
now and we're just going to wait till

[17:57:20 - 17:57:25]
they're in a started State and so there

[17:57:23 - 17:57:28]
we go we can do our Docker

[17:57:25 - 17:57:31]
PS uh but of course we want our nicer

[17:57:28 - 17:57:33]
line here so grab that one

[17:57:31 - 17:57:37]
here we'll paste that on in and so I'm

[17:57:33 - 17:57:41]
looking for TGI service right and we're

[17:57:37 - 17:57:44]
going to do Docker P or logs and whoops

[17:57:41 - 17:57:45]
it did not copy we'll try this again

[17:57:44 - 17:57:47]
right click copy right click paste

[17:57:45 - 17:57:49]
sometimes that's what you got to do but

[17:57:47 - 17:57:51]
then I get all this weird output that's

[17:57:49 - 17:57:53]
just fine we'll go ahead and do that so

[17:57:51 - 17:57:54]
we're now downloading it we'll just have

[17:57:53 - 17:57:56]
to wait a few minutes but I think this

[17:57:54 - 17:57:58]
time uh we're not going to have an issue

[17:57:56 - 17:58:00]
because you know we'll have enough

[17:57:58 - 17:58:03]
memory enough CPU enough storage

[17:58:00 - 17:58:04]
okay all right so um let's go take a

[17:58:03 - 17:58:05]
look and see if the model is in a

[17:58:04 - 17:58:07]
running State I've been waiting a little

[17:58:05 - 17:58:09]
bit and now it says it's connected so we

[17:58:07 - 17:58:11]
are now in good shape it says invalid

[17:58:09 - 17:58:13]
host name defaulting to 000000 so that

[17:58:11 - 17:58:15]
host name we set didn't like it but

[17:58:13 - 17:58:17]
that's that's okay because 0000 is going

[17:58:15 - 17:58:18]
to work for us as well there's a few

[17:58:17 - 17:58:20]
different ways that we can interact with

[17:58:18 - 17:58:23]
this model but the way that we really

[17:58:20 - 17:58:25]
want to interact with it is from uh the

[17:58:23 - 17:58:27]
web interface so this thing is being

[17:58:25 - 17:58:28]
served on a public IP address hopefully

[17:58:27 - 17:58:30]
you have a public IP address if you

[17:58:28 - 17:58:32]
don't you're going to have to run it

[17:58:30 - 17:58:35]
again and I'm going to go over to here

[17:58:32 - 17:58:36]
and hit enter and so I should in theory

[17:58:35 - 17:58:38]
get an interface and I do and so we have

[17:58:36 - 17:58:40]
the chat Q&A now I'm told that this can

[17:58:38 - 17:58:42]
handle rag with some particular

[17:58:40 - 17:58:44]
documents but I'm going to go say hello

[17:58:42 - 17:58:46]
let's see what it does let's say hello

[17:58:44 - 17:58:48]
how can I assist you today and so it's

[17:58:46 - 17:58:50]
running totally fine I would love to try

[17:58:48 - 17:58:53]
out the rag um I always just kind of

[17:58:50 - 17:58:56]
avoid it I don't know why but in here it

[17:58:53 - 17:58:57]
should explain to me how the rag works

[17:58:56 - 17:58:59]
just give me a moment I'll read through

[17:58:57 - 17:59:01]
it very quickly so I remember there was

[17:58:59 - 17:59:03]
an example file I can't seem to find it

[17:59:01 - 17:59:04]
it's probably somewhere else maybe we

[17:59:03 - 17:59:05]
just look at the architecture we might

[17:59:04 - 17:59:09]
be able to figure out so let's take a

[17:59:05 - 17:59:14]
look here um so we have our Vector data

[17:59:09 - 17:59:15]
data store that's fine um and it does

[17:59:14 - 17:59:17]
information extraction so here it's

[17:59:15 - 17:59:19]
saying OCR PDF data extraction web

[17:59:17 - 17:59:21]
Crawlers

[17:59:19 - 17:59:22]
um okay so the diagram illustrates the

[17:59:21 - 17:59:23]
flow of information from the chatbot

[17:59:22 - 17:59:25]
system starting from the user input

[17:59:23 - 17:59:26]
going through the retrieval anal analyze

[17:59:25 - 17:59:30]
and generate

[17:59:26 - 17:59:33]
components okay so what I'm trying to

[17:59:30 - 17:59:34]
understand is that part where it is

[17:59:33 - 17:59:36]
extracting out the

[17:59:34 - 17:59:38]
information okay because we do have an

[17:59:36 - 17:59:40]
upload interface here maybe what we can

[17:59:38 - 17:59:41]
do is explore the code and see if we can

[17:59:40 - 17:59:45]
figure it out uh so what I'm going to do

[17:59:41 - 17:59:48]
is I'm going to go over to Opa GitHub

[17:59:45 - 17:59:50]
and uh I'm going to go here into the

[17:59:48 - 17:59:52]
repositories I'm going to go into gen

[17:59:50 - 17:59:56]
examples I'm going to hit period on my

[17:59:52 - 17:59:56]
keyboard so I can open this up in

[18:00:05 - 18:00:13]
github.com we'll go into uh Intel CPU

[18:00:10 - 18:00:14]
Zeon and then into uh the standard

[18:00:13 - 18:00:16]
composed file which is what we're

[18:00:14 - 18:00:20]
utilizing so we have some services so we

[18:00:16 - 18:00:22]
have the redus data datase um we also

[18:00:20 - 18:00:24]
then we have here the data prep rdus

[18:00:22 - 18:00:27]
service okay which is dependent on the

[18:00:24 - 18:00:28]
redus vector database and the the te uh

[18:00:27 - 18:00:31]
Tei embedding

[18:00:28 - 18:00:33]
service we have the

[18:00:31 - 18:00:36]
retriever

[18:00:33 - 18:00:37]
okay and so what I'm trying to figure

[18:00:36 - 18:00:39]
out from

[18:00:37 - 18:00:42]
this is what is the thing that's doing

[18:00:39 - 18:00:42]
the conversion

[18:00:46 - 18:00:51]
right okay

[18:00:49 - 18:00:53]
yeah so here we have chat Q&A and so

[18:00:51 - 18:00:55]
that's coming from the registry there

[18:00:53 - 18:00:55]
that's totally

[18:00:56 - 18:01:00]
fine yeah and so that's what we need to

[18:00:58 - 18:01:02]
figure out we need to figure out what is

[18:01:00 - 18:01:05]
it that it's actually run running under

[18:01:02 - 18:01:08]
the hood here um I do believe that uh

[18:01:05 - 18:01:12]
these are reliant on um if we were to go

[18:01:08 - 18:01:15]
back over to here into the actual uh

[18:01:12 - 18:01:17]
comps because these are composed of um

[18:01:15 - 18:01:19]
all the examples are composed of the

[18:01:17 - 18:01:22]
components here so if I hit Peri period

[18:01:19 - 18:01:23]
here I don't they can make sense of it

[18:01:22 - 18:01:25]
there because I just want to understand

[18:01:23 - 18:01:28]
like who's doing the ocing is it doing

[18:01:25 - 18:01:30]
OCR um and if it works that's totally

[18:01:28 - 18:01:33]
fine um without us 100% knowing we could

[18:01:30 - 18:01:34]
try to figure that out later but we can

[18:01:33 - 18:01:36]
clearly see that we have a lot of

[18:01:34 - 18:01:40]
different microservices

[18:01:36 - 18:01:42]
here it says build Enterprise uh

[18:01:40 - 18:01:44]
applications Enterprise microservice or

[18:01:42 - 18:01:46]
building blocks these are the supported

[18:01:44 - 18:01:48]
ones so we're looking at here and there

[18:01:46 - 18:01:51]
are these data Preps

[18:01:48 - 18:01:53]
ones okay so I wonder if What's

[18:01:51 - 18:01:54]
Happening Here is that there's some data

[18:01:53 - 18:01:55]
preparation going on here and this is

[18:01:54 - 18:01:58]
something that I think we saw that was

[18:01:55 - 18:01:59]
running and specifically this one here

[18:01:58 - 18:02:01]
so the data prep microservice aims to

[18:01:59 - 18:02:04]
pre-process the data from various

[18:02:01 - 18:02:05]
sources either either structed or

[18:02:04 - 18:02:07]
unstructured data to text data and

[18:02:05 - 18:02:09]
convert the text data to embedding

[18:02:07 - 18:02:11]
vectors okay so this is the thing that

[18:02:09 - 18:02:14]
we actually need

[18:02:11 - 18:02:16]
um so this thing was called Data prep

[18:02:14 - 18:02:19]
which is over

[18:02:16 - 18:02:21]
here right and and um in here we're

[18:02:19 - 18:02:24]
using

[18:02:21 - 18:02:25]
redis so let's go read the read me so we

[18:02:24 - 18:02:27]
provide the data prep microservice for

[18:02:25 - 18:02:29]
multimodal data input for data data prep

[18:02:27 - 18:02:31]
microservice for text input we provide

[18:02:29 - 18:02:33]
two Frameworks here Lang chain and L

[18:02:31 - 18:02:36]
llama index we also provide Lang chain

[18:02:33 - 18:02:38]
Ray which uses Ray to paralyze the data

[18:02:36 - 18:02:40]
prep for multi performance I imagine if

[18:02:38 - 18:02:42]
you're using Ray then it's using VMS

[18:02:40 - 18:02:44]
underneath um as that's normally what's

[18:02:42 - 18:02:45]
being utilized we organize these two

[18:02:44 - 18:02:47]
folders in the same way so you can

[18:02:45 - 18:02:49]
either use either framework for data

[18:02:47 - 18:02:52]
prep services with the following

[18:02:49 - 18:02:53]
constructions okay so I'm not sure which

[18:02:52 - 18:02:55]
one it's utilizing but the idea is that

[18:02:53 - 18:02:57]
um we can look at one or other let's

[18:02:55 - 18:02:59]
just assume it's using Lang chain here

[18:02:57 - 18:03:00]
and we'll go into here and take a look

[18:02:59 - 18:03:02]
so we have a Docker file here and it's

[18:03:00 - 18:03:05]
setting some stuff up it's entering with

[18:03:02 - 18:03:07]
prepared Doc redus and so if we go into

[18:03:05 - 18:03:09]
prepare doc redus now we're starting to

[18:03:07 - 18:03:11]
see some code okay and so we can see

[18:03:09 - 18:03:13]
Lang chain

[18:03:11 - 18:03:16]
here

[18:03:13 - 18:03:19]
and what I'm looking for is like what is

[18:03:16 - 18:03:21]
happening with preparation

[18:03:19 - 18:03:23]
so here we have comp's data prep Source

[18:03:21 - 18:03:26]
utilities and so we have a document

[18:03:23 - 18:03:26]
uploader and a bunch of other

[18:03:26 - 18:03:30]
components

[18:03:28 - 18:03:33]
[Music]

[18:03:30 - 18:03:36]
M let me go up here so we have comps

[18:03:33 - 18:03:39]
data prep Source

[18:03:36 - 18:03:41]
utils comps data

[18:03:39 - 18:03:44]
preps

[18:03:41 - 18:03:47]
source utils so here's some of the

[18:03:44 - 18:03:47]
utilities that we're utilizing

[18:03:49 - 18:03:53]
I'm just trying to get it like what can

[18:03:50 - 18:03:53]
it

[18:03:55 - 18:04:00]
process uh converting doc file to docx

[18:03:58 - 18:04:03]
so at least it can work with docx files

[18:04:00 - 18:04:06]
it can work with

[18:04:03 - 18:04:07]
PowerPoints okay so it supports a a wide

[18:04:06 - 18:04:11]
variety of

[18:04:07 - 18:04:11]
documents but does it have

[18:04:11 - 18:04:18]
PDF that's what I don't

[18:04:14 - 18:04:21]
know low PF so it looks like that it

[18:04:18 - 18:04:23]
supports a a wide range of a r a wide

[18:04:21 - 18:04:25]
range of things so let's find out if we

[18:04:23 - 18:04:27]
can actually get this to work um I have

[18:04:25 - 18:04:28]
not played around with the rag enough to

[18:04:27 - 18:04:29]
know if it will work so I'm just trying

[18:04:28 - 18:04:32]
to think of something I can download so

[18:04:29 - 18:04:33]
I'm just say uh Japanese language

[18:04:32 - 18:04:37]
learning

[18:04:33 - 18:04:38]
PDF and we'll go to easy easy Japanese

[18:04:37 - 18:04:39]
which I actually heard of this one

[18:04:38 - 18:04:41]
before I downloaded before and I have

[18:04:39 - 18:04:44]
yet to play around with it for my own

[18:04:41 - 18:04:45]
language learning um but the question is

[18:04:44 - 18:04:48]
like does it have text that we can

[18:04:45 - 18:04:50]
extract out of here we absolutely do

[18:04:48 - 18:04:51]
oh we certainly have a lot of

[18:04:50 - 18:04:53]
interesting stuff in

[18:04:51 - 18:04:57]
here okay great so what I'm going to do

[18:04:53 - 18:04:59]
is go ahead and download this and it is

[18:04:57 - 18:05:00]
three uh megabytes that's not that big

[18:04:59 - 18:05:02]
of a deal so I'm going to go over to my

[18:05:00 - 18:05:04]
desktop we'll go ahead and download that

[18:05:02 - 18:05:06]
really quickly there so now I have it

[18:05:04 - 18:05:07]
downloaded I'm just going to open it up

[18:05:06 - 18:05:10]
and just give it a quick

[18:05:07 - 18:05:13]
renaming I'm just renaming it to easy

[18:05:10 - 18:05:15]
Japanese so I can easily find

[18:05:13 - 18:05:19]
it and so now I have it downloaded I'm

[18:05:15 - 18:05:21]
going to go back over to here

[18:05:19 - 18:05:23]
to here where is it here here here where

[18:05:21 - 18:05:25]
are you there it is we're going to go

[18:05:23 - 18:05:27]
ahead and upload this

[18:05:25 - 18:05:29]
file um so I'll go ahead and upload and

[18:05:27 - 18:05:31]
choose the

[18:05:29 - 18:05:33]
file and I'm just going here and I'm

[18:05:31 - 18:05:36]
looking

[18:05:33 - 18:05:39]
for easy Japanese PDF and so now I've

[18:05:36 - 18:05:39]
uploaded that file it's

[18:05:44 - 18:05:48]
uploading I'm not sure how long it takes

[18:05:46 - 18:05:50]
but we'll wait a a little bit here to

[18:05:48 - 18:05:52]
see what happens and now just remember

[18:05:50 - 18:05:55]
the type of file we're using is not a uh

[18:05:52 - 18:05:57]
simple file it has it's it's a obviously

[18:05:55 - 18:05:59]
mixed language so I'm not sure if we

[18:05:57 - 18:06:01]
should have only been using uh purely

[18:05:59 - 18:06:02]
English here but we'd have to do a

[18:06:01 - 18:06:04]
little bit more research to figure this

[18:06:02 - 18:06:06]
out please upload your file uh or paste

[18:06:04 - 18:06:08]
a Remote Link and uh and chat will

[18:06:06 - 18:06:10]
respond based on the contents here so

[18:06:08 - 18:06:11]
it's still spinning and so it's making

[18:06:10 - 18:06:14]
me think that it's still uploading it or

[18:06:11 - 18:06:16]
processing it um I'm not 100% certain

[18:06:14 - 18:06:18]
but we'll go over to our Network Tab and

[18:06:16 - 18:06:20]
this might be one way that we can kind

[18:06:18 - 18:06:23]
of keep track of what's going on

[18:06:20 - 18:06:25]
here and I'm not sure so I'm gonna give

[18:06:23 - 18:06:28]
this a nice hard

[18:06:25 - 18:06:30]
refresh and now saying oh the site's not

[18:06:28 - 18:06:31]
reachable give it a second it might be

[18:06:30 - 18:06:33]
my internet to be honest we'll go here

[18:06:31 - 18:06:34]
and say testing half the time my

[18:06:33 - 18:06:38]
internet kicks out

[18:06:34 - 18:06:42]
here but

[18:06:38 - 18:06:42]
um we'll go back over to our instance

[18:06:43 - 18:06:49]
here and I'm just going to make sure our

[18:06:45 - 18:06:49]
instances are still running Docker PS

[18:06:49 - 18:06:53]
yeah they they all appear to still be

[18:06:51 - 18:06:56]
running oh you know what I think it's

[18:06:53 - 18:06:58]
because it put the HTTP htps in there

[18:06:56 - 18:07:00]
sometimes that happens

[18:06:58 - 18:07:02]
um I went to full screen by accident too

[18:07:00 - 18:07:05]
and I can't get out of full screen said

[18:07:02 - 18:07:07]
hold Escape there we go okay so I'll

[18:07:05 - 18:07:11]
click into this and we'll just take off

[18:07:07 - 18:07:12]
the thats there we go and so is that

[18:07:11 - 18:07:14]
document uploaded I don't know but I'm

[18:07:12 - 18:07:18]
going to make sure I have this open this

[18:07:14 - 18:07:20]
time and so if there is a problem

[18:07:18 - 18:07:23]
with the upload then we'll find out with

[18:07:20 - 18:07:25]
that here okay so I'm going to go ahead

[18:07:23 - 18:07:29]
and upload that file again and we'll go

[18:07:25 - 18:07:30]
to easy Japanese we'll say uh open and

[18:07:29 - 18:07:32]
I'm going to go to my network tab

[18:07:30 - 18:07:35]
hopefully I capture that information and

[18:07:32 - 18:07:35]
it is sending the data

[18:07:38 - 18:07:42]
over okay so when we get a response back

[18:07:40 - 18:07:43]
from that we'll know it's okay so I'm

[18:07:42 - 18:07:44]
going to pause the video and wait a

[18:07:43 - 18:07:46]
little bit but maybe the file's too

[18:07:44 - 18:07:48]
large I'm not sure if there's any file

[18:07:46 - 18:07:50]
limitations here but we'll we'll do our

[18:07:48 - 18:07:51]
best here we'll just wait okay all right

[18:07:50 - 18:07:53]
so I've waited a little bit here and if

[18:07:51 - 18:07:54]
we take a look it's still uploading so

[18:07:53 - 18:07:55]
clearly there's something wrong with the

[18:07:54 - 18:07:57]
file that I'm uploading I don't think

[18:07:55 - 18:08:00]
it's the um the code here but it might

[18:07:57 - 18:08:01]
be a little bit too difficult to debug

[18:08:00 - 18:08:06]
um I'm going to see if I can find a

[18:08:01 - 18:08:07]
simpler PDF so just say uh doc docx uh

[18:08:06 - 18:08:10]
learning Japanese let's see if we can

[18:08:07 - 18:08:10]
find a simple one

[18:08:11 - 18:08:15]
here I just want a really really really

[18:08:13 - 18:08:20]
simple one so maybe what I'll do is I'll

[18:08:15 - 18:08:20]
make my own uh word do file we'll go

[18:08:20 - 18:08:26]
here and I'm just going to go over to

[18:08:22 - 18:08:31]
chat GPT I'm going say uh um generate

[18:08:26 - 18:08:32]
out me a uh um generate out

[18:08:31 - 18:08:35]
me

[18:08:32 - 18:08:37]
a document for

[18:08:35 - 18:08:40]
learning yeah well actually we'll go

[18:08:37 - 18:08:42]
over to here we'll say

[18:08:40 - 18:08:49]
gp24 I think it's 401 that has the

[18:08:42 - 18:08:49]
advanced so gener me generate me out

[18:08:50 - 18:08:56]
a learning

[18:08:52 - 18:08:58]
guide for Japanese language

[18:08:56 - 18:09:00]
learning and I know I spelled it wrong I

[18:08:58 - 18:09:02]
don't care I'm going to open up a new

[18:09:00 - 18:09:02]
document

[18:09:07 - 18:09:12]
here and it goes and goes and goes and

[18:09:10 - 18:09:12]
goes and

[18:09:15 - 18:09:19]
goes okay I'm going to go go ahead and

[18:09:17 - 18:09:22]
copy this I have a word doc here I'm

[18:09:19 - 18:09:22]
going to go ahead and paste it in

[18:09:22 - 18:09:28]
here and I'm going to go ahead and we'll

[18:09:25 - 18:09:31]
say save as I'm going to save this to my

[18:09:28 - 18:09:31]
desktop as per

[18:09:38 - 18:09:41]
usual and I'm just going to say uh

[18:09:40 - 18:09:45]
learning

[18:09:41 - 18:09:47]
guide Japanese so that is now a docx

[18:09:45 - 18:09:49]
file I'm going to go over to here back

[18:09:47 - 18:09:51]
over to here and we're going to go ahead

[18:09:49 - 18:09:55]
and now upload that file so just give me

[18:09:51 - 18:09:56]
a moment to choose that file you can't

[18:09:55 - 18:09:59]
see it but I'm just choosing it off

[18:09:56 - 18:10:01]
screen here if I can find the file I

[18:09:59 - 18:10:03]
just

[18:10:01 - 18:10:05]
made

[18:10:03 - 18:10:06]
um sometimes when you put things on your

[18:10:05 - 18:10:09]
desktop they're not actually on your

[18:10:06 - 18:10:09]
desktop it's very

[18:10:11 - 18:10:16]
frustrating what did I call this

[18:10:14 - 18:10:18]
file I know you can't see what I'm doing

[18:10:16 - 18:10:20]
but I'm just talking myself while I'm

[18:10:18 - 18:10:23]
working through this here uh learning oh

[18:10:20 - 18:10:26]
learning okay so L for

[18:10:23 - 18:10:27]
learning I swear sometimes I just put

[18:10:26 - 18:10:29]
things on my desktop and they're not

[18:10:27 - 18:10:31]
there like I totally made the file it

[18:10:29 - 18:10:33]
should exist and it refuses to show up

[18:10:31 - 18:10:36]
no matter what so I have to make like a

[18:10:33 - 18:10:38]
junk folder to put it in just so that I

[18:10:36 - 18:10:39]
can find it it's so stupid we're going

[18:10:38 - 18:10:42]
to go ahead and we'll save this file

[18:10:39 - 18:10:44]
again save it as and I'm putting it

[18:10:42 - 18:10:47]
[Music]

[18:10:44 - 18:10:48]
into uh new folder too

[18:10:47 - 18:10:49]
we'll save it there even though I

[18:10:48 - 18:10:52]
shouldn't have to do that I'm going to

[18:10:49 - 18:10:52]
try to upload this

[18:10:53 - 18:10:59]
again so it definitely exists in this

[18:10:56 - 18:11:01]
folder all files oh maybe it was always

[18:10:59 - 18:11:03]
there okay so now I have a word doc and

[18:11:01 - 18:11:05]
I'm hoping that I can process

[18:11:03 - 18:11:06]
that if it can it's not a big deal but

[18:11:05 - 18:11:08]
it might require a little bit more work

[18:11:06 - 18:11:10]
that's outside the scope of this for me

[18:11:08 - 18:11:13]
to to debug this would be a lot easier

[18:11:10 - 18:11:14]
for me to debug locally is um then I

[18:11:13 - 18:11:16]
would have all the containers that I can

[18:11:14 - 18:11:19]
I can view them easily we can do them in

[18:11:16 - 18:11:20]
here as well but uh I would very much

[18:11:19 - 18:11:21]
prefer to do that somewhere else but we

[18:11:20 - 18:11:23]
do have all these

[18:11:21 - 18:11:25]
services and the one that's prepping is

[18:11:23 - 18:11:28]
the data prep so we could go in here and

[18:11:25 - 18:11:31]
take a look so we say Docker logs and I

[18:11:28 - 18:11:35]
just go ahead and copy this one

[18:11:31 - 18:11:38]
here copy paste

[18:11:35 - 18:11:41]
enter and so here it says oh they did

[18:11:38 - 18:11:45]
upload it says Easy japanese. PDF does

[18:11:41 - 18:11:49]
not exist unsupported color space for CM

[18:11:45 - 18:11:49]
YK for BGR for Red Data

[18:11:49 - 18:11:54]
um so it definitely was attempting to uh

[18:11:52 - 18:11:56]
Implement one file easy Japanese does

[18:11:54 - 18:11:57]
not exist so yeah I'm not exactly sure

[18:11:56 - 18:11:58]
what's wrong with this but I think we

[18:11:57 - 18:12:00]
would have to do a little bit more

[18:11:58 - 18:12:02]
debugging to figure out um this is still

[18:12:00 - 18:12:04]
really really good I just again I'd have

[18:12:02 - 18:12:05]
to spend a little bit more time on it

[18:12:04 - 18:12:08]
and to be honest I always have a bit of

[18:12:05 - 18:12:09]
trouble with rag there are files that do

[18:12:08 - 18:12:11]
work with this I just can't find them

[18:12:09 - 18:12:13]
right now but we'll consider this done

[18:12:11 - 18:12:15]
and uh that's the best we can do here

[18:12:13 - 18:12:17]
today so we'll go ahead and terminate it

[18:12:15 - 18:12:19]
and so yeah that is uh an easy way for

[18:12:17 - 18:12:21]
you to launch container services and

[18:12:19 - 18:12:22]
you're kind of getting the idea of how

[18:12:21 - 18:12:24]
you could work with that stuff I'm going

[18:12:22 - 18:12:26]
to make sure I delete my key out of here

[18:12:24 - 18:12:27]
um as something I forget to do quite

[18:12:26 - 18:12:30]
often I'm going to go over to here and

[18:12:27 - 18:12:34]
we are going to just R this part out

[18:12:30 - 18:12:39]
okay so just say uh set key and I'm

[18:12:34 - 18:12:41]
going to go ahead here and update this

[18:12:39 - 18:12:45]
WIP okay and I will see you in the next

[18:12:41 - 18:12:45]
one ciao

[18:12:45 - 18:12:48]
[Music]

[18:12:47 - 18:12:51]
let's talk about kerve which is more of

[18:12:48 - 18:12:53]
a generalized tool for deploying machine

[18:12:51 - 18:12:56]
learning models on kubernetes Via K

[18:12:53 - 18:12:59]
native uh K native is a serverless way

[18:12:56 - 18:13:00]
of working with kubernetes uh we won't

[18:12:59 - 18:13:02]
get too much into that but we will talk

[18:13:00 - 18:13:05]
about kerve and that it can be utilized

[18:13:02 - 18:13:07]
to deploy ml models and also large

[18:13:05 - 18:13:09]
language models so here's an example of

[18:13:07 - 18:13:13]
some configuration code that we would uh

[18:13:09 - 18:13:15]
utilize to deploy uh Cav serve as a

[18:13:13 - 18:13:16]
service within kubernetes and here we're

[18:13:15 - 18:13:20]
specifying the runtime we're saying

[18:13:16 - 18:13:21]
cerve Pi torch server but I know this is

[18:13:20 - 18:13:23]
actually using the hugging face

[18:13:21 - 18:13:26]
Transformer uh to utilize it

[18:13:23 - 18:13:27]
specifically using uh the P torch server

[18:13:26 - 18:13:30]
and so K serve can serve the following

[18:13:27 - 18:13:34]
kinds of models so can serve tensor RT

[18:13:30 - 18:13:36]
tensorflow pytorch sklearn XG boost Onyx

[18:13:34 - 18:13:37]
and there's a lot of models that are

[18:13:36 - 18:13:41]
onyx compatible so you can see it can do

[18:13:37 - 18:13:42]
a lot of stuff um if you can uh see

[18:13:41 - 18:13:44]
there I'm just going to get my pen tool

[18:13:42 - 18:13:46]
out if I can find it here but notice

[18:13:44 - 18:13:48]
that we have the layer so here we have K

[18:13:46 - 18:13:50]
native which is a a serverless layer

[18:13:48 - 18:13:53]
then kubernetes which will utilize the

[18:13:50 - 18:13:55]
underlying resources um so this is not

[18:13:53 - 18:13:57]
something that I would demo just because

[18:13:55 - 18:13:59]
it's a lot of work to show but I want

[18:13:57 - 18:14:02]
you to generally know that there is this

[18:13:59 - 18:14:06]
generic model in kubernetes to serve

[18:14:02 - 18:14:09]
models and it can serve llms as well

[18:14:06 - 18:14:12]
[Music]

[18:14:09 - 18:14:14]
okay all right let's take a look at VM

[18:14:12 - 18:14:16]
which is an open source library to serve

[18:14:14 - 18:14:19]
large language models I believe the V

[18:14:16 - 18:14:21]
stand transfer virtual um and it's

[18:14:19 - 18:14:25]
really straightforward the idea is that

[18:14:21 - 18:14:27]
you can use the the VM uh CLI service to

[18:14:25 - 18:14:30]
say VM serve um so I believe you would

[18:14:27 - 18:14:32]
install that using pip install VM you

[18:14:30 - 18:14:34]
can also uh serve it via Docker

[18:14:32 - 18:14:36]
container though I will say that because

[18:14:34 - 18:14:38]
there are various ways to serve it

[18:14:36 - 18:14:39]
probably the best way or the way that I

[18:14:38 - 18:14:41]
like to serve it would be through

[18:14:39 - 18:14:43]
containers as you'll find that a lot of

[18:14:41 - 18:14:44]
these servers that's the way that they

[18:14:43 - 18:14:47]
will recommend to do it or will be the

[18:14:44 - 18:14:48]
only way to do it I could talk to all

[18:14:47 - 18:14:51]
the functionalities of VM but to be

[18:14:48 - 18:14:53]
honest most of these Services out there

[18:14:51 - 18:14:54]
basically do the same things as they're

[18:14:53 - 18:14:56]
all trying to keep parity with each

[18:14:54 - 18:14:58]
other the only reason you might choose

[18:14:56 - 18:15:01]
one over the other if you were using a

[18:14:58 - 18:15:04]
very specific llm model that only worked

[18:15:01 - 18:15:06]
on VM but did not work on TG or vice

[18:15:04 - 18:15:08]
versa so again it's not worth it getting

[18:15:06 - 18:15:11]
to all the little bits of it because I

[18:15:08 - 18:15:12]
couldn't find a a a a huge difference

[18:15:11 - 18:15:14]
but even when we go to the actual uh you

[18:15:12 - 18:15:16]
know information here they talk about

[18:15:14 - 18:15:18]
all these things it can do and all these

[18:15:16 - 18:15:20]
ways you can deploy it um and so I would

[18:15:18 - 18:15:22]
say that it does have a lot more

[18:15:20 - 18:15:23]
deployment methods than other ones but

[18:15:22 - 18:15:25]
to be honest most people are running

[18:15:23 - 18:15:26]
these things in containers uh but yeah

[18:15:25 - 18:15:30]
there you

[18:15:26 - 18:15:32]
[Music]

[18:15:30 - 18:15:34]
go all right let's talk about rayer so

[18:15:32 - 18:15:37]
Ray is a collection of libraries for AI

[18:15:34 - 18:15:40]
workloads and Ray serve can be used to

[18:15:37 - 18:15:42]
serve AI models with VM such as llms I

[18:15:40 - 18:15:45]
know at one point there was something

[18:15:42 - 18:15:47]
called Ray llms but since BLM has done

[18:15:45 - 18:15:49]
so well uh Ray

[18:15:47 - 18:15:52]
uh retired that open source project and

[18:15:49 - 18:15:55]
now they recommend to use the llms and

[18:15:52 - 18:15:57]
so you can find um Ray under Ray

[18:15:55 - 18:15:59]
projects and so they'll also have Ray

[18:15:57 - 18:16:01]
serve there as well and so you can see

[18:15:59 - 18:16:02]
that Ray is actually collection of

[18:16:01 - 18:16:05]
libraries and we're just focusing

[18:16:02 - 18:16:07]
specifically on Ray serve right now if

[18:16:05 - 18:16:09]
you ever heard of apachi spark Ray is

[18:16:07 - 18:16:11]
often positioned against uh against as a

[18:16:09 - 18:16:13]
replacement for apachi spark we're not

[18:16:11 - 18:16:15]
talking about all the other parts that

[18:16:13 - 18:16:18]
you can do of Ray just Ray serve here as

[18:16:15 - 18:16:21]
we are only concerned about serving llms

[18:16:18 - 18:16:24]
um the reason you would use uh rayer

[18:16:21 - 18:16:26]
with VMS is that if you think about VMS

[18:16:24 - 18:16:28]
it is only designed to scale to a single

[18:16:26 - 18:16:31]
server so if you wanted it to be

[18:16:28 - 18:16:34]
distributed uh to take your LM and

[18:16:31 - 18:16:36]
utilize multiple uh compute uh or

[18:16:34 - 18:16:38]
servers then you would use Ray to help

[18:16:36 - 18:16:40]
distribute the workload across multiple

[18:16:38 - 18:16:42]
machines the way you would do that is

[18:16:40 - 18:16:45]
you'd have to obviously write python

[18:16:42 - 18:16:47]
code um it's not as simple as launching

[18:16:45 - 18:16:49]
a single container you will have to

[18:16:47 - 18:16:51]
write code in order to do this um but

[18:16:49 - 18:16:54]
you know it does make things a lot more

[18:16:51 - 18:16:57]
powerful so there you

[18:16:54 - 18:17:00]
[Music]

[18:16:57 - 18:17:02]
go all right let's talk about TGI and

[18:17:00 - 18:17:04]
Tei these are both open source uh

[18:17:02 - 18:17:06]
libraries by hugging face and so TGI

[18:17:04 - 18:17:09]
stands for text generation interface

[18:17:06 - 18:17:11]
it's for serving llms and then we have

[18:17:09 - 18:17:12]
uh Tei which is text embeddings

[18:17:11 - 18:17:14]
interface uh which is this is for

[18:17:12 - 18:17:17]
specifically serving llms that have

[18:17:14 - 18:17:19]
output embeddings and you can see that

[18:17:17 - 18:17:20]
the way you use them is very similar uh

[18:17:19 - 18:17:23]
the only way that I really know how to

[18:17:20 - 18:17:24]
utilize this is with Docker containers

[18:17:23 - 18:17:26]
there probably is some way to use Python

[18:17:24 - 18:17:30]
code or do it but this is really the way

[18:17:26 - 18:17:32]
you want to uh use TGI and Tei um why do

[18:17:30 - 18:17:35]
they have two separate ones when they

[18:17:32 - 18:17:37]
could have um uh like they're both llms

[18:17:35 - 18:17:39]
so why isn't TGI serving both um

[18:17:37 - 18:17:40]
embeddings and things like that I don't

[18:17:39 - 18:17:42]
know maybe there's something to do with

[18:17:40 - 18:17:45]
the code but a lot of times when you

[18:17:42 - 18:17:48]
look at these um uh these servers they

[18:17:45 - 18:17:50]
are implementing some kind of of level

[18:17:48 - 18:17:52]
of the architecture underneath to adapt

[18:17:50 - 18:17:55]
to a bunch of different llm models and

[18:17:52 - 18:17:56]
so obviously the way text embedding LMS

[18:17:55 - 18:17:59]
is going to be a little bit different

[18:17:56 - 18:18:02]
than uh ones that are outputting um

[18:17:59 - 18:18:03]
generation and so uh that kind of makes

[18:18:02 - 18:18:05]
sense to me as to why there would be a

[18:18:03 - 18:18:08]
separation of these models uh but you

[18:18:05 - 18:18:09]
can see it's very straightforward uh to

[18:18:08 - 18:18:12]
uh serve a model here one thing you'll

[18:18:09 - 18:18:14]
want to notice is look where it says the

[18:18:12 - 18:18:15]
model flag so I'm just going to get my

[18:18:14 - 18:18:17]
pen tool out here if I can find it but

[18:18:15 - 18:18:19]
notice here this one's is going to run

[18:18:17 - 18:18:21]
gpt2 this one's passing a variable but

[18:18:19 - 18:18:23]
um the idea is that in these do

[18:18:21 - 18:18:26]
containers you're literally passing over

[18:18:23 - 18:18:29]
exactly what you want to run

[18:18:26 - 18:18:32]
[Music]

[18:18:29 - 18:18:33]
okay let's talk about tensor rtlm before

[18:18:32 - 18:18:37]
we talk about that let's talk about

[18:18:33 - 18:18:38]
tensor RT which is an ecosystem of apis

[18:18:37 - 18:18:40]
for high performance deep learning

[18:18:38 - 18:18:43]
inference it's specifically for

[18:18:40 - 18:18:45]
optimizing models for Target hardware

[18:18:43 - 18:18:47]
and specifically Nvidia gpus I didn't

[18:18:45 - 18:18:48]
specifically just say for NVIDIA gpus

[18:18:47 - 18:18:50]
because I'm not sure if it could be used

[18:18:48 - 18:18:54]
for something else but generally it's

[18:18:50 - 18:18:56]
for uh Nvidia gpus um and to be honest

[18:18:54 - 18:18:58]
envid uh learning how to code with

[18:18:56 - 18:19:00]
tensor RT is out of scope for this as it

[18:18:58 - 18:19:04]
is very challenging however I did want

[18:19:00 - 18:19:06]
to talk about tensor rtlm which is um

[18:19:04 - 18:19:09]
more reasonable for something that we

[18:19:06 - 18:19:11]
might be able to do um and so the idea

[18:19:09 - 18:19:13]
with tensor RT LMS allows you to serve

[18:19:11 - 18:19:15]
an L model using the tensor RT engine

[18:19:13 - 18:19:18]
using python code so what you would do

[18:19:15 - 18:19:19]
is you would download um a checkpoint

[18:19:18 - 18:19:23]
and if you don't know what a checkpoint

[18:19:19 - 18:19:26]
is it is a um a state in which a model

[18:19:23 - 18:19:29]
weights exist and then you convert that

[18:19:26 - 18:19:32]
format over to tensor RT LM checkpoint

[18:19:29 - 18:19:34]
you would then build a tensor RT engine

[18:19:32 - 18:19:36]
uh from that converted engine uh that

[18:19:34 - 18:19:38]
converted checkpoint format file and

[18:19:36 - 18:19:39]
then you could run inference this is not

[18:19:38 - 18:19:42]
something that I would ever do a lab on

[18:19:39 - 18:19:44]
it's just too complicated but because

[18:19:42 - 18:19:47]
you'll see tensor RT a lot mentioned I

[18:19:44 - 18:19:49]
wanted to make sure that you got some uh

[18:19:47 - 18:19:52]
exposure to tensor RT

[18:19:49 - 18:19:54]
[Music]

[18:19:52 - 18:19:56]
okay hey everyone in this video I want

[18:19:54 - 18:19:59]
to show you Intel Tyber AI Cloud which

[18:19:56 - 18:20:03]
is a platform for Intel that allows you

[18:19:59 - 18:20:04]
to utilize uh their latest gpus and CPUs

[18:20:03 - 18:20:06]
uh but also they have a bunch of

[18:20:04 - 18:20:08]
notebooks there so if you want to uh

[18:20:06 - 18:20:10]
play around with a bunch of complex

[18:20:08 - 18:20:12]
projects in AI you absolutely can do

[18:20:10 - 18:20:13]
that um I'm already signed up so I'm

[18:20:12 - 18:20:15]
just going to go ahead and sign in and

[18:20:13 - 18:20:18]
so this is bringing me to cloud.

[18:20:15 - 18:20:19]
console. cloud. Intel do. Cloud this

[18:20:18 - 18:20:22]
project has been named a few times it

[18:20:19 - 18:20:23]
used to be Intel Intel developer Cloud

[18:20:22 - 18:20:26]
then it was renamed to Intel Tyber

[18:20:23 - 18:20:28]
developer Cloud now it's Intel Tyber AI

[18:20:26 - 18:20:30]
Cloud um but you know this is no

[18:20:28 - 18:20:31]
different than any other provider name

[18:20:30 - 18:20:33]
renaming things 100 times let me get

[18:20:31 - 18:20:35]
logged in here just give me a moment

[18:20:33 - 18:20:37]
okay all right so I'm just getting

[18:20:35 - 18:20:40]
signed in here I just have to do an SMS

[18:20:37 - 18:20:43]
verification uh and we'll get in here

[18:20:40 - 18:20:47]
just in a moment

[18:20:43 - 18:20:49]
703 5 73

[18:20:47 - 18:20:50]
and so we'll go ahead and uh oh I think

[18:20:49 - 18:20:54]
I typed it wrong so I'll try that one

[18:20:50 - 18:20:54]
more time sometimes I mess up the

[18:20:57 - 18:21:02]
codes and now I'm in okay great and so

[18:21:01 - 18:21:04]
this thing has been

[18:21:02 - 18:21:06]
getting better and better every time I

[18:21:04 - 18:21:09]
come in here so I've been pretty excited

[18:21:06 - 18:21:10]
about it uh you us region one out

[18:21:09 - 18:21:13]
computer sold out right now so you can

[18:21:10 - 18:21:14]
see it's very popular um you can run

[18:21:13 - 18:21:17]
kubernetes clusters on here I have yet

[18:21:14 - 18:21:19]
to do so you can launch Compu from here

[18:21:17 - 18:21:21]
um and you know the only reason that

[18:21:19 - 18:21:23]
you'd want to launch compute from here

[18:21:21 - 18:21:27]
as opposed to something like AWS is that

[18:21:23 - 18:21:29]
they will have um uh a compute that you

[18:21:27 - 18:21:31]
just simply can't get any other other

[18:21:29 - 18:21:33]
places so if you want to utilize um I'm

[18:21:31 - 18:21:35]
not sure if it shows up here I might not

[18:21:33 - 18:21:38]
have access to it as you might have to

[18:21:35 - 18:21:40]
request access but there could be things

[18:21:38 - 18:21:41]
like GTI 3 I don't see it here but I

[18:21:40 - 18:21:44]
think I'd have to actually request to

[18:21:41 - 18:21:45]
get access to GTI so he says Gotti 3 AI

[18:21:44 - 18:21:47]
processors are now available in the

[18:21:45 - 18:21:49]
cloud

[18:21:47 - 18:21:53]
but your count has to be approved for it

[18:21:49 - 18:21:54]
so GTI 3 is their latest AI accelerator

[18:21:53 - 18:21:56]
um but yeah you can see that they have a

[18:21:54 - 18:21:57]
bunch of processes there whereas on 8s

[18:21:56 - 18:21:59]
they only have godi one right so if you

[18:21:57 - 18:22:01]
want godi 2 or goddi 3 godi 2 I think

[18:21:59 - 18:22:03]
you get IBM but God 3 you can only get

[18:22:01 - 18:22:06]
it here currently but what I really want

[18:22:03 - 18:22:08]
to show you is the learning notebooks as

[18:22:06 - 18:22:10]
this is a way to start working with a

[18:22:08 - 18:22:12]
bunch of stuff uh right away so if you

[18:22:10 - 18:22:14]
want to learn how to fine-tune llama

[18:22:12 - 18:22:16]
with hugging face here uh and have a

[18:22:14 - 18:22:19]
complete project set up you can launch

[18:22:16 - 18:22:21]
it up here and it should launch up here

[18:22:19 - 18:22:22]
uh why it's not working right now

[18:22:21 - 18:22:24]
probably because I right clicked it I

[18:22:22 - 18:22:27]
was trying to open it a separate Tab and

[18:22:24 - 18:22:29]
so that kind of messed it up um and so I

[18:22:27 - 18:22:31]
just need to relog into my account so

[18:22:29 - 18:22:34]
just give me a moment here I'll relog

[18:22:31 - 18:22:36]
back in here uh just a second my

[18:22:34 - 18:22:37]
autofill is messing it up here there we

[18:22:36 - 18:22:39]
go okay so I'm just sending another code

[18:22:37 - 18:22:44]
and verifying

[18:22:39 - 18:22:50]
it okay so I have another number here

[18:22:44 - 18:22:50]
8999 51 and verify the code

[18:22:53 - 18:22:58]
okay and we will just give this a moment

[18:22:56 - 18:23:00]
to start up so it is starting up a

[18:22:58 - 18:23:02]
Jupiter Hub

[18:23:00 - 18:23:03]
environment but this is just another

[18:23:02 - 18:23:06]
place that you can learn so obviously

[18:23:03 - 18:23:08]
there's sagemaker Studio Labs there's

[18:23:06 - 18:23:10]
Google uh Google Co collab but then

[18:23:08 - 18:23:11]
there's also these ones here so yeah we

[18:23:10 - 18:23:14]
just have an environment it's pretty

[18:23:11 - 18:23:16]
straightforward you run it you can learn

[18:23:14 - 18:23:18]
stuff on it but this one in particular

[18:23:16 - 18:23:22]
like here it's saying Gotti 2 a

[18:23:18 - 18:23:24]
accelerator so um this one might be

[18:23:22 - 18:23:26]
utilizing Gotti 2 I didn't realize I

[18:23:24 - 18:23:29]
spun up God 2 did

[18:23:26 - 18:23:32]
I uh oh yeah okay yeah so yeah we're

[18:23:29 - 18:23:34]
utilizing God 2 and so this is a great

[18:23:32 - 18:23:36]
way like if you did have did not have

[18:23:34 - 18:23:38]
any other way of accessing D

[18:23:36 - 18:23:39]
accelerators because they get really

[18:23:38 - 18:23:43]
expensive then this is a way that you

[18:23:39 - 18:23:45]
could start uh learning with it okay so

[18:23:43 - 18:23:47]
I'm just carefully looking here um I

[18:23:45 - 18:23:49]
don't remember exactly what is the Gotti

[18:23:47 - 18:23:51]
2 part of the code here it's been a

[18:23:49 - 18:23:54]
while but the point is is that if you

[18:23:51 - 18:23:56]
want to utilize gotti2 processors this

[18:23:54 - 18:23:59]
is a place that you can do it okay then

[18:23:56 - 18:24:01]
obviously we have the AI with Mac series

[18:23:59 - 18:24:03]
gpus um and then if you want to learn

[18:24:01 - 18:24:05]
how to use sickle you could do that as

[18:24:03 - 18:24:09]
well but again you know if you are

[18:24:05 - 18:24:12]
buying hardware and it happens to be

[18:24:09 - 18:24:16]
Intel processors or Mac series gpus or

[18:24:12 - 18:24:19]
got 2 uh god1 god3 accelerators then you

[18:24:16 - 18:24:20]
can play in this playground to learn how

[18:24:19 - 18:24:23]
to work with them before you make those

[18:24:20 - 18:24:24]
Hardware purchases um but just in

[18:24:23 - 18:24:27]
general for learning their stuff here

[18:24:24 - 18:24:28]
and so I just wanted to show you that uh

[18:24:27 - 18:24:30]
that's about it um and so I'll see you

[18:24:28 - 18:24:33]
in the next one okay

[18:24:30 - 18:24:35]
[Music]

[18:24:33 - 18:24:37]
ciao all right I want to take a look at

[18:24:35 - 18:24:39]
runp pod I've never used this before um

[18:24:37 - 18:24:41]
and it's a place where you can develop

[18:24:39 - 18:24:42]
train and scale AI models I think it's

[18:24:41 - 18:24:46]
unfair not to take a look at all

[18:24:42 - 18:24:47]
possible options um and I've heard about

[18:24:46 - 18:24:48]
this one but I've just never bothered

[18:24:47 - 18:24:49]
signing up so I'm going to go ahead and

[18:24:48 - 18:24:51]
sign up here

[18:24:49 - 18:24:53]
today and we'll find out if there's a

[18:24:51 - 18:24:55]
free tier I'm going to go ahead and use

[18:24:53 - 18:24:58]
my Google account if it's paid do not

[18:24:55 - 18:25:00]
worry about it just don't use it um or

[18:24:58 - 18:25:02]
use it if you have the money and you

[18:25:00 - 18:25:04]
like the experience I don't

[18:25:02 - 18:25:05]
know we're just exploring and making

[18:25:04 - 18:25:07]
sure we have options here so I'm going

[18:25:05 - 18:25:09]
to go ahead I don't want to subscribe

[18:25:07 - 18:25:11]
but I'll go ahead and accept the terms

[18:25:09 - 18:25:14]
and service again never used this

[18:25:11 - 18:25:16]
service before interface looks okay what

[18:25:14 - 18:25:18]
I'm looking for is notebooks as they

[18:25:16 - 18:25:21]
said that they can run notebooks but

[18:25:18 - 18:25:25]
clearly this can run other things so

[18:25:21 - 18:25:27]
deploy a GPU uh pod um Auto scale your

[18:25:25 - 18:25:29]
your workload traffic storage refer

[18:25:27 - 18:25:32]
friends to earn credits I'm not sure if

[18:25:29 - 18:25:36]
we have any usage it says z00 Z at the

[18:25:32 - 18:25:38]
top here okay spend limit is $40 an hour

[18:25:36 - 18:25:40]
a day so I'm not sure uh if we have

[18:25:38 - 18:25:44]
anything here but where are these

[18:25:40 - 18:25:46]
notebooks that they promised us do we

[18:25:44 - 18:25:47]
have to deploy a pod

[18:25:46 - 18:25:49]
because I mean I guess it's just like

[18:25:47 - 18:25:52]
you're running anything right so if you

[18:25:49 - 18:25:53]
run something does does runpod have a

[18:25:52 - 18:25:56]
free

[18:25:53 - 18:25:59]
tier let's go take a look

[18:25:56 - 18:25:59]
here

[18:25:59 - 18:26:05]
um does runp POD have a free

[18:26:06 - 18:26:11]
tier I'm not sure if they do

[18:26:12 - 18:26:16]
[Music]

[18:26:18 - 18:26:21]
more power less

[18:26:21 - 18:26:25]
cost I mean they had free gpus a couple

[18:26:24 - 18:26:28]
years

[18:26:25 - 18:26:29]
ago I mean to be fair I understand if if

[18:26:28 - 18:26:33]
they're not providing that stuff for

[18:26:29 - 18:26:35]
free but um you know maybe we can try

[18:26:33 - 18:26:37]
again I'm not really sold on this thing

[18:26:35 - 18:26:39]
but I still think that we can try it and

[18:26:37 - 18:26:41]
use it for for fun to see if I can

[18:26:39 - 18:26:43]
launch stuff here I'm seeing stuff for

[18:26:41 - 18:26:45]
serving so that's VMS like that's a

[18:26:43 - 18:26:48]
that's a server but I'm thinking what it

[18:26:45 - 18:26:53]
is it's just Let's us run anything so

[18:26:48 - 18:26:53]
say runp pod runp pod

[18:26:55 - 18:27:01]
notebooks okay so how do we do

[18:26:58 - 18:27:03]
that so select a pod choose your gpus

[18:27:01 - 18:27:05]
choose an instance search a template so

[18:27:03 - 18:27:09]
here they have templates that already

[18:27:05 - 18:27:11]
exist for it um and so I just want

[18:27:09 - 18:27:14]
something that's very very inexpensive

[18:27:11 - 18:27:16]
as an example to show and so I'm looking

[18:27:14 - 18:27:18]
through here

[18:27:16 - 18:27:21]
and these are gpus let's go over to

[18:27:18 - 18:27:23]
CPUs as I really don't want to spend a

[18:27:21 - 18:27:25]
whole lot I just want to see it

[18:27:23 - 18:27:27]
working and I might have to attach a

[18:27:25 - 18:27:30]
credit card for

[18:27:27 - 18:27:33]
this

[18:27:30 - 18:27:36]
so I just want general

[18:27:33 - 18:27:39]
purpose that the compute optimize is

[18:27:36 - 18:27:42]
um this one's more expensive than that

[18:27:39 - 18:27:44]
one you think that general purpose would

[18:27:42 - 18:27:46]
be less that's fine so we'll go down

[18:27:44 - 18:27:48]
below here I'm going to choose a

[18:27:46 - 18:27:51]
template and I think they said there was

[18:27:48 - 18:27:55]
one for notebooks

[18:27:51 - 18:27:58]
Jupiter nope let's go back over to here

[18:27:55 - 18:27:59]
um select a pod choose a GPU inance

[18:27:58 - 18:28:01]
select search for a template that

[18:27:59 - 18:28:07]
includes Jupiter

[18:28:01 - 18:28:11]
notebook okay so we go here I don't see

[18:28:07 - 18:28:13]
it I don't see a template for it edit

[18:28:11 - 18:28:17]
template

[18:28:13 - 18:28:19]
um yeah there's no there's no template

[18:28:17 - 18:28:22]
so I'm not well over here there's

[18:28:19 - 18:28:22]
templates new

[18:28:22 - 18:28:28]
template

[18:28:25 - 18:28:32]
again there's no templates to

[18:28:28 - 18:28:34]
search so I'm not sure about this but

[18:28:32 - 18:28:37]
clearly um we could like I could install

[18:28:34 - 18:28:39]
one by default run the notebook so

[18:28:37 - 18:28:40]
here yeah this one this is one way of

[18:28:39 - 18:28:42]
doing it I don't know if I like this

[18:28:40 - 18:28:45]
like I'm not saying that run pod is bad

[18:28:42 - 18:28:47]
but it's clearly not showing a a fast

[18:28:45 - 18:28:52]
and straightforward way to set up a

[18:28:47 - 18:28:52]
notebook um but we clearly could do

[18:28:53 - 18:28:58]
it what if I was to go back over to gpus

[18:28:55 - 18:28:59]
for a second disc card changes so I'm G

[18:28:58 - 18:29:03]
to go back over to pods I'm going to

[18:28:59 - 18:29:07]
choose this here um I don't care what it

[18:29:03 - 18:29:10]
is I'm looking through here uh yeah how

[18:29:07 - 18:29:13]
about an A40 I like how there's more

[18:29:10 - 18:29:14]
information about it um like I I anyway

[18:29:13 - 18:29:17]
we'll go ahead and change the

[18:29:14 - 18:29:20]
template let's so now we have okay there

[18:29:17 - 18:29:24]
we go so now if I go

[18:29:20 - 18:29:24]
Jupiter Jupiter

[18:29:25 - 18:29:30]
Jupiter that P torch is that what this

[18:29:27 - 18:29:33]
one is this is a runp pod P

[18:29:30 - 18:29:36]
torch um so again just looking for the

[18:29:33 - 18:29:38]
lowest cost so this one's pretty low the

[18:29:36 - 18:29:38]
RTX

[18:29:39 - 18:29:42]
a5000 I can't remember runp pod is the

[18:29:41 - 18:29:47]
one where they're borrowing from other

[18:29:42 - 18:29:50]
people runp pod runp pod

[18:29:47 - 18:29:52]
I think runp pod is like it might be uh

[18:29:50 - 18:29:53]
oh I clicked on Lightning AI they have

[18:29:52 - 18:29:56]
an ad for

[18:29:53 - 18:29:58]
it is it other people's globally

[18:29:56 - 18:30:01]
distributed gpus for the cloud so I

[18:29:58 - 18:30:03]
think that this is the one where you are

[18:30:01 - 18:30:07]
you are utilizing other people's

[18:30:03 - 18:30:10]
gpus okay that's what I think it is um

[18:30:07 - 18:30:12]
but anyway I don't care I just want the

[18:30:10 - 18:30:13]
lowest cost one so we'll go over to here

[18:30:12 - 18:30:16]
I just want to see if the templates are

[18:30:13 - 18:30:17]
still available yes it is and I haven't

[18:30:16 - 18:30:20]
paid for anything yet so I'm not sure

[18:30:17 - 18:30:22]
how this is going to work but we're

[18:30:20 - 18:30:23]
going to choose on demand and we'll say

[18:30:22 - 18:30:25]
Deploy on demand and it's going to say

[18:30:23 - 18:30:26]
insufficient fund so I have to load up a

[18:30:25 - 18:30:28]
little bit of money here and so I'm

[18:30:26 - 18:30:29]
going to go ahead and do that so just

[18:30:28 - 18:30:33]
give me a moment to load up some some

[18:30:29 - 18:30:36]
money here okay it'll just take me a

[18:30:33 - 18:30:36]
moment

[18:30:37 - 18:30:41]
um I guess I could do

[18:30:42 - 18:30:48]
that I don't know if that's my card or I

[18:30:45 - 18:30:50]
don't know if I want to do this because

[18:30:48 - 18:30:51]
like you can't choose less than $25

[18:30:50 - 18:30:53]
right and I don't know if I'm going to

[18:30:51 - 18:30:55]
come back and use run pod so you know

[18:30:53 - 18:30:56]
what I think this is where I'm going to

[18:30:55 - 18:30:58]
call quits like it looks like it's it's

[18:30:56 - 18:31:01]
fine like it has templates but I don't

[18:30:58 - 18:31:03]
feel like dumping $25 in here if it was

[18:31:01 - 18:31:05]
less like $10 or five maybe I can choose

[18:31:03 - 18:31:07]
the amount maybe I can say $5 can I oh

[18:31:05 - 18:31:09]
no the lowest I can choose is $2 well

[18:31:07 - 18:31:12]
let's do $2 I can handle

[18:31:09 - 18:31:14]
$2 if I just keep if I'm I'm going to

[18:31:12 - 18:31:16]
spend on a lot of services so if I if I

[18:31:14 - 18:31:18]
do that b might get mad at me be like

[18:31:16 - 18:31:20]
Andrew why do you keep throwing like $30

[18:31:18 - 18:31:23]
here $30 there for services you weren't

[18:31:20 - 18:31:27]
using so going to go ahead and try two

[18:31:23 - 18:31:30]
nope can I do five nope can I do

[18:31:27 - 18:31:32]
10 so I can do 10 that's the lowest I

[18:31:30 - 18:31:36]
can do so I can do that that's totally

[18:31:32 - 18:31:36]
fine so I'll go ahead and say

[18:31:36 - 18:31:40]
purchase 9518 I don't know if that's my

[18:31:39 - 18:31:42]
credit card or someone else's just give

[18:31:40 - 18:31:44]
me a second and I tried to buy it

[18:31:42 - 18:31:46]
wouldn't let me buy it uh we have a It's

[18:31:44 - 18:31:49]
Tricky with my company credit card card

[18:31:46 - 18:31:50]
so I don't know I guess I can't really

[18:31:49 - 18:31:53]
test well you know what just give me a

[18:31:50 - 18:31:55]
second I'll just use my my other card

[18:31:53 - 18:31:56]
and that doesn't work so that was my

[18:31:55 - 18:31:58]
best attempt here with runp pod here

[18:31:56 - 18:32:00]
today now it's not their fault they're

[18:31:58 - 18:32:01]
just using link tree here but I imagine

[18:32:00 - 18:32:03]
what would happen is we would launch up

[18:32:01 - 18:32:05]
that jupyter notebook and we could have

[18:32:03 - 18:32:07]
that experience and so that's just

[18:32:05 - 18:32:09]
another place where you can buy uh gpus

[18:32:07 - 18:32:10]
and now that I'm memory it runpod is

[18:32:09 - 18:32:11]
just like if you're looking for

[18:32:10 - 18:32:13]
something that is most cost effective

[18:32:11 - 18:32:15]
then you can use these gpus which are

[18:32:13 - 18:32:17]
distributed um but you know again maybe

[18:32:15 - 18:32:19]
at some point I will go and figure this

[18:32:17 - 18:32:21]
out but uh you know this is not working

[18:32:19 - 18:32:23]
here today so I'm going to have to move

[18:32:21 - 18:32:25]
on from a runp pod and at least we took

[18:32:23 - 18:32:28]
a look around and we know that we can at

[18:32:25 - 18:32:29]
least go with a $10 one for me as

[18:32:28 - 18:32:32]
someone exploring I wish I could even

[18:32:29 - 18:32:35]
just load up $5 but runpod if you're

[18:32:32 - 18:32:36]
listening um that's something that I I

[18:32:35 - 18:32:39]
think that you might want to consider uh

[18:32:36 - 18:32:41]
when doing it but we did give it a look

[18:32:39 - 18:32:43]
okay so I might visit it later but that

[18:32:41 - 18:32:45]
was the experience we had okay all right

[18:32:43 - 18:32:46]
I got an email that came through that it

[18:32:45 - 18:32:48]
said my payment went through so despite

[18:32:46 - 18:32:50]
it saying it failed um maybe it actually

[18:32:48 - 18:32:52]
did work and I'm going to go ahead and

[18:32:50 - 18:32:55]
log into runpod and notice we actually

[18:32:52 - 18:32:57]
have $10 now so we clearly have some uh

[18:32:55 - 18:32:59]
spend that we can utilize so let's go

[18:32:57 - 18:33:01]
ahead and deploy a pod and we noce with

[18:32:59 - 18:33:03]
gpus that's the only place where we see

[18:33:01 - 18:33:04]
that template right now for the jupyter

[18:33:03 - 18:33:06]
notebook I'm sure I could get it working

[18:33:04 - 18:33:09]
in in uh the CPU one but I don't want to

[18:33:06 - 18:33:11]
do that here today uh it's interesting

[18:33:09 - 18:33:12]
we have security cloud and Community

[18:33:11 - 18:33:15]
Cloud I'm not sure what the difference

[18:33:12 - 18:33:16]
is maybe there's a a class difference um

[18:33:15 - 18:33:18]
I would would imagine that there would

[18:33:16 - 18:33:21]
be because if it's Community you have

[18:33:18 - 18:33:22]
more options and it's more um cost

[18:33:21 - 18:33:24]
effective but I'm going to go to secure

[18:33:22 - 18:33:25]
Cloud here today um as that was the

[18:33:24 - 18:33:27]
default here it looks like we can also

[18:33:25 - 18:33:30]
choose a lot of locations for where our

[18:33:27 - 18:33:32]
stuff is running uh again looking for

[18:33:30 - 18:33:35]
the most uh inexpensive thing that we

[18:33:32 - 18:33:39]
can run um and so it'd be nice if it's

[18:33:35 - 18:33:39]
sorted based on cost maybe we can do

[18:33:40 - 18:33:47]
that I'm not seeing that here today

[18:33:46 - 18:33:49]
so yeah I would just say I don't like

[18:33:47 - 18:33:50]
the fact that I have to kind of like

[18:33:49 - 18:33:53]
figure what the cheapest cost is I kind

[18:33:50 - 18:33:54]
of wish this was a table but you know we

[18:33:53 - 18:33:57]
got what we got so I'm not going to

[18:33:54 - 18:34:01]
Super complain here um but you know we

[18:33:57 - 18:34:03]
have the RTX 200000 Ada so I wouldn't

[18:34:01 - 18:34:04]
mind trying that out that's pretty cost

[18:34:03 - 18:34:07]
effective that's a uh that's something

[18:34:04 - 18:34:09]
that goes right into the laptop um is is

[18:34:07 - 18:34:11]
low in the bottom low

[18:34:09 - 18:34:14]
availability um I don't

[18:34:11 - 18:34:17]
need much here we have high availability

[18:34:14 - 18:34:19]
for the RTX 8 4 500 let's go ahead and

[18:34:17 - 18:34:20]
use that I just want this to work here

[18:34:19 - 18:34:23]
today and we'll go ahead and change the

[18:34:20 - 18:34:27]
template okay and so it said that there

[18:34:23 - 18:34:30]
is one here for Jupiter um

[18:34:27 - 18:34:31]
specifically so I'm looking for Jupiter

[18:34:30 - 18:34:32]
I don't see it so I'm just going to type

[18:34:31 - 18:34:35]
it in here

[18:34:32 - 18:34:37]
Jupiter so we have Jupiter Pi

[18:34:35 - 18:34:39]
torch so this seems like this would be a

[18:34:37 - 18:34:40]
template that would have uh Jupiter and

[18:34:39 - 18:34:43]
that we could start utilizing it I only

[18:34:40 - 18:34:44]
need one gpus here today uh one week

[18:34:43 - 18:34:45]
savings plan that's cool but I don't

[18:34:44 - 18:34:47]
need something for a week but I could

[18:34:45 - 18:34:49]
see like if you needed something for a

[18:34:47 - 18:34:51]
period of time that could be interesting

[18:34:49 - 18:34:54]
um and let's go ahead and Deploy on

[18:34:51 - 18:34:54]
demand and see what we

[18:34:55 - 18:34:59]
get so now we're just waiting for this

[18:34:57 - 18:35:01]
deployment to occur so we'll just wait a

[18:34:59 - 18:35:03]
little bit here not sure how long it

[18:35:01 - 18:35:05]
should really take but I can't imagine

[18:35:03 - 18:35:08]
that long

[18:35:05 - 18:35:09]
um and yeah it's doing stuff so it's

[18:35:08 - 18:35:10]
downloading stuff so we can clearly see

[18:35:09 - 18:35:13]
what's going on so just going to wait

[18:35:10 - 18:35:14]
till it's completely ready okay all

[18:35:13 - 18:35:16]
right so uh yeah I'm just still waiting

[18:35:14 - 18:35:18]
for this to spin up it's it's been uh

[18:35:16 - 18:35:19]
quite a few minutes here I think um but

[18:35:18 - 18:35:21]
you can just clearly see that it is

[18:35:19 - 18:35:23]
downloading containers so that's

[18:35:21 - 18:35:25]
basically what I'm waiting for it to do

[18:35:23 - 18:35:27]
um the other thing is like I'm not not

[18:35:25 - 18:35:29]
sure where this actually is being spun

[18:35:27 - 18:35:32]
up as I didn't specifically pick where

[18:35:29 - 18:35:33]
it is what does Ro stand for Romania I

[18:35:32 - 18:35:35]
suppose I don't think it would really

[18:35:33 - 18:35:37]
matter if it was Romania I don't think

[18:35:35 - 18:35:41]
it would really matter um as I'm not

[18:35:37 - 18:35:45]
looking for uh super fast latency here

[18:35:41 - 18:35:47]
but it is taking time to pull this stuff

[18:35:45 - 18:35:48]
um and it could just be the the the

[18:35:47 - 18:35:49]
image that is being utilized here is

[18:35:48 - 18:35:52]
just really large

[18:35:49 - 18:35:53]
so it's hard to say but even if this

[18:35:52 - 18:35:55]
does get

[18:35:53 - 18:35:58]
working then what you know what I mean

[18:35:55 - 18:36:02]
because I'm not sure exactly how I get

[18:35:58 - 18:36:03]
into this um oh we have a connect button

[18:36:02 - 18:36:06]
okay so I think what happens once this

[18:36:03 - 18:36:07]
is completely done if it does finish

[18:36:06 - 18:36:09]
we'll have a connect button we'll give

[18:36:07 - 18:36:11]
that a go

[18:36:09 - 18:36:13]
okay all right so after a very very long

[18:36:11 - 18:36:14]
wait it didn't take minutes I now have

[18:36:13 - 18:36:17]
it running and I've already had a bit of

[18:36:14 - 18:36:18]
spend not a bit big deal um as it says

[18:36:17 - 18:36:23]
40 cents an

[18:36:18 - 18:36:25]
hour uh GPU Cloud span is about that but

[18:36:23 - 18:36:27]
now let's go ahead and do connect and so

[18:36:25 - 18:36:31]
we have a couple options here we have

[18:36:27 - 18:36:33]
basic SSH terminal SSH Overexposed start

[18:36:31 - 18:36:35]
web terminal what I want to

[18:36:33 - 18:36:39]
do is I just want to connect to it so

[18:36:35 - 18:36:42]
HTP Port 8888 not

[18:36:39 - 18:36:44]
ready um so I'm not sure what port this

[18:36:42 - 18:36:47]
runs on by

[18:36:44 - 18:36:49]
default we do have public IP address

[18:36:47 - 18:36:54]
here

[18:36:49 - 18:36:58]
right say default port for um what's it

[18:36:54 - 18:37:01]
called uh Jupiter Labs Jupiter notebook

[18:36:58 - 18:37:03]
is it is it 888 it is and so it's

[18:37:01 - 18:37:03]
suggesting here

[18:37:04 - 18:37:11]
that this one's not ready we'll click it

[18:37:08 - 18:37:12]
anyway okay so we're on runp pod here

[18:37:11 - 18:37:14]
I'm not sure what AI Doc is I've never

[18:37:12 - 18:37:19]
seen that

[18:37:14 - 18:37:22]
before uh um let's see runp pod I AI doc

[18:37:19 - 18:37:22]
like what is

[18:37:25 - 18:37:33]
it login like what what would it be just

[18:37:30 - 18:37:34]
give me a second okay all right so here

[18:37:33 - 18:37:38]
we have a username but it doesn't

[18:37:34 - 18:37:39]
specify what the password is um and so I

[18:37:38 - 18:37:42]
don't know what it

[18:37:39 - 18:37:42]
is

[18:37:42 - 18:37:47]
um because we know that this is the

[18:37:44 - 18:37:47]
username

[18:37:47 - 18:37:52]
name or parts of it

[18:37:50 - 18:37:54]
is yeah it is so this is the

[18:37:52 - 18:37:58]
username right but how would I know what

[18:37:54 - 18:37:59]
the password is right I I wouldn't um

[18:37:58 - 18:38:02]
and there's no indicator as to how you

[18:37:59 - 18:38:02]
get the

[18:38:05 - 18:38:09]
password enter the username and

[18:38:09 - 18:38:14]
password

[18:38:12 - 18:38:16]
okay so I'm going to go make a note for

[18:38:14 - 18:38:17]
them I'm trying to be helpful but uh

[18:38:16 - 18:38:19]
they might not like my feedback but I'm

[18:38:17 - 18:38:22]
going to go ahead and give them some

[18:38:19 - 18:38:24]
feedback here all right so here I am and

[18:38:22 - 18:38:27]
I'm requesting information so I'm going

[18:38:24 - 18:38:30]
to go here to this page here and let's

[18:38:27 - 18:38:30]
just tell them

[18:38:35 - 18:38:39]
like and we'll go back over to

[18:38:41 - 18:38:46]
here and I'll go here

[18:38:49 - 18:38:56]
so to say you know I have launched a pod

[18:38:53 - 18:39:00]
with gpus uh with the py

[18:38:56 - 18:39:03]
torch pytorch

[18:39:00 - 18:39:06]
Jupiter and I wanted to show people how

[18:39:03 - 18:39:10]
to connect to the web

[18:39:06 - 18:39:13]
terminal to show how they can work in a

[18:39:10 - 18:39:17]
notebook again on a

[18:39:13 - 18:39:17]
OD um

[18:39:21 - 18:39:24]
when I click web

[18:39:28 - 18:39:34]
terminal I have to

[18:39:30 - 18:39:34]
enter a username and

[18:39:37 - 18:39:43]
password it's clear what the username is

[18:39:41 - 18:39:45]
should be I have no idea what the

[18:39:43 - 18:39:47]
password

[18:39:45 - 18:39:51]
is supposed to

[18:39:47 - 18:39:54]
be there is a a lack of documentation

[18:39:51 - 18:39:57]
explaining what to use okay there we go

[18:39:54 - 18:40:00]
so that's all I can do um it's not again

[18:39:57 - 18:40:03]
it's not very clear right

[18:40:00 - 18:40:07]
um like maybe we could use the

[18:40:03 - 18:40:09]
SSH uh part of the SSH key to do

[18:40:07 - 18:40:12]
it but there's nothing here it just says

[18:40:09 - 18:40:14]
password right so that's not helpful

[18:40:12 - 18:40:17]
whatsoever um but anyway we gave it our

[18:40:14 - 18:40:19]
we gave it our best try here um but so

[18:40:17 - 18:40:23]
far you know I probably wouldn't use

[18:40:19 - 18:40:25]
this I don't particularly like it um and

[18:40:23 - 18:40:28]
considering how long it took for it to

[18:40:25 - 18:40:31]
start up that's not

[18:40:28 - 18:40:32]
uh that's not uh you know like if you

[18:40:31 - 18:40:34]
have a workload you have to generally

[18:40:32 - 18:40:35]
know how long it takes to start up um it

[18:40:34 - 18:40:36]
feels like there might be additional

[18:40:35 - 18:40:39]
spend but if you're doing something over

[18:40:36 - 18:40:41]
a week or two weeks yeah that's less of

[18:40:39 - 18:40:43]
an issue but uh yeah definitely

[18:40:41 - 18:40:46]
something that I wouldn't um try

[18:40:43 - 18:40:49]
again and I think it stopped

[18:40:46 - 18:40:50]
yep it is exited and we'll call this one

[18:40:49 - 18:40:54]
done okay

[18:40:50 - 18:40:55]
[Music]

[18:40:54 - 18:40:58]
ciao all right let's take a look at

[18:40:55 - 18:40:59]
grock so grock is a place where it

[18:40:58 - 18:41:03]
serves up open source models so it's

[18:40:59 - 18:41:05]
providing inference via API and also an

[18:41:03 - 18:41:07]
interface so I believe if we go down

[18:41:05 - 18:41:10]
below here we can actually start uh

[18:41:07 - 18:41:12]
trying out uh Gro what's really cool is

[18:41:10 - 18:41:15]
also has a voice feature using whisper

[18:41:12 - 18:41:19]
large uh three so we could talk to it

[18:41:15 - 18:41:20]
here um I want to see if I can capture

[18:41:19 - 18:41:23]
yeah we are capturing system sound so

[18:41:20 - 18:41:24]
let's see what happens if we do this so

[18:41:23 - 18:41:26]
I'm going to go ahead and just sign up

[18:41:24 - 18:41:28]
with uh my my Google here and so I

[18:41:26 - 18:41:30]
should be connected

[18:41:28 - 18:41:32]
now and I'm going to say allow when

[18:41:30 - 18:41:37]
using the

[18:41:32 - 18:41:37]
site can you teach me how to speak

[18:41:37 - 18:41:41]
Japanese and then I'll hit pause here

[18:41:40 - 18:41:43]
and so right away we're getting stuff

[18:41:41 - 18:41:45]
back here and you can just see how fast

[18:41:43 - 18:41:47]
it is so they're just trying to emphas

[18:41:45 - 18:41:48]
how fast their inference is the amount

[18:41:47 - 18:41:50]
of tokens that are being used and things

[18:41:48 - 18:41:52]
like that so that is really cool but if

[18:41:50 - 18:41:53]
we wanted to start building with it we

[18:41:52 - 18:41:55]
can go over to the playground and I

[18:41:53 - 18:41:57]
believe that we can get a free API so I

[18:41:55 - 18:41:59]
literally just pressed Google or my

[18:41:57 - 18:42:01]
Google account to get connected and so

[18:41:59 - 18:42:03]
maybe I want to go ahead here and create

[18:42:01 - 18:42:05]
a new API key um so we'll give it a

[18:42:03 - 18:42:08]
moment here I do need to verify with

[18:42:05 - 18:42:11]
Cloud flare we'll just say my API

[18:42:08 - 18:42:13]
key and we'll go ahead and create that

[18:42:11 - 18:42:15]
and so now we have an API

[18:42:13 - 18:42:17]
key that we can utilize I'm just going

[18:42:15 - 18:42:20]
to store it over here for the moment as

[18:42:17 - 18:42:21]
I'm not just ready to use it just yet um

[18:42:20 - 18:42:23]
but let's say we start wanted to start

[18:42:21 - 18:42:25]
working with it we can go over here and

[18:42:23 - 18:42:27]
we do have a playground but I want to

[18:42:25 - 18:42:28]
programmatically work and we can see

[18:42:27 - 18:42:30]
that there are a bunch of different

[18:42:28 - 18:42:34]
models that we can utilize we have

[18:42:30 - 18:42:37]
whisper large version three uh llama 3.1

[18:42:34 - 18:42:39]
8 billion Gemma uh 9 billion uh

[18:42:37 - 18:42:41]
parameters let's say we want to use

[18:42:39 - 18:42:43]
Gemma here we could view some code and

[18:42:41 - 18:42:45]
get some code and maybe we can start

[18:42:43 - 18:42:47]
working with this so we do have an API

[18:42:45 - 18:42:49]
key over uh here that we're going to

[18:42:47 - 18:42:52]
hold on to I'm going to copy this and

[18:42:49 - 18:42:54]
I'm going to make my way over to um

[18:42:52 - 18:42:56]
GitHub and I'm actually going to launch

[18:42:54 - 18:43:01]
this into GitHub codes spaces here

[18:42:56 - 18:43:03]
today um so we'll go ahead and we will

[18:43:01 - 18:43:05]
launch code

[18:43:03 - 18:43:07]
spaces all right and so we'll just give

[18:43:05 - 18:43:09]
it a moment here to

[18:43:07 - 18:43:11]
connect always takes a little bit of

[18:43:09 - 18:43:13]
time so we'll just wait a little bit

[18:43:11 - 18:43:15]
okay all right so our environment is up

[18:43:13 - 18:43:17]
I need to change this over to Dark theme

[18:43:15 - 18:43:19]
otherwise it's going to be a little bit

[18:43:17 - 18:43:20]
hard for me here today so we'll switch

[18:43:19 - 18:43:23]
over to here I'm going to make a new

[18:43:20 - 18:43:26]
folder we'll say allow a new folder

[18:43:23 - 18:43:28]
called Gro and I just want to bring in

[18:43:26 - 18:43:30]
that code example that we saw so if we

[18:43:28 - 18:43:32]
go back over to here here we have our

[18:43:30 - 18:43:33]
code example I like how we have other

[18:43:32 - 18:43:37]
implementations I'm just stick with

[18:43:33 - 18:43:39]
python and this will just be Gemma dopy

[18:43:37 - 18:43:41]
I'm going to go ahead and paste this on

[18:43:39 - 18:43:42]
in here we're going to probably need um

[18:43:41 - 18:43:45]
Gro as a requirement so I'm going to go

[18:43:42 - 18:43:48]
ahead and just type in requirements.txt

[18:43:45 - 18:43:50]
um and we're going to just type in grock

[18:43:48 - 18:43:54]
and it looks like it is compatible with

[18:43:50 - 18:43:57]
the open a a AI um API which we often

[18:43:54 - 18:43:58]
see uh quite a few places so I'm going

[18:43:57 - 18:44:01]
to do a pip install hyphen R

[18:43:58 - 18:44:01]
requirements.txt

[18:44:02 - 18:44:06]
uh txt here I'll bump up the font a

[18:44:04 - 18:44:09]
little bit I realize it's a bit small we

[18:44:06 - 18:44:11]
might as well get in our python our

[18:44:09 - 18:44:14]
python. EnV here as we should not

[18:44:11 - 18:44:17]
externally load um variables and we'll

[18:44:14 - 18:44:20]
just put in a git ignore and in our git

[18:44:17 - 18:44:24]
ignore we will ignore a EnV file and now

[18:44:20 - 18:44:27]
I will add a EnV file um a new file here

[18:44:24 - 18:44:30]
and this will be EnV and this will have

[18:44:27 - 18:44:34]
our API or we'll say grock API

[18:44:30 - 18:44:37]
key there might be a very specific

[18:44:34 - 18:44:39]
um environment uh variable that would

[18:44:37 - 18:44:43]
automatically get loaded I'm just going

[18:44:39 - 18:44:43]
to manually load it if I have

[18:44:43 - 18:44:47]
to I mean it's it's not showing it here

[18:44:45 - 18:44:50]
so there must be a very specific one so

[18:44:47 - 18:44:53]
we'll just say grock API key

[18:44:50 - 18:44:55]
nbar it probably has a very very

[18:44:53 - 18:44:55]
specific

[18:44:56 - 18:45:02]
name oh it's grock API key oh did I get

[18:44:59 - 18:45:05]
it right even without

[18:45:02 - 18:45:06]
knowing I did excellent okay so great so

[18:45:05 - 18:45:09]
that is there now I'm going to do

[18:45:06 - 18:45:11]
another pip uh requirements.txt because

[18:45:09 - 18:45:13]
we now have it I know there's other code

[18:45:11 - 18:45:15]
where we have loaded in our nbars so I'm

[18:45:13 - 18:45:18]
going to go down into maybe this one

[18:45:15 - 18:45:21]
here I'm going to grab these three lines

[18:45:18 - 18:45:24]
as we'll need all three of them maybe um

[18:45:21 - 18:45:26]
maybe not the OS one but we'll see and

[18:45:24 - 18:45:28]
I'm going to go ahead and just paste

[18:45:26 - 18:45:30]
that on in here so the idea is that now

[18:45:28 - 18:45:32]
it should be contextually aware of that

[18:45:30 - 18:45:35]
environment variable it's using Gemma 9

[18:45:32 - 18:45:38]
billion uh um it I'm not sure what the

[18:45:35 - 18:45:39]
it stands for maybe instructions and so

[18:45:38 - 18:45:41]
I'm hoping that this works again I

[18:45:39 - 18:45:42]
haven't put any credit card in here so

[18:45:41 - 18:45:44]
this would be really interesting might

[18:45:42 - 18:45:45]
be very limited but um if it works

[18:45:44 - 18:45:47]
that's good enough for me so we'll go

[18:45:45 - 18:45:50]
ahead and type in Python

[18:45:47 - 18:45:52]
Gemma piy and we'll go ahead and hit run

[18:45:50 - 18:45:55]
uh we get an error back minimum number

[18:45:52 - 18:45:57]
of items one invalid request um well I

[18:45:55 - 18:46:00]
did exactly what you told me to do so

[18:45:57 - 18:46:01]
I'm not sure as to what's wrong here um

[18:46:00 - 18:46:04]
but let's just carefully look at it and

[18:46:01 - 18:46:07]
see what could be wrong okay so we

[18:46:04 - 18:46:07]
scroll on

[18:46:07 - 18:46:13]
down um error code 400 so that's a bad

[18:46:11 - 18:46:15]
request minimum number of items one

[18:46:13 - 18:46:17]
invalid request so let's let's go take a

[18:46:15 - 18:46:18]
look here oh there's no messages so we

[18:46:17 - 18:46:21]
haven't passed any messages here so that

[18:46:18 - 18:46:22]
totally makes sense um I'm not sure what

[18:46:21 - 18:46:25]
it falls so I'm going to assume that

[18:46:22 - 18:46:28]
it's using roll so we have roll and

[18:46:25 - 18:46:29]
we'll just say um user and then I'll

[18:46:28 - 18:46:32]
just say

[18:46:29 - 18:46:32]
message

[18:46:33 - 18:46:38]
um

[18:46:35 - 18:46:40]
hello how are you today let's see if

[18:46:38 - 18:46:41]
that works we'll go ahead and hit up

[18:46:40 - 18:46:43]
again I'm just guessing the format and

[18:46:41 - 18:46:45]
so it says here the following must be

[18:46:43 - 18:46:48]
satisfied messages message is not

[18:46:45 - 18:46:49]
supported did you mean name okay so

[18:46:48 - 18:46:51]
clearly there is a very specific format

[18:46:49 - 18:46:54]
that it's looking for here um it doesn't

[18:46:51 - 18:46:57]
show us the example but we will go into

[18:46:54 - 18:46:59]
the gro API um and we'll find out what

[18:46:57 - 18:47:02]
it is so it's Ro and content as they are

[18:46:59 - 18:47:05]
showing here I might vary I'm not sure

[18:47:02 - 18:47:07]
if it's going to vary based on um API

[18:47:05 - 18:47:09]
but we'll go ahead and try

[18:47:07 - 18:47:11]
this it says as a large langage model I

[18:47:09 - 18:47:13]
don't have feelings so I've started

[18:47:11 - 18:47:15]
using this and wow is this fast this is

[18:47:13 - 18:47:17]
incredibly fast so I guess that's the

[18:47:15 - 18:47:18]
reason why um they say it's such a big

[18:47:17 - 18:47:20]
deal but you can see that there is some

[18:47:18 - 18:47:23]
open AI compatibility here it can do

[18:47:20 - 18:47:25]
text speech Vision but it's utilizing

[18:47:23 - 18:47:26]
open source models so if you're serious

[18:47:25 - 18:47:28]
about using open open source models I

[18:47:26 - 18:47:30]
guess that kind of makes sense it

[18:47:28 - 18:47:32]
clearly has Integrations to a lot of

[18:47:30 - 18:47:36]
different um uh tools and services over

[18:47:32 - 18:47:39]
here on the left hand side um I wonder

[18:47:36 - 18:47:41]
if it can do yeah I don't think so but I

[18:47:39 - 18:47:43]
was wondering if it could do um

[18:47:41 - 18:47:45]
structured structured Json but I don't

[18:47:43 - 18:47:50]
see that here maybe there's a way to do

[18:47:45 - 18:47:52]
it we type in like grock um grock uh

[18:47:50 - 18:47:55]
structure Json that could be really

[18:47:52 - 18:47:55]
interesting structured

[18:47:55 - 18:48:01]
output so I mean looks like there is

[18:47:57 - 18:48:01]
some stuff out here but I'm not

[18:48:01 - 18:48:06]
sure exactly how we do

[18:48:04 - 18:48:08]
it well it looks like it's has uh

[18:48:06 - 18:48:11]
response model so it seems like there is

[18:48:08 - 18:48:13]
some way to do um do that I'd be really

[18:48:11 - 18:48:15]
interested to see if that works as

[18:48:13 - 18:48:16]
that's always been a really large pain

[18:48:15 - 18:48:18]
point for us is doing structured output

[18:48:16 - 18:48:21]
so I'm going to go here and say new file

[18:48:18 - 18:48:24]
and just say structured structured. piy

[18:48:21 - 18:48:27]
and we will go ahead and grab this

[18:48:24 - 18:48:31]
example U it's using pantic which is

[18:48:27 - 18:48:31]
fine and I would just love to see it

[18:48:31 - 18:48:35]
work I was talking to George and he

[18:48:33 - 18:48:37]
knows a lot about structured output and

[18:48:35 - 18:48:39]
he's had a lot of trouble with it so if

[18:48:37 - 18:48:43]
he's having trouble with it then clearly

[18:48:39 - 18:48:45]
it's it's not a me problem it's a uh you

[18:48:43 - 18:48:46]
know you know what I'm saying it's a

[18:48:45 - 18:48:49]
it's just a hard thing to do but we'll

[18:48:46 - 18:48:50]
go over to here and we'll grab this

[18:48:49 - 18:48:53]
information I think we already have OS

[18:48:50 - 18:48:54]
imported but I'll go ahead and just take

[18:48:53 - 18:48:56]
this out I'm not sure what this

[18:48:54 - 18:48:58]
instructor is maybe that's the thing

[18:48:56 - 18:49:01]
that's doing it from grock

[18:48:58 - 18:49:02]
instructor um I'm not sure where we even

[18:49:01 - 18:49:05]
just got that last link so we'll say

[18:49:02 - 18:49:07]
grock structured output oh it is a from

[18:49:05 - 18:49:09]
instructor

[18:49:07 - 18:49:12]
okay structure the most popular library

[18:49:09 - 18:49:14]
for simple structured outputs oh did we

[18:49:12 - 18:49:15]
just find a cool library for structured

[18:49:14 - 18:49:17]
outputs

[18:49:15 - 18:49:19]
okay if this works I'll be pumped okay

[18:49:17 - 18:49:21]
we are totally taking a detour this

[18:49:19 - 18:49:22]
could be its own video but we are

[18:49:21 - 18:49:25]
dropping in here because I'm so darn

[18:49:22 - 18:49:26]
excited um so we have instructor here

[18:49:25 - 18:49:27]
I'm just going to split the screen here

[18:49:26 - 18:49:29]
and we're going to look at our

[18:49:27 - 18:49:31]
structured output so we have Gro I don't

[18:49:29 - 18:49:32]
I know what pantic is so we'll put that

[18:49:31 - 18:49:36]
in there it's a way of representing

[18:49:32 - 18:49:38]
structures of of python um typing I

[18:49:36 - 18:49:40]
think is part of pantic so I don't need

[18:49:38 - 18:49:42]
we we need to import those separately

[18:49:40 - 18:49:44]
let's go ahead and see if we can do the

[18:49:42 - 18:49:45]
requirements I don't know if the library

[18:49:44 - 18:49:48]
is literally called instructor but we're

[18:49:45 - 18:49:50]
going to try anyway um and let's go

[18:49:48 - 18:49:55]
ahead and see if we can run this we'll

[18:49:50 - 18:49:58]
do a pip sorry python structure

[18:49:55 - 18:50:01]
pi and we got structured

[18:49:58 - 18:50:03]
output wow okay I don't know how how to

[18:50:01 - 18:50:05]
tell you this but it's been so hard to

[18:50:03 - 18:50:09]
find a library for structured output the

[18:50:05 - 18:50:10]
question is what does this work with um

[18:50:09 - 18:50:12]
I mean if it works with open AI That's

[18:50:10 - 18:50:15]
great as well so it seems like it does

[18:50:12 - 18:50:16]
do that um

[18:50:15 - 18:50:18]
but it works with grock that really

[18:50:16 - 18:50:19]
opens the door for a lot of

[18:50:18 - 18:50:22]
opportunities for us so I was really

[18:50:19 - 18:50:23]
excited to find that just now um and

[18:50:22 - 18:50:25]
yeah maybe I'll make it a separate video

[18:50:23 - 18:50:28]
but there you go there's grock as you

[18:50:25 - 18:50:29]
can see it's super easy to use uh and

[18:50:28 - 18:50:32]
makes it so that you can use open source

[18:50:29 - 18:50:33]
models super fast let's just say grock

[18:50:32 - 18:50:36]
here I guess the question is how much

[18:50:33 - 18:50:37]
does grock cost as we were just using

[18:50:36 - 18:50:42]
the free

[18:50:37 - 18:50:45]
tier um we go to products here

[18:50:42 - 18:50:46]
pricing so

[18:50:45 - 18:50:50]
I don't know

[18:50:46 - 18:50:52]
um 25 million per tokens I mean it seems

[18:50:50 - 18:50:54]
very cost effective it looks like it's

[18:50:52 - 18:50:56]
doing it's not like you're loading up

[18:50:54 - 18:50:59]
credits but maybe you are

[18:50:56 - 18:51:03]
um it's pay as you

[18:50:59 - 18:51:07]
go I'm just trying to see here so we go

[18:51:03 - 18:51:10]
to how do we pay let's go to settings

[18:51:07 - 18:51:11]
billing pay per token so you scale up as

[18:51:10 - 18:51:16]
you

[18:51:11 - 18:51:18]
go okay so oh you can't can't do this so

[18:51:16 - 18:51:21]
you have free use low rate limits which

[18:51:18 - 18:51:23]
is fine pay per token so coming soon you

[18:51:21 - 18:51:26]
can't do that

[18:51:23 - 18:51:27]
yet um and then if you want to use you

[18:51:26 - 18:51:30]
got to pay it as a company so that's

[18:51:27 - 18:51:32]
really interesting I would have thought

[18:51:30 - 18:51:34]
that this would have been ready to go so

[18:51:32 - 18:51:36]
yeah once you get paer token this could

[18:51:34 - 18:51:38]
be a game changer at least for the open

[18:51:36 - 18:51:39]
source area but I guess right now you

[18:51:38 - 18:51:41]
just you get to use what you want to uh

[18:51:39 - 18:51:43]
you can utilize here in the grock cloud

[18:51:41 - 18:51:45]
so I guess that's what you get all right

[18:51:43 - 18:51:48]
see you around

[18:51:45 - 18:51:50]
[Music]

[18:51:48 - 18:51:52]
cow all right let's take a look at

[18:51:50 - 18:51:55]
replicate which by the way has the

[18:51:52 - 18:51:57]
coolest name ever I imagine it must be

[18:51:55 - 18:52:00]
inspired by Blade Runner but um

[18:51:57 - 18:52:04]
replicate is a place where if you want

[18:52:00 - 18:52:07]
to uh run projects uh like serve them up

[18:52:04 - 18:52:08]
similar to maybe say hugging face spaces

[18:52:07 - 18:52:11]
you can absolutely do that so if we go

[18:52:08 - 18:52:14]
here we can explore um a bunch of

[18:52:11 - 18:52:16]
different models and just use them right

[18:52:14 - 18:52:19]
so if you wanted to use flux then you

[18:52:16 - 18:52:21]
could go here and you could pay to have

[18:52:19 - 18:52:23]
uh to utilize it directly here uh via

[18:52:21 - 18:52:25]
here it also looks like they have an API

[18:52:23 - 18:52:28]
so a lot of these things are set up and

[18:52:25 - 18:52:30]
so you can install replicate API and use

[18:52:28 - 18:52:33]
these directly uh so they both have an

[18:52:30 - 18:52:35]
API playr like a playground and also an

[18:52:33 - 18:52:38]
API and then obviously you can implement

[18:52:35 - 18:52:40]
it in a various uh amount of formats and

[18:52:38 - 18:52:42]
they do have some free tier usage I

[18:52:40 - 18:52:44]
believe so let's go ahead and sign up

[18:52:42 - 18:52:46]
and I will just sign in with GitHub um

[18:52:44 - 18:52:48]
and we'll get going here with um here so

[18:52:46 - 18:52:49]
obviously I have an account for before

[18:52:48 - 18:52:51]
but let's go take a look at what we can

[18:52:49 - 18:52:52]
utilize for free because there are some

[18:52:51 - 18:52:55]
things that we can use for free and some

[18:52:52 - 18:52:57]
things that are paid um I really don't

[18:52:55 - 18:52:59]
care about this right now and let's go

[18:52:57 - 18:53:01]
over and explore and see what we can use

[18:52:59 - 18:53:04]
for free um because there must be

[18:53:01 - 18:53:05]
something we can use for free and I

[18:53:04 - 18:53:07]
imagine it's probably like featured

[18:53:05 - 18:53:10]
models because that way they are showing

[18:53:07 - 18:53:13]
them off um so let's take a look here

[18:53:10 - 18:53:14]
affordable and fast images let's go over

[18:53:13 - 18:53:17]
and take a look at this so here you can

[18:53:14 - 18:53:19]
see

[18:53:17 - 18:53:20]
0.022 so here I have to add payment to

[18:53:19 - 18:53:23]
utilize this one so I'm trying to find

[18:53:20 - 18:53:24]
one that I can use for free if I can't I

[18:53:23 - 18:53:25]
can add a credit card it's not that big

[18:53:24 - 18:53:27]
of a

[18:53:25 - 18:53:31]
deal

[18:53:27 - 18:53:32]
um but let's go to playground are these

[18:53:31 - 18:53:33]
the ones that are free a new way to

[18:53:32 - 18:53:35]
generate images and replicate the

[18:53:33 - 18:53:37]
playground encourages rapid fire

[18:53:35 - 18:53:39]
experimentation no so I still would have

[18:53:37 - 18:53:41]
to set up building I know I've used

[18:53:39 - 18:53:42]
things for free here so I'm just trying

[18:53:41 - 18:53:46]
to

[18:53:42 - 18:53:47]
find where we can do stuff for free if

[18:53:46 - 18:53:50]
we can it's not a big deal I can hook up

[18:53:47 - 18:53:53]
the credit card I just would love to um

[18:53:50 - 18:53:55]
uh show anything for free let's go over

[18:53:53 - 18:53:59]
to

[18:53:55 - 18:53:59]
[Music]

[18:53:59 - 18:54:03]
here yeah so maybe the free model is

[18:54:02 - 18:54:09]
just

[18:54:03 - 18:54:11]
gone okay replicate does it have a free

[18:54:09 - 18:54:12]
tier you can try featured models out

[18:54:11 - 18:54:15]
from replicate for free but after a bit

[18:54:12 - 18:54:17]
you'll be asked to uh set up billing

[18:54:15 - 18:54:19]
okay so maybe the reason that I can't

[18:54:17 - 18:54:21]
use the feature models anymore is that

[18:54:19 - 18:54:23]
I've had my account for too long let's

[18:54:21 - 18:54:25]
go over to our dashboard here um create

[18:54:23 - 18:54:27]
an account you can try featured models

[18:54:25 - 18:54:29]
out for free but after a bit we'll ask

[18:54:27 - 18:54:31]
you to set up billing okay so that's

[18:54:29 - 18:54:33]
what's happened here is that um they're

[18:54:31 - 18:54:34]
basically asking me to set up billing so

[18:54:33 - 18:54:36]
I guess I'm just going to have to do

[18:54:34 - 18:54:38]
that um and I'm going to go do that I'll

[18:54:36 - 18:54:42]
be back in just a moment okay all right

[18:54:38 - 18:54:44]
so I have a card hooked up and

[18:54:42 - 18:54:46]
um I mean it doesn't seem like there's a

[18:54:44 - 18:54:48]
way for me to manage my spend per se let

[18:54:46 - 18:54:50]
me see here yeah the way it looks like

[18:54:48 - 18:54:52]
it's just like you use so it's like oh

[18:54:50 - 18:54:53]
spend limit you can optionally specify a

[18:54:52 - 18:54:55]
month of spending limit once you reach

[18:54:53 - 18:54:57]
that limit will prevent new stuff here

[18:54:55 - 18:55:01]
so yeah I'll just say like $5 as my

[18:54:57 - 18:55:02]
limit here and so now I have that I wish

[18:55:01 - 18:55:04]
uh cloud service providers had that

[18:55:02 - 18:55:07]
that'd be really cool so now we have a

[18:55:04 - 18:55:09]
limit of $5 on here we'll go back and so

[18:55:07 - 18:55:11]
I guess the idea is that we can use uh

[18:55:09 - 18:55:13]
any of these things that we want to

[18:55:11 - 18:55:15]
utilize here so let's go over to models

[18:55:13 - 18:55:17]
um actually let's go to

[18:55:15 - 18:55:20]
explore and maybe there's something fun

[18:55:17 - 18:55:22]
that we can use so generate speech

[18:55:20 - 18:55:25]
generate with images make 3D

[18:55:22 - 18:55:26]
stuff um upscale images there's just

[18:55:25 - 18:55:28]
tons and tons of stuff in here that's

[18:55:26 - 18:55:30]
really

[18:55:28 - 18:55:33]
[Music]

[18:55:30 - 18:55:35]
cool yeah good

[18:55:33 - 18:55:37]
question I mean restore images sound

[18:55:35 - 18:55:39]
really cool but maybe we'll just do some

[18:55:37 - 18:55:42]
image generation here nothing

[18:55:39 - 18:55:45]
fancy so we have visual instruction uh

[18:55:42 - 18:55:47]
tuning towards large language models

[18:55:45 - 18:55:50]
okay what's the cost to use this

[18:55:47 - 18:55:53]
though so down below

[18:55:50 - 18:55:55]
here I can't even tell it doesn't

[18:55:53 - 18:55:57]
say before it was showing us the price

[18:55:55 - 18:55:59]
right there and so that was really

[18:55:57 - 18:56:02]
useful um but I guess we could just

[18:55:59 - 18:56:03]
utilize it here so visual instructions

[18:56:02 - 18:56:05]
tuning towards large models Vision

[18:56:03 - 18:56:07]
models with gp24 capabilities I don't

[18:56:05 - 18:56:10]
know if I like this one this one's not

[18:56:07 - 18:56:13]
as clear to utilizes other

[18:56:10 - 18:56:14]
ones uh I don't know okay maybe we'll

[18:56:13 - 18:56:16]
just be not so difficult about it so we

[18:56:14 - 18:56:18]
have output yes you are allowed to swim

[18:56:16 - 18:56:20]
in the lake to the image okay so this

[18:56:18 - 18:56:21]
one's actually looking at the image and

[18:56:20 - 18:56:24]
producing output I want to actually

[18:56:21 - 18:56:27]
generate an image so go back to

[18:56:24 - 18:56:29]
explore and here we'll just do this

[18:56:27 - 18:56:31]
affordable and fast one here and so it

[18:56:29 - 18:56:36]
says point0 2022 per image that's really

[18:56:31 - 18:56:40]
small here have a portrait photo 1024 by

[18:56:36 - 18:56:44]
1024 um we'll just say a portrait photo

[18:56:40 - 18:56:48]
of a raccoon or a black bear

[18:56:44 - 18:56:51]
okay and then we'll run

[18:56:48 - 18:56:53]
that and we will wait a mo a moment for

[18:56:51 - 18:56:55]
this to generate out and there we go so

[18:56:53 - 18:56:58]
we have a portrait of a Blackberry and

[18:56:55 - 18:56:59]
wow that is a really good uh output

[18:56:58 - 18:57:03]
there I actually I like that quite a bit

[18:56:59 - 18:57:04]
I'm going to drag that on over here um

[18:57:03 - 18:57:06]
but yeah as you can see that was very

[18:57:04 - 18:57:08]
very quick let's go over and check out

[18:57:06 - 18:57:08]
our

[18:57:09 - 18:57:14]
billing

[18:57:11 - 18:57:17]
okay and so far we can see the do 02

[18:57:14 - 18:57:18]
cents so that is uh really cool let's

[18:57:17 - 18:57:20]
see if we can work with this

[18:57:18 - 18:57:22]
programmatically and see how easy it is

[18:57:20 - 18:57:24]
to do that I imagine that this will be

[18:57:22 - 18:57:27]
as easy as working with

[18:57:24 - 18:57:30]
um uh you know whatever so I'm going to

[18:57:27 - 18:57:31]
go over to our geni

[18:57:30 - 18:57:33]
Essentials and let's see if we can

[18:57:31 - 18:57:35]
quickly add some code here I think I

[18:57:33 - 18:57:37]
saved the code last time I was here

[18:57:35 - 18:57:38]
right because I was working with Gro yes

[18:57:37 - 18:57:40]
so I did save it and I might still have

[18:57:38 - 18:57:44]
an environment up so I'm going to go

[18:57:40 - 18:57:45]
ahead and uh open this in the browser

[18:57:44 - 18:57:47]
I'm sure you've seen me launch GitHub

[18:57:45 - 18:57:51]
codes spaces multiple times if you do

[18:57:47 - 18:57:53]
not know how I got a course on it so I

[18:57:51 - 18:57:55]
got a course on everything um so we're

[18:57:53 - 18:57:57]
going to just open this up here and on

[18:57:55 - 18:58:01]
the left hand side I want to make a new

[18:57:57 - 18:58:01]
folder here which will be called

[18:58:02 - 18:58:08]
replicate okay and in here we will just

[18:58:05 - 18:58:12]
make a new file and this will just be

[18:58:08 - 18:58:16]
J.P and let's go over to here and let's

[18:58:12 - 18:58:20]
go get the API

[18:58:16 - 18:58:22]
here and so I want the python

[18:58:20 - 18:58:24]
example and I guess the first thing

[18:58:22 - 18:58:27]
we'll have to do is do uh install

[18:58:24 - 18:58:31]
replicate so I'll make a new uh

[18:58:27 - 18:58:35]
requirements.txt and this will be

[18:58:31 - 18:58:38]
um replicate uh we'll probably want

[18:58:35 - 18:58:40]
python. EnV as we keep utilizing that

[18:58:38 - 18:58:43]
and I'm going to CD into the replicate

[18:58:40 - 18:58:45]
direct directory we'll do a pip install

[18:58:43 - 18:58:47]
hyphen r

[18:58:45 - 18:58:50]
requirements.txt I'm going to go ahead

[18:58:47 - 18:58:53]
and make a EnV file here I'm also going

[18:58:50 - 18:58:58]
to go ahead and make a new umg

[18:58:53 - 18:59:00]
ignore get ignore as we want to ignore

[18:58:58 - 18:59:04]
ourv file so that's something that we

[18:59:00 - 18:59:06]
should obviously ignore dog ignore okay

[18:59:04 - 18:59:08]
let's make our way back over to here and

[18:59:06 - 18:59:11]
so we have this key in particular I'm

[18:59:08 - 18:59:12]
going to show it here on screen uh

[18:59:11 - 18:59:15]
hopefully it lets me delete these Keys

[18:59:12 - 18:59:16]
later on I'm not sure if it does do if

[18:59:15 - 18:59:19]
it doesn't that'd be really

[18:59:16 - 18:59:22]
annoying so yeah I wonder how it manages

[18:59:19 - 18:59:24]
keys well we made that key earlier right

[18:59:22 - 18:59:26]
if I if I go check my API

[18:59:24 - 18:59:28]
tokens yes yes so we generate that one

[18:59:26 - 18:59:31]
out so I will rotate that out after this

[18:59:28 - 18:59:33]
video um and so I'm going to go ahead

[18:59:31 - 18:59:36]
and just clear this out like

[18:59:33 - 18:59:39]
this and then we will wrap it as

[18:59:36 - 18:59:43]
such okay not sure if we have to um and

[18:59:39 - 18:59:44]
so we did our install over here I'm

[18:59:43 - 18:59:47]
going to go back over

[18:59:44 - 18:59:51]
to uh our code and so it's suggesting

[18:59:47 - 18:59:51]
that this is all we need to work with

[18:59:51 - 18:59:55]
it okay so it looks pretty

[18:59:53 - 18:59:56]
straightforward the only thing that

[18:59:55 - 18:59:58]
we're missing is loading in the

[18:59:56 - 19:00:01]
environment variables so I'll go down to

[18:59:58 - 19:00:03]
our streamlet example which has uh these

[19:00:01 - 19:00:06]
two lines and I'll go grab those we'll

[19:00:03 - 19:00:08]
go back over to our gen. piy and I'll

[19:00:06 - 19:00:10]
just paste those two lines in there and

[19:00:08 - 19:00:12]
let's go ahead and see if this works so

[19:00:10 - 19:00:15]
we'll do

[19:00:12 - 19:00:20]
um uh python

[19:00:15 - 19:00:20]
python uh gen.

[19:00:22 - 19:00:30]
piy and so it works and now we have our

[19:00:27 - 19:00:31]
output there we go now we didn't change

[19:00:30 - 19:00:33]
any of the default parameters so it

[19:00:31 - 19:00:39]
clearly went based on that so we say a

[19:00:33 - 19:00:39]
portrait a photo of a uh doc

[19:00:42 - 19:00:46]
hund so that's the kind dog that I

[19:00:47 - 19:00:53]
have a short haired doxin and we're

[19:00:51 - 19:00:56]
going to try this one more time I'm

[19:00:53 - 19:00:56]
going to delete the output

[19:00:56 - 19:01:00]
here did a really good job

[19:01:04 - 19:01:10]
though so I'll wait a moment for this to

[19:01:07 - 19:01:13]
generate so we'll go over to

[19:01:10 - 19:01:17]
here uh kind of looks like my dog

[19:01:13 - 19:01:19]
my dog's a bit fatter so I'll just say a

[19:01:17 - 19:01:22]
short-haired fat

[19:01:19 - 19:01:24]
doxin and now let's see what if it gets

[19:01:22 - 19:01:24]
even

[19:01:28 - 19:01:34]
closer okay and so we'll go back over to

[19:01:32 - 19:01:36]
here yeah so that's kind of looking like

[19:01:34 - 19:01:38]
my dog actually so my dog again my dog's

[19:01:36 - 19:01:40]
a bit fatter than that but you know

[19:01:38 - 19:01:42]
that's a kind of an example of of that

[19:01:40 - 19:01:44]
generation out there uh so very very

[19:01:42 - 19:01:45]
similar um and so yeah we have our

[19:01:44 - 19:01:47]
example works great we'll go ahead and

[19:01:45 - 19:01:49]
say replicate yeah you can just see how

[19:01:47 - 19:01:51]
replicate could just make it really easy

[19:01:49 - 19:01:53]
if you had very specific services that

[19:01:51 - 19:01:55]
you wanted to utilize um it's just dead

[19:01:53 - 19:01:58]
simple I'm going to go ahead and get rid

[19:01:55 - 19:02:01]
of my API token key and we'll go ahead

[19:01:58 - 19:02:04]
and just delete that or disable it I

[19:02:01 - 19:02:08]
suppose and uh yeah there you go that's

[19:02:04 - 19:02:10]
[Music]

[19:02:08 - 19:02:11]
replicate hey everybody it's Andrew

[19:02:10 - 19:02:13]
Brown we're going to be taking a look at

[19:02:11 - 19:02:15]
Cloud flare as they do have an AI

[19:02:13 - 19:02:20]
offering um I believe they have a vector

[19:02:15 - 19:02:22]
database and also means to deploy um uh

[19:02:20 - 19:02:23]
open source AI models and so I would

[19:02:22 - 19:02:25]
love to take a look at that and figure

[19:02:23 - 19:02:28]
out if we can figure it out together as

[19:02:25 - 19:02:29]
Cloud flare is super fast um and I hear

[19:02:28 - 19:02:31]
that they have really good pricing we

[19:02:29 - 19:02:32]
might go compare that here but I'm going

[19:02:31 - 19:02:34]
to get my head out of the way I'm going

[19:02:32 - 19:02:36]
to log in you would have to create a

[19:02:34 - 19:02:39]
cloudflare account first and also hook

[19:02:36 - 19:02:41]
up your credit card um I do not believe

[19:02:39 - 19:02:43]
uh that I'm in the free tier or I would

[19:02:41 - 19:02:44]
not imagine that these are the free tier

[19:02:43 - 19:02:46]
but we'll take a look here and see what

[19:02:44 - 19:02:48]
we have so under their AI category on

[19:02:46 - 19:02:50]
the left hand side we have worker AIS

[19:02:48 - 19:02:51]
Vector eyes and AI Gateway you can see

[19:02:50 - 19:02:53]
they have a bunch of other services as

[19:02:51 - 19:02:55]
well so they're definitely growing as a

[19:02:53 - 19:02:57]
company maybe one day they'll be like a

[19:02:55 - 19:02:59]
cloud service provider um just like AWS

[19:02:57 - 19:03:03]
but right now I would call them a cloud

[19:02:59 - 19:03:04]
um a uh a cloud platform with a lot of

[19:03:03 - 19:03:06]
cool stuff here but let's take a look at

[19:03:04 - 19:03:09]
the first here so it says welcome to

[19:03:06 - 19:03:10]
worker AI workers AI so offers a catalog

[19:03:09 - 19:03:13]
of AI inference models that you can

[19:03:10 - 19:03:17]
access from a worker or via a rest API

[19:03:13 - 19:03:18]
so work sounds like uh compute to me um

[19:03:17 - 19:03:21]
let's go find out what that is just one

[19:03:18 - 19:03:23]
second here we go so Cloud workers

[19:03:21 - 19:03:25]
provides a serverless execution

[19:03:23 - 19:03:26]
environment that allows you to create

[19:03:25 - 19:03:28]
new applications so it literally sounds

[19:03:26 - 19:03:30]
like kind of like Azure functions but it

[19:03:28 - 19:03:34]
just sounds like uh like compute it's

[19:03:30 - 19:03:37]
just it's just serverless compute um so

[19:03:34 - 19:03:39]
here we have uh some stuff below and it

[19:03:37 - 19:03:42]
looks like we can uh build and deploy a

[19:03:39 - 19:03:44]
llama 3 worker llama 3.21 billion would

[19:03:42 - 19:03:46]
be really nice to deploy and then we can

[19:03:44 - 19:03:47]
use the rest API that's very clear we

[19:03:46 - 19:03:49]
also have some examples down below which

[19:03:47 - 19:03:51]
is really cool speech to text would be

[19:03:49 - 19:03:53]
really sweet I wonder if that would use

[19:03:51 - 19:03:55]
open whisper as I really do like open

[19:03:53 - 19:03:57]
whisper um so I'm opening this up in

[19:03:55 - 19:04:00]
another tab here I'm not sure if we can

[19:03:57 - 19:04:02]
open it this way and this one is using

[19:04:00 - 19:04:04]
it is using open AI whisper so that

[19:04:02 - 19:04:06]
could be a very specific use case that I

[19:04:04 - 19:04:08]
would like to use however I'm not sure

[19:04:06 - 19:04:10]
how easy would be to provide the the the

[19:04:08 - 19:04:14]
code samples actually there is one right

[19:04:10 - 19:04:17]
here uh which is being served up from um

[19:04:14 - 19:04:18]
oh using an example from Azure okay so

[19:04:17 - 19:04:21]
we could do that maybe we'll just stick

[19:04:18 - 19:04:23]
with text for now as it might be hard to

[19:04:21 - 19:04:25]
build something with a microphone

[19:04:23 - 19:04:27]
capture but let's go back up to here and

[19:04:25 - 19:04:30]
I think what I'm interested in is llama

[19:04:27 - 19:04:33]
3.2 so I'm just curious because we have

[19:04:30 - 19:04:34]
models down here below let go expand it

[19:04:33 - 19:04:38]
and let's go into text

[19:04:34 - 19:04:40]
generation and I mean Gemma is good as

[19:04:38 - 19:04:42]
well but just because I've been using

[19:04:40 - 19:04:44]
llama 3.2 as a baseline I think we'll

[19:04:42 - 19:04:47]
stick with it so let's go with the 1

[19:04:44 - 19:04:49]
billion parameter one here and we can

[19:04:47 - 19:04:51]
see it here so launch the El a

[19:04:49 - 19:04:53]
playground try out the model with the

[19:04:51 - 19:04:54]
workers a on playground let's check out

[19:04:53 - 19:04:57]
that

[19:04:54 - 19:04:59]
first okay so it's just a playground

[19:04:57 - 19:05:00]
that's cool so hello how are you doing I

[19:04:59 - 19:05:02]
didn't know they had a playground that's

[19:05:00 - 19:05:04]
really cool um hold on here but we'll go

[19:05:02 - 19:05:07]
here and just say hello I need help uh

[19:05:04 - 19:05:10]
studying uh Japanese it's not going to

[19:05:07 - 19:05:10]
be very good at this we'll give it a

[19:05:11 - 19:05:15]
go there we go and the assistant replies

[19:05:14 - 19:05:17]
and so it has a little bit of a

[19:05:15 - 19:05:19]
different interface but we do have some

[19:05:17 - 19:05:21]
options here we don't have tons but if

[19:05:19 - 19:05:23]
we go over here we do have uh the code

[19:05:21 - 19:05:25]
if we wanted to utilize this so you can

[19:05:23 - 19:05:27]
deploy the following code deploy a

[19:05:25 - 19:05:31]
workers AI worker using the current

[19:05:27 - 19:05:33]
playgrounds message settings okay so we

[19:05:31 - 19:05:35]
do have code but the question is how

[19:05:33 - 19:05:38]
could we go about deploying

[19:05:35 - 19:05:40]
this H good question so let's go back

[19:05:38 - 19:05:42]
here for a second because up

[19:05:40 - 19:05:44]
here I bet if we press this it would

[19:05:42 - 19:05:46]
automatically started deployment not

[19:05:44 - 19:05:47]
necessarily oh we do have a deploy down

[19:05:46 - 19:05:49]
here

[19:05:47 - 19:05:51]
below but I'm just wondering like if I

[19:05:49 - 19:05:52]
want to do a custom deploy how would I

[19:05:51 - 19:05:55]
do it so obviously I could press this

[19:05:52 - 19:05:55]
button let's go ahead and try

[19:05:56 - 19:06:00]
that and that's going to perform a

[19:05:59 - 19:06:02]
deployment it says it's actually telling

[19:06:00 - 19:06:03]
us where it's going to deploy which is

[19:06:02 - 19:06:06]
up

[19:06:03 - 19:06:07]
here okay and that was really fast I

[19:06:06 - 19:06:10]
cannot imagine that it's ready for

[19:06:07 - 19:06:14]
inference that quickly but it is really

[19:06:10 - 19:06:15]
interesting how quick it was um

[19:06:14 - 19:06:18]
I mean obviously I would like to deploy

[19:06:15 - 19:06:19]
the project locally for sure um install

[19:06:18 - 19:06:23]
Wrangler I don't even know what Wrangler

[19:06:19 - 19:06:25]
is let's go take a look here Wrangler is

[19:06:23 - 19:06:27]
what maybe it's just the name of their

[19:06:25 - 19:06:28]
it's their command line tool for

[19:06:27 - 19:06:30]
building Cloud for workers okay so maybe

[19:06:28 - 19:06:32]
this is the way we would actually build

[19:06:30 - 19:06:35]
a worker so MPX Wrangler init my worker

[19:06:32 - 19:06:38]
so we'll set up a new worker and we have

[19:06:35 - 19:06:40]
some configuration and we have

[19:06:38 - 19:06:42]
development deployment so it seems like

[19:06:40 - 19:06:43]
this is how we would do it and probably

[19:06:42 - 19:06:45]
we would specify that code block and

[19:06:43 - 19:06:47]
that's maybe how it would know to do it

[19:06:45 - 19:06:49]
we'll come back to that in a moment um

[19:06:47 - 19:06:54]
as right now we just want to deploy this

[19:06:49 - 19:06:57]
llama 3.2 template um I'll go back here

[19:06:54 - 19:06:59]
as I've lost the page but that's

[19:06:57 - 19:07:00]
okay and the back works we'll continue

[19:06:59 - 19:07:02]
over to the

[19:07:00 - 19:07:05]
project um and so here it's under the

[19:07:02 - 19:07:07]
workers and workers and pages and so if

[19:07:05 - 19:07:08]
we can go back into here over here on

[19:07:07 - 19:07:11]
the right hand side we have My Account

[19:07:08 - 19:07:13]
Details again I'm not sure uh I think

[19:07:11 - 19:07:16]
I'm unpage here so just you know be

[19:07:13 - 19:07:18]
aware of that so down below here we can

[19:07:16 - 19:07:20]
see our version track

[19:07:18 - 19:07:21]
history so a minute ago and then last

[19:07:20 - 19:07:22]
minute ago I'm not sure what the

[19:07:21 - 19:07:25]
difference is but maybe they're just

[19:07:22 - 19:07:27]
showing commits over time uh I can't

[19:07:25 - 19:07:28]
click onto anything there as of yet so

[19:07:27 - 19:07:30]
these are not accessible which is

[19:07:28 - 19:07:32]
totally fine maybe because I never

[19:07:30 - 19:07:33]
really hooked this up to a real GitHub

[19:07:32 - 19:07:35]
repo because this is the the build

[19:07:33 - 19:07:38]
history and so I imagine it has to be

[19:07:35 - 19:07:39]
linked maybe to a GitHub repo I'm not

[19:07:38 - 19:07:41]
sure but we can deploy different

[19:07:39 - 19:07:44]
versions if we need to then up here we

[19:07:41 - 19:07:46]
have our deployment m and so I guess my

[19:07:44 - 19:07:47]
question is like it's deployed I'm not

[19:07:46 - 19:07:49]
sure what the code looks like that's

[19:07:47 - 19:07:51]
totally fine let's go over here and edit

[19:07:49 - 19:07:53]
the

[19:07:51 - 19:07:55]
code okay and so I can imagine that this

[19:07:53 - 19:07:57]
is literally the code that's been

[19:07:55 - 19:07:59]
deployed and if this is like workers

[19:07:57 - 19:08:00]
then this is our single line file that

[19:07:59 - 19:08:02]
we say that we

[19:08:00 - 19:08:04]
have

[19:08:02 - 19:08:07]
okay oh this is trying to make sense

[19:08:04 - 19:08:09]
okay okay okay so basically what this

[19:08:07 - 19:08:12]
feels like it feels like kind of like uh

[19:08:09 - 19:08:14]
Azure functions or or uh itus lambdas

[19:08:12 - 19:08:17]
and it probably already has these

[19:08:14 - 19:08:18]
libraries pre-loaded we have EMV aai run

[19:08:17 - 19:08:19]
and so we're literally just calling them

[19:08:18 - 19:08:21]
and then we can just start working with

[19:08:19 - 19:08:23]
it and so the idea is that it already

[19:08:21 - 19:08:26]
has an endpoint that's accessible over

[19:08:23 - 19:08:27]
here that we can utilize um and here it

[19:08:26 - 19:08:29]
looks like they already actually have

[19:08:27 - 19:08:32]
some um output for it input so we say

[19:08:29 - 19:08:34]
prompt tell me a joke response here's

[19:08:32 - 19:08:37]
one etc etc and it's outputting that

[19:08:34 - 19:08:38]
there I didn't tell it to open up um

[19:08:37 - 19:08:40]
this here I didn't know you could embed

[19:08:38 - 19:08:42]
it like that but that's really cool but

[19:08:40 - 19:08:44]
I guess my question is like if I wanted

[19:08:42 - 19:08:46]
to use this myself how would I go about

[19:08:44 - 19:08:48]
doing

[19:08:46 - 19:08:50]
that okay so I'm just again going

[19:08:48 - 19:08:52]
through this and taking a look here so

[19:08:50 - 19:08:54]
probably what I could do is produce my

[19:08:52 - 19:08:57]
own

[19:08:54 - 19:09:00]
curl I mean this looks kind of like the

[19:08:57 - 19:09:01]
workload similarly what would I want but

[19:09:00 - 19:09:03]
how would we go about triggering this

[19:09:01 - 19:09:06]
also looks like O Okay so that's the

[19:09:03 - 19:09:07]
developer stuff that we had before so

[19:09:06 - 19:09:10]
build preview deploy your workers from

[19:09:07 - 19:09:10]
Wrangler command line

[19:09:11 - 19:09:15]
interface okay so I think what this is

[19:09:13 - 19:09:18]
is doing it's initializing a new project

[19:09:15 - 19:09:19]
based on this already existing project

[19:09:18 - 19:09:21]
so maybe that's something we might want

[19:09:19 - 19:09:23]
to do to to bring it down to the ground

[19:09:21 - 19:09:25]
and then we can push it to our own repo

[19:09:23 - 19:09:28]
so I'm just deciding I'm going to open

[19:09:25 - 19:09:31]
up vs code let's give this a

[19:09:28 - 19:09:33]
go and I have obviously a random project

[19:09:31 - 19:09:35]
open here on the left hand side it's not

[19:09:33 - 19:09:37]
random it's all of our Japanese language

[19:09:35 - 19:09:39]
learning stuff but we'll go over to here

[19:09:37 - 19:09:44]
we'll make a new terminal I'm going to

[19:09:39 - 19:09:46]
drag this up okay and um I don't don't

[19:09:44 - 19:09:49]
have that installed so I wonder if I

[19:09:46 - 19:09:52]
have to install the the Wrangler CLI

[19:09:49 - 19:09:52]
first let's drag this over

[19:09:54 - 19:09:57]
here I'm not sure but I'm just going to

[19:09:56 - 19:10:00]
take it

[19:09:57 - 19:10:02]
anyway I'm going to CD into my sites

[19:10:00 - 19:10:04]
director wherever you want to place

[19:10:02 - 19:10:06]
that because I think MPX will actually

[19:10:04 - 19:10:08]
pick this up like it will know like

[19:10:06 - 19:10:10]
whatever it wants to be will do so it

[19:10:08 - 19:10:13]
says need to install the following

[19:10:10 - 19:10:17]
package create Cloud flare sure what

[19:10:13 - 19:10:17]
does create Cloud flare let's go back

[19:10:18 - 19:10:22]
here create

[19:10:23 - 19:10:27]
cloudflare uh

[19:10:31 - 19:10:35]
CI okay so it says here CL provides a c

[19:10:34 - 19:10:38]
command for creating workers and uh

[19:10:35 - 19:10:41]
workers and Pages project mpm crate

[19:10:38 - 19:10:43]
Cloud Powered By The Crate Cloud package

[19:10:41 - 19:10:45]
so yeah I'm just not sure if that is the

[19:10:43 - 19:10:46]
same package or if it's a slightly

[19:10:45 - 19:10:49]
different package this might be a

[19:10:46 - 19:10:51]
specialized one Wrangler version 2 is

[19:10:49 - 19:10:54]
only receiving critical security updates

[19:10:51 - 19:10:55]
we recommend migrating to Wrangler 3 so

[19:10:54 - 19:10:57]
there might be some overlap I mean this

[19:10:55 - 19:11:00]
is not uncommon like eight of us will

[19:10:57 - 19:11:01]
have um CIS that do the same thing but

[19:11:00 - 19:11:02]
over here what do we have we have in

[19:11:01 - 19:11:06]
which directory would you like to create

[19:11:02 - 19:11:08]
the app um oh okay

[19:11:06 - 19:11:09]
um I mean I didn't choose any of these

[19:11:08 - 19:11:11]
things it looks like it is working

[19:11:09 - 19:11:15]
through

[19:11:11 - 19:11:17]
it I mean all that stuff is fine

[19:11:15 - 19:11:18]
fine I guess because it's an existing

[19:11:17 - 19:11:21]
project probably it's it's just

[19:11:18 - 19:11:22]
defaulting to what already is there and

[19:11:21 - 19:11:24]
so it's just working through that right

[19:11:22 - 19:11:25]
now so we'll give it a moment for this

[19:11:24 - 19:11:28]
to complete I'll be back in just a

[19:11:25 - 19:11:30]
moment okay all right so it's installed

[19:11:28 - 19:11:33]
installed it now it's actually using MPX

[19:11:30 - 19:11:36]
Wrangler so clearly it is this is a

[19:11:33 - 19:11:38]
precursor to then set up maybe Wrangler

[19:11:36 - 19:11:40]
so probably what it did is it installed

[19:11:38 - 19:11:43]
Wrangler um and now it's doing quite a

[19:11:40 - 19:11:45]
bit of work so we're going to let it

[19:11:43 - 19:11:47]
want really love this uh this experience

[19:11:45 - 19:11:50]
it's really really nice and so it's

[19:11:47 - 19:11:53]
opened up on Port 87 9 etc etc whatever

[19:11:50 - 19:11:54]
it said so I guess we are just giving

[19:11:53 - 19:11:56]
access to Wrangler to my account and

[19:11:54 - 19:11:57]
that's absolutely what we're doing so

[19:11:56 - 19:12:01]
we've granted access I'm going to make

[19:11:57 - 19:12:04]
my way back over to vs code um over to

[19:12:01 - 19:12:06]
here okay and so it should know that we

[19:12:04 - 19:12:06]
have logged in

[19:12:10 - 19:12:14]
now sometimes logging can mess up but

[19:12:12 - 19:12:16]
it's okay

[19:12:14 - 19:12:17]
okay we'll just close that I don't think

[19:12:16 - 19:12:19]
it's required but the point is is that

[19:12:17 - 19:12:21]
we have

[19:12:19 - 19:12:23]
authenticated but we'll give it a moment

[19:12:21 - 19:12:24]
here it might be

[19:12:23 - 19:12:27]
stuck

[19:12:24 - 19:12:29]
okay so I'll just pause here and wait

[19:12:27 - 19:12:31]
there we go so it did eventually work

[19:12:29 - 19:12:33]
which is great um so we we did Wrangler

[19:12:31 - 19:12:34]
log in it logged in as my account not

[19:12:33 - 19:12:36]
sure why I capitalized the a but that's

[19:12:34 - 19:12:38]
totally fine um it downloads existing

[19:12:36 - 19:12:40]
worker files do you want to use G

[19:12:38 - 19:12:42]
absolutely yes we'll hit enter it's

[19:12:40 - 19:12:44]
really interesting that the interface is

[19:12:42 - 19:12:45]
like so Advanced here in the terminal

[19:12:44 - 19:12:47]
though I'm not sure how that would work

[19:12:45 - 19:12:48]
if you were working on a remote server

[19:12:47 - 19:12:51]
probably would still work and so we have

[19:12:48 - 19:12:53]
our application successfully created

[19:12:51 - 19:12:54]
locally um it's telling us if we want to

[19:12:53 - 19:12:59]
change directories of course we would

[19:12:54 - 19:12:59]
love to do that so go ahead and do

[19:12:59 - 19:13:04]
this we have mpm run start so start a

[19:13:02 - 19:13:06]
developer server I'm not exactly sure

[19:13:04 - 19:13:08]
how this would work because we are

[19:13:06 - 19:13:11]
running AI but I guess if they're

[19:13:08 - 19:13:14]
inferring their own serverless like the

[19:13:11 - 19:13:16]
runtime itself is probably not

[19:13:14 - 19:13:18]
containing the Llama runtime they

[19:13:16 - 19:13:19]
probably have other servers that are

[19:13:18 - 19:13:22]
connecting to

[19:13:19 - 19:13:24]
it and that would explain why the

[19:13:22 - 19:13:27]
deployment so fast also that could also

[19:13:24 - 19:13:29]
explain if it is only uh based on what

[19:13:27 - 19:13:31]
you use as opposed to time running which

[19:13:29 - 19:13:33]
we'll find out here in a moment we do

[19:13:31 - 19:13:35]
have mpm Run start and mpm run deploy

[19:13:33 - 19:13:38]
something that's really hard over at

[19:13:35 - 19:13:40]
least in uh ad Us and other places aure

[19:13:38 - 19:13:42]
and Google included is local development

[19:13:40 - 19:13:44]
so this if this is like lambdas but they

[19:13:42 - 19:13:46]
just do mpm run start it works that' be

[19:13:44 - 19:13:49]
really really amazing um we'll go down

[19:13:46 - 19:13:51]
here uh below and I actually just want

[19:13:49 - 19:13:53]
to reopen this into vs code so we can

[19:13:51 - 19:13:55]
take a look at what our code sample

[19:13:53 - 19:13:57]
looks like and so we've opened a new vs

[19:13:55 - 19:13:58]
code project here I still want to keep

[19:13:57 - 19:14:00]
this one around so we'll just move it

[19:13:58 - 19:14:00]
out of the

[19:14:01 - 19:14:06]
way okay and we'll bring it on down here

[19:14:05 - 19:14:09]
and let's see what we have so we have a

[19:14:06 - 19:14:11]
package.json file okay that's pretty

[19:14:09 - 19:14:15]
straightforward I'm curious what it's

[19:14:11 - 19:14:18]
installed uh um just Wrangler okay so

[19:14:15 - 19:14:21]
just Wrangler that's really nice we have

[19:14:18 - 19:14:23]
an index.js file so yeah looks like a

[19:14:21 - 19:14:25]
function a really easy function request

[19:14:23 - 19:14:27]
environment yeah absolutely like a a a

[19:14:25 - 19:14:29]
servess function and then it's just

[19:14:27 - 19:14:32]
inferring from it so really that's all

[19:14:29 - 19:14:35]
there is we have a Wrangler dotl maybe

[19:14:32 - 19:14:37]
to provide some configuration here um

[19:14:35 - 19:14:40]
I'm not sure if if or why we need the

[19:14:37 - 19:14:42]
binding for AI but maybe if we don't

[19:14:40 - 19:14:44]
have that then the environment won't let

[19:14:42 - 19:14:46]
us use it looks like if we want to turn

[19:14:44 - 19:14:48]
observability it's just a a flip there

[19:14:46 - 19:14:50]
we're telling its entry point it would

[19:14:48 - 19:14:52]
be great if it could take Ruby I love

[19:14:50 - 19:14:54]
Ruby but if it's only JavaScript this is

[19:14:52 - 19:14:56]
totally fine uh when we're dealing with

[19:14:54 - 19:14:58]
like um serverless functions and they're

[19:14:56 - 19:15:01]
being deployed uh to remote edges

[19:14:58 - 19:15:03]
JavaScript seems to be uh the choice I'm

[19:15:01 - 19:15:05]
not sure why but there's probably a

[19:15:03 - 19:15:06]
technical reason for it so I can

[19:15:05 - 19:15:09]
understand why we might be limited to

[19:15:06 - 19:15:11]
just plain old JavaScript um but yeah

[19:15:09 - 19:15:13]
that's really really straightforward so

[19:15:11 - 19:15:15]
I don't feel like I need to change

[19:15:13 - 19:15:17]
anything here but I would like to figure

[19:15:15 - 19:15:19]
out how to actually test this and so I'm

[19:15:17 - 19:15:22]
going to open up a new terminal because

[19:15:19 - 19:15:25]
I believe that this is running uh

[19:15:22 - 19:15:26]
somewhere well it's on it runs online

[19:15:25 - 19:15:28]
but we're not running it locally and so

[19:15:26 - 19:15:30]
maybe that'd be interesting to try out

[19:15:28 - 19:15:32]
is to run this locally and so I'm going

[19:15:30 - 19:15:35]
to go ahead and type in MPN run

[19:15:32 - 19:15:36]
Dev and so that'll probably start on

[19:15:35 - 19:15:39]
some kind of

[19:15:36 - 19:15:40]
Port we'll give it a moment there while

[19:15:39 - 19:15:44]
that is starting I'm just going to go

[19:15:40 - 19:15:44]
ahead and open a new tab

[19:15:44 - 19:15:49]
okay and so it says CL collect some

[19:15:46 - 19:15:49]
information uh starting local server

[19:15:49 - 19:15:51]
open Dev

[19:15:49 - 19:15:54]
[Music]

[19:15:51 - 19:15:56]
tools I don't know let's go and hit Dev

[19:15:54 - 19:15:59]
tools I've never seen such Advanced

[19:15:56 - 19:16:01]
terminal terminal stuff it's really

[19:15:59 - 19:16:02]
impressive I'm hitting D but it's not

[19:16:01 - 19:16:05]
doing anything

[19:16:02 - 19:16:06]
so I'm not sure why I'm not really

[19:16:05 - 19:16:11]
worried about this part oh no it just

[19:16:06 - 19:16:13]
was delayed I was just impatient it's

[19:16:11 - 19:16:15]
working but the only thing is like right

[19:16:13 - 19:16:17]
now like this is not going to do

[19:16:15 - 19:16:18]
anything right oh it actually does okay

[19:16:17 - 19:16:22]
great

[19:16:18 - 19:16:26]
so they gave us back output

[19:16:22 - 19:16:26]
interesting uh this is developer

[19:16:26 - 19:16:29]
tools okay so I'm not exactly sure what

[19:16:28 - 19:16:32]
to do with that that I'm not really

[19:16:29 - 19:16:37]
interested in that what I want to know

[19:16:32 - 19:16:38]
is how do we do inference right so we

[19:16:37 - 19:16:40]
obviously have to send it a payload what

[19:16:38 - 19:16:42]
is it expecting let's see if we can

[19:16:40 - 19:16:46]
figure it out by just looking at it so

[19:16:42 - 19:16:49]
if we go here we can see that um we

[19:16:46 - 19:16:51]
already have a chat built into here

[19:16:49 - 19:16:53]
which looks like it's hardcoded because

[19:16:51 - 19:16:55]
we have system and user and so it's

[19:16:53 - 19:16:59]
already set up to give out a response so

[19:16:55 - 19:17:00]
you are a helpful assistant who won the

[19:16:59 - 19:17:04]
World

[19:17:00 - 19:17:06]
Series uh in 20 in 2020 right so if we

[19:17:04 - 19:17:08]
were to infer this even if we weren't to

[19:17:06 - 19:17:09]
uh send it any payload because it

[19:17:08 - 19:17:14]
doesn't appear to be including any

[19:17:09 - 19:17:16]
payload here it should um

[19:17:14 - 19:17:18]
well hold on a second hold on a second

[19:17:16 - 19:17:22]
because we have two things here we have

[19:17:18 - 19:17:25]
llama 3.8 instruct simple so simple uh

[19:17:22 - 19:17:26]
simple single conversational style input

[19:17:25 - 19:17:27]
and then we have chat so there's

[19:17:26 - 19:17:31]
actually two things that are going on in

[19:17:27 - 19:17:34]
here um so we go back to that uh over

[19:17:31 - 19:17:35]
here let's try D for developer tools I'm

[19:17:34 - 19:17:37]
just going to be patient here and wait

[19:17:35 - 19:17:39]
just a

[19:17:37 - 19:17:43]
moment I think what's that what that

[19:17:39 - 19:17:45]
will do is it will show us the output

[19:17:43 - 19:17:47]
nothing's opening so maybe it's maybe

[19:17:45 - 19:17:49]
it's B open a browser so I'm G to hit B

[19:17:47 - 19:17:51]
to open this in the

[19:17:49 - 19:17:54]
browser yeah so it's b d is not doing

[19:17:51 - 19:17:57]
anything for me that's totally

[19:17:54 - 19:18:00]
fine so we'll give it a moment

[19:17:57 - 19:18:02]
here and uh I think this is just built

[19:18:00 - 19:18:03]
into the browser and so here we have

[19:18:02 - 19:18:05]
inputs tell me a joke and here's the

[19:18:03 - 19:18:08]
response input systems your helpful

[19:18:05 - 19:18:09]
assistant you won the series okay so

[19:18:08 - 19:18:12]
basically they just have two different

[19:18:09 - 19:18:13]
examples is what we're seeing here right

[19:18:12 - 19:18:14]
um and so we might just want to narrow

[19:18:13 - 19:18:18]
this down and say okay I just want to

[19:18:14 - 19:18:20]
have one right so we'll do

[19:18:18 - 19:18:23]
this

[19:18:20 - 19:18:26]
and I don't need two so has tasks I

[19:18:23 - 19:18:31]
don't want two tasks I just want the

[19:18:26 - 19:18:32]
single input so I'll go here and we have

[19:18:31 - 19:18:34]
the response we have input

[19:18:32 - 19:18:38]
chat

[19:18:34 - 19:18:38]
response um do we

[19:18:39 - 19:18:44]
need the chat I mean we can output if we

[19:18:42 - 19:18:45]
want

[19:18:44 - 19:18:46]
but honestly I would just rather return

[19:18:45 - 19:18:48]
the

[19:18:46 - 19:18:49]
response so I wonder if I could just do

[19:18:48 - 19:18:53]
this

[19:18:49 - 19:18:56]
response like that and take that

[19:18:53 - 19:18:59]
out I'm going to save that notice that

[19:18:56 - 19:19:01]
the server is updating um and we can

[19:18:59 - 19:19:03]
still just go ahead and hit refresh here

[19:19:01 - 19:19:04]
and it should give us uh an error or it

[19:19:03 - 19:19:05]
should work we should just monitor it

[19:19:04 - 19:19:08]
here I'm not sure what happens when you

[19:19:05 - 19:19:11]
get errors with this it says response is

[19:19:08 - 19:19:13]
not defined that's totally fine so it's

[19:19:11 - 19:19:14]
possible because it's not a Jason object

[19:19:13 - 19:19:17]
it's complaining cuz it is trying to get

[19:19:14 - 19:19:21]
it from Jason right and that's a string

[19:19:17 - 19:19:21]
so I'll go here I'll just say um

[19:19:22 - 19:19:27]
response and we'll go ahead and wrap it

[19:19:25 - 19:19:30]
like that and so that might fix our

[19:19:27 - 19:19:32]
issue again I don't know any of this

[19:19:30 - 19:19:34]
this my first time using Cloud flare

[19:19:32 - 19:19:36]
workers specifically with AI I mean I

[19:19:34 - 19:19:38]
have used Cloud flare it's just been a

[19:19:36 - 19:19:39]
while um and so at least it's telling us

[19:19:38 - 19:19:43]
exactly where the are is so response is

[19:19:39 - 19:19:45]
not defined it's still an issue here

[19:19:43 - 19:19:48]
um I'm not sure why that's a problem

[19:19:45 - 19:19:52]
like it's clearly defined right there

[19:19:48 - 19:19:52]
right okay so let let me just undo for a

[19:19:59 - 19:20:07]
moment okay

[19:20:03 - 19:20:09]
so yeah I want to take this one out of

[19:20:07 - 19:20:11]
here and we have inputs chat response

[19:20:09 - 19:20:14]
let's just take out one for now and see

[19:20:11 - 19:20:16]
what happens cuz this one should work

[19:20:14 - 19:20:18]
right I want to just pair this down to

[19:20:16 - 19:20:20]
the minimal the minimal stuff that we

[19:20:18 - 19:20:24]
need

[19:20:20 - 19:20:27]
here and now it's saying response is not

[19:20:24 - 19:20:28]
defined but it is so I don't really

[19:20:27 - 19:20:30]
trust what it's saying here so I'm going

[19:20:28 - 19:20:31]
to stop the server start it back again

[19:20:30 - 19:20:32]
because clearly well you know what it

[19:20:31 - 19:20:34]
doesn't have lead in front of it that's

[19:20:32 - 19:20:36]
the problem I think it's because the

[19:20:34 - 19:20:37]
previous one was defined and that and

[19:20:36 - 19:20:39]
then we overrode it and that's why it's

[19:20:37 - 19:20:40]
not working correctly so I'm going to go

[19:20:39 - 19:20:43]
back over here and I just have more

[19:20:40 - 19:20:45]
confidence now that this might work

[19:20:43 - 19:20:47]
now I don't know if it needs to be

[19:20:45 - 19:20:48]
wrapped in adjacent objects so that

[19:20:47 - 19:20:50]
might be another problem but that error

[19:20:48 - 19:20:52]
is going to go away this

[19:20:50 - 19:20:53]
time if we just get back at string that

[19:20:52 - 19:20:56]
would be nice but we'll see what happens

[19:20:53 - 19:20:58]
here and we do so it just wraps it in

[19:20:56 - 19:21:01]
response and so that would be a very

[19:20:58 - 19:21:04]
simple way to get a response back um but

[19:21:01 - 19:21:06]
this right now is not super useful as we

[19:21:04 - 19:21:08]
don't really have any inputs um so what

[19:21:06 - 19:21:09]
I might do here is I'm just going to say

[19:21:08 - 19:21:11]
console log and I just want to console

[19:21:09 - 19:21:12]
log out the request I'm curious if it'll

[19:21:11 - 19:21:14]
actually show up down here I really

[19:21:12 - 19:21:16]
don't know if it would and I also want

[19:21:14 - 19:21:19]
to console log out uh the

[19:21:16 - 19:21:22]
EMV and I'm going to give this a query

[19:21:19 - 19:21:24]
string okay so we're going to go here

[19:21:22 - 19:21:27]
hello equals world I'm not sure if it

[19:21:24 - 19:21:30]
can handle query strings we'll give it a

[19:21:27 - 19:21:32]
try and we do get output so that's good

[19:21:30 - 19:21:35]
so if I scroll up here what I'm looking

[19:21:32 - 19:21:37]
for is where my hello world is so we

[19:21:35 - 19:21:38]
have URL this is the request I would

[19:21:37 - 19:21:40]
assume it' be in the

[19:21:38 - 19:21:46]
request um so we go here and we

[19:21:40 - 19:21:48]
carefully look here um we got host user

[19:21:46 - 19:21:50]
agent I mean maybe it doesn't take gets

[19:21:48 - 19:21:53]
maybe it only takes

[19:21:50 - 19:21:53]
posts

[19:21:54 - 19:22:00]
[Music]

[19:21:56 - 19:22:02]
um yeah I don't see

[19:22:00 - 19:22:03]
it but I'm sure that's not hard to

[19:22:02 - 19:22:05]
figure out we just need to figure out

[19:22:03 - 19:22:08]
how to pass something along there so

[19:22:05 - 19:22:14]
let's go back over to workers so

[19:22:08 - 19:22:14]
workers how to pass um parameters

[19:22:15 - 19:22:19]
Cloud flare it must be really easy to do

[19:22:17 - 19:22:21]
we could probably even ask um Chach PT

[19:22:19 - 19:22:21]
or

[19:22:23 - 19:22:26]
something all right let's see if we can

[19:22:25 - 19:22:27]
save ourselves some time we're going to

[19:22:26 - 19:22:30]
go over to chat GPT

[19:22:27 - 19:22:32]
here and I'm going to go ask here I'm

[19:22:30 - 19:22:36]
going to just say

[19:22:32 - 19:22:39]
um can you uh like I am

[19:22:36 - 19:22:39]
using cloudfire

[19:22:41 - 19:22:50]
workers how how do I pass

[19:22:44 - 19:22:52]
um uh parameters in a workload or in a

[19:22:50 - 19:22:54]
request to it because like one thing is

[19:22:52 - 19:22:56]
like how do I know it's Post in get

[19:22:54 - 19:22:58]
maybe it works with either poster get

[19:22:56 - 19:23:00]
because clearly it's using a get but

[19:22:58 - 19:23:01]
maybe it will work with the post I'm not

[19:23:00 - 19:23:04]
sure if you can use Query uh query

[19:23:01 - 19:23:06]
string parameters honestly I'd probably

[19:23:04 - 19:23:07]
want to do uh oh you can it says you can

[19:23:06 - 19:23:11]
do it

[19:23:07 - 19:23:13]
okay but how do we extract it

[19:23:11 - 19:23:15]
out so here if you're passing parameters

[19:23:13 - 19:23:19]
via query string you can parse them

[19:23:15 - 19:23:22]
using the native URL class in the

[19:23:19 - 19:23:22]
worker

[19:23:25 - 19:23:28]
okay well we are using query string I

[19:23:27 - 19:23:31]
mean it's probably not the most ideal

[19:23:28 - 19:23:35]
way to do it um we probably should be

[19:23:31 - 19:23:38]
utilizing post post

[19:23:35 - 19:23:39]
input okay so let's go take a look I'm

[19:23:38 - 19:23:40]
and I'm just going to try to bring this

[19:23:39 - 19:23:41]
code over I know you can't see it but

[19:23:40 - 19:23:44]
I'm going to just carefully look at it

[19:23:41 - 19:23:47]
here at for a moment so it looks like

[19:23:44 - 19:23:49]
you know they have this like ad event

[19:23:47 - 19:23:52]
weight whatever but it looks like they

[19:23:49 - 19:23:53]
have some kind of more um uh concise way

[19:23:52 - 19:23:54]
maybe this is older code and that's

[19:23:53 - 19:23:56]
maybe the way you used to do it or if

[19:23:54 - 19:23:59]
you're using older version of nodejs I'm

[19:23:56 - 19:24:01]
not sure um but the first thing is that

[19:23:59 - 19:24:04]
we should make sure that it's a post

[19:24:01 - 19:24:07]
that's not a bad idea so go

[19:24:04 - 19:24:11]
here um and I'm just going to go here

[19:24:07 - 19:24:11]
and say if post

[19:24:13 - 19:24:18]
and actually going to say if it's not

[19:24:17 - 19:24:21]
opposed

[19:24:18 - 19:24:22]
um I'm going to give it this response

[19:24:21 - 19:24:24]
now this probably not the best way to do

[19:24:22 - 19:24:25]
it there might be a way like to handle

[19:24:24 - 19:24:28]
errors or something but I'm just going

[19:24:25 - 19:24:31]
to do this send a post with Json

[19:24:28 - 19:24:32]
data um and so what we want here because

[19:24:31 - 19:24:35]
in the request apparently we can just

[19:24:32 - 19:24:37]
get the data this way

[19:24:35 - 19:24:40]
supposedly and then we could just say

[19:24:37 - 19:24:40]
data

[19:24:45 - 19:24:52]
okay um and so that's fine we're not

[19:24:48 - 19:24:53]
using tasks anymore so that's gone and

[19:24:52 - 19:24:56]
we

[19:24:53 - 19:24:57]
have uh we could also like expand our

[19:24:56 - 19:24:58]
data out this way so if there are

[19:24:57 - 19:25:02]
specific parameters like this we could

[19:24:58 - 19:25:04]
do this so all we would have here is uh

[19:25:02 - 19:25:10]
user input I

[19:25:04 - 19:25:10]
think and I would then put this here

[19:25:12 - 19:25:19]
I'd probably give it a better uh system

[19:25:14 - 19:25:21]
prompt here we'll just say uh give me

[19:25:19 - 19:25:24]
[Music]

[19:25:21 - 19:25:26]
another explain

[19:25:24 - 19:25:28]
what

[19:25:26 - 19:25:31]
this I'm trying to think of like

[19:25:28 - 19:25:33]
something it can do in a conversation so

[19:25:31 - 19:25:35]
um because we don't know what the first

[19:25:33 - 19:25:37]
I mean we do I'm saying we don't have an

[19:25:35 - 19:25:38]
interface to know what it is like what

[19:25:37 - 19:25:40]
we're saying to it and this is a chat

[19:25:38 - 19:25:42]
conversation I almost should have done

[19:25:40 - 19:25:45]
like chat completion here but uh we just

[19:25:42 - 19:25:49]
say uh well I'll just say help me learn

[19:25:45 - 19:25:52]
help me learn um you know Japanese uh

[19:25:49 - 19:25:56]
language help me with

[19:25:52 - 19:25:56]
Japanese language

[19:25:56 - 19:26:01]
learning I'm not sure if I spelled

[19:25:58 - 19:26:04]
language right I always spell that

[19:26:01 - 19:26:04]
wrong language

[19:26:10 - 19:26:12]
learning yep apparently I got a write

[19:26:11 - 19:26:16]
for

[19:26:12 - 19:26:17]
once so we're bringing that in there um

[19:26:16 - 19:26:19]
and so I'm hoping that this this works

[19:26:17 - 19:26:22]
here the only thing is that we need a

[19:26:19 - 19:26:24]
way of actually um doing inference

[19:26:22 - 19:26:25]
against this so I'm going to make a new

[19:26:24 - 19:26:30]
bin directory here and this is going to

[19:26:25 - 19:26:32]
be a bash script called um in uh uh like

[19:26:30 - 19:26:35]
infer or

[19:26:32 - 19:26:40]
test or chat how about it's just chat

[19:26:35 - 19:26:41]
okay um and so I need a curl command I

[19:26:40 - 19:26:44]
really don't want to write one from

[19:26:41 - 19:26:48]
scratch so just say uh you know can can

[19:26:44 - 19:26:51]
you give me a curl command which will go

[19:26:48 - 19:26:55]
to Local

[19:26:51 - 19:26:55]
Host uh what's going

[19:26:56 - 19:27:03]
to 878 I think it is is that what it is

[19:27:00 - 19:27:03]
what port do we

[19:27:03 - 19:27:09]
need oh now I've lost I got too many

[19:27:05 - 19:27:12]
windows open I'm just trying to find it

[19:27:09 - 19:27:17]
here here we are um and we're trying to

[19:27:12 - 19:27:19]
go to Port 878 8787

[19:27:17 - 19:27:22]
okay

[19:27:19 - 19:27:28]
8787 with a

[19:27:22 - 19:27:31]
payload of post uh for user input okay

[19:27:28 - 19:27:31]
let's see if it understands

[19:27:33 - 19:27:40]
that yeah that's basically what I want

[19:27:36 - 19:27:43]
um can you make it a bash script I just

[19:27:40 - 19:27:45]
can't remember the um shebang there's a

[19:27:43 - 19:27:47]
particular shebang that I like but we'll

[19:27:45 - 19:27:50]
take either or as long as it

[19:27:47 - 19:27:51]
works oh that's way too much code but um

[19:27:50 - 19:27:53]
we'll take some of it so I'll grab in

[19:27:51 - 19:27:58]
the shebang that's not the shebang that

[19:27:53 - 19:28:01]
I like but it probably will work and

[19:27:58 - 19:28:02]
um it actually lets us provide user

[19:28:01 - 19:28:05]
input which is actually kind of sweet I

[19:28:02 - 19:28:08]
kind of like that um you know what I am

[19:28:05 - 19:28:10]
going to take this whole script because

[19:28:08 - 19:28:12]
it kind of does what I want it's a

[19:28:10 - 19:28:14]
little bit verbose um maybe we can pair

[19:28:12 - 19:28:18]
it down here in just a

[19:28:14 - 19:28:21]
moment but like we have

[19:28:18 - 19:28:23]
um it gives an example of user input

[19:28:21 - 19:28:25]
which is

[19:28:23 - 19:28:26]
perfect and it has error handling we can

[19:28:25 - 19:28:29]
swap this out very easily which is

[19:28:26 - 19:28:32]
something we might want to do in just a

[19:28:29 - 19:28:34]
moment it prints out the payload or it

[19:28:32 - 19:28:38]
creates the Jason payload I

[19:28:34 - 19:28:38]
suppose it's passing it

[19:28:38 - 19:28:42]
here yeah I think it's fine okay so

[19:28:41 - 19:28:44]
we'll go back over to terminal here and

[19:28:42 - 19:28:46]
I'll go to this tab by the way if you

[19:28:44 - 19:28:49]
want to utilize this I will place this

[19:28:46 - 19:28:50]
in the repo so that uh you don't have to

[19:28:49 - 19:28:53]
try to re replicate this stuff you'll

[19:28:50 - 19:28:57]
just go to the um exampro

[19:28:53 - 19:29:02]
doco or sorry GitHub github.com exampro

[19:28:57 - 19:29:03]
exampro um uh gen Essentials and it'll

[19:29:02 - 19:29:05]
be in there okay so I've just made that

[19:29:03 - 19:29:08]
executable so that we can run it and so

[19:29:05 - 19:29:11]
this should try to do local inference um

[19:29:08 - 19:29:13]
I ran it and nothing happened so did it

[19:29:11 - 19:29:15]
work

[19:29:13 - 19:29:16]
because it didn't Echo out

[19:29:15 - 19:29:19]
anything

[19:29:16 - 19:29:23]
H okay so let me just go ahead and print

[19:29:19 - 19:29:27]
anything say Echo hello oh you know what

[19:29:23 - 19:29:30]
I didn't give it input so we'll just say

[19:29:27 - 19:29:35]
uh how do you

[19:29:30 - 19:29:37]
say eat in Japanese okay let's try this

[19:29:35 - 19:29:39]
missing user input

[19:29:37 - 19:29:42]
argument uhhuh are you sure about

[19:29:39 - 19:29:45]
that maybe we need to wrap it

[19:29:42 - 19:29:45]
parentheses let's try this

[19:29:48 - 19:29:53]
again if it does Works that'd be great

[19:29:50 - 19:29:55]
I'd be very happy with that it's running

[19:29:53 - 19:29:56]
slowly so I I imagine that maybe it's

[19:29:55 - 19:29:58]
trying to do some inference oh look it

[19:29:56 - 19:29:59]
actually does have it it's reloading the

[19:29:58 - 19:30:02]
local server so how do you say eat in

[19:29:59 - 19:30:04]
Japanese which is good I'm waiting for a

[19:30:02 - 19:30:06]
response from it but we're not getting

[19:30:04 - 19:30:09]
any response it's just hanging so it

[19:30:06 - 19:30:10]
makes me think that it's stuck right he

[19:30:09 - 19:30:12]
trying to do the curl and get that

[19:30:10 - 19:30:13]
response oh no there we go so it was

[19:30:12 - 19:30:16]
probably just generating it was just

[19:30:13 - 19:30:17]
taking time that makes sense so in

[19:30:16 - 19:30:19]
Japanese there are several ways to do it

[19:30:17 - 19:30:21]
so we've figured out how to implement it

[19:30:19 - 19:30:24]
this way let's say we wanted to deploy

[19:30:21 - 19:30:24]
that change so I imagine we just do mpm

[19:30:24 - 19:30:27]
run

[19:30:24 - 19:30:29]
deploy because I saw that

[19:30:27 - 19:30:30]
earlier and while that's deploying I'm

[19:30:29 - 19:30:33]
just going to exit this out and we'll go

[19:30:30 - 19:30:36]
back over to here and so we'll let that

[19:30:33 - 19:30:38]
deploy occur I'm not sure how fast it

[19:30:36 - 19:30:41]
deploys I'll just pause here and we'll

[19:30:38 - 19:30:42]
wait for this go a bit faster okay all

[19:30:41 - 19:30:44]
right so after few minutes it's deployed

[19:30:42 - 19:30:47]
and it's at this address so I think that

[19:30:44 - 19:30:49]
if we wanted to um uh test this worker

[19:30:47 - 19:30:52]
out I think we would just copy this

[19:30:49 - 19:30:55]
address here and I would go back over to

[19:30:52 - 19:30:58]
our chat and maybe what I could

[19:30:55 - 19:30:59]
do where this URL is I just SWA it out

[19:30:58 - 19:31:01]
here so do

[19:30:59 - 19:31:03]
URL

[19:31:01 - 19:31:05]
this okay and I'll just comment out the

[19:31:03 - 19:31:08]
first one and I'm going to go ahead and

[19:31:05 - 19:31:10]
try this again and so it should be

[19:31:08 - 19:31:12]
inferring

[19:31:10 - 19:31:15]
against um

[19:31:12 - 19:31:15]
that there we'll give it a

[19:31:20 - 19:31:25]
moment so now remember that this is

[19:31:24 - 19:31:27]
happening on the server so those other

[19:31:25 - 19:31:29]
things we had before here we wouldn't

[19:31:27 - 19:31:31]
see it here but here we got a response

[19:31:29 - 19:31:33]
and it clearly worked this is super easy

[19:31:31 - 19:31:34]
I can't believe how easy This was um but

[19:31:33 - 19:31:36]
you know what I'm interested in in

[19:31:34 - 19:31:38]
checking out is is do we have any

[19:31:36 - 19:31:40]
visibility or monitoring of what we've

[19:31:38 - 19:31:43]
done here so we'll go back over to here

[19:31:40 - 19:31:44]
and we'll go to

[19:31:43 - 19:31:46]
here okay and I want to look at this

[19:31:44 - 19:31:49]
workload in

[19:31:46 - 19:31:51]
particular now this repo is not pushed

[19:31:49 - 19:31:52]
anywhere so I did create a git directory

[19:31:51 - 19:31:55]
but I'll probably end up deleting it

[19:31:52 - 19:31:57]
because um uh it would have to stand

[19:31:55 - 19:31:59]
alone and I don't want

[19:31:57 - 19:32:00]
that this isn't beta I'm surprised

[19:31:59 - 19:32:03]
that's

[19:32:00 - 19:32:05]
beta but we are getting um some endpoint

[19:32:03 - 19:32:05]
history

[19:32:05 - 19:32:12]
here I'm not sure how useful this

[19:32:09 - 19:32:14]
is right now I mean this is fine but

[19:32:12 - 19:32:15]
like where's my logging is what I would

[19:32:14 - 19:32:16]
actually be interested in so like

[19:32:15 - 19:32:18]
obviously we've done some we have some

[19:32:16 - 19:32:19]
console logs and where we can do that oh

[19:32:18 - 19:32:23]
cool there's direct Integrations here

[19:32:19 - 19:32:25]
that's nice um and so you know maybe

[19:32:23 - 19:32:27]
that that's somewhere I'm not really

[19:32:25 - 19:32:29]
certain as to to where we'd find that

[19:32:27 - 19:32:32]
direct logging but um yeah that's nice

[19:32:29 - 19:32:35]
that it just pulls up here um but yeah I

[19:32:32 - 19:32:37]
mean that that works so I think that we

[19:32:35 - 19:32:39]
would call this done um there are a few

[19:32:37 - 19:32:40]
other offerings here under the AI so we

[19:32:39 - 19:32:42]
have vectorize which is probably a

[19:32:40 - 19:32:46]
vector database

[19:32:42 - 19:32:47]
um and then we also have uh AI Gateway

[19:32:46 - 19:32:48]
but I'm going to just tear this down as

[19:32:47 - 19:32:50]
I'm going to consider this done I

[19:32:48 - 19:32:51]
actually did create a dog directory but

[19:32:50 - 19:32:54]
I'll probably end up deleting it because

[19:32:51 - 19:32:56]
I want to drop that into um that project

[19:32:54 - 19:32:58]
there we have daily usage Limit Oh so we

[19:32:56 - 19:33:00]
were actually running on the free limit

[19:32:58 - 19:33:01]
so far that's pretty sweet um so I did

[19:33:00 - 19:33:04]
not know that I thought that maybe we

[19:33:01 - 19:33:06]
were on the paid uh because my my credit

[19:33:04 - 19:33:09]
card was hooked up but apparently we are

[19:33:06 - 19:33:12]
on a free tier usage um from this page

[19:33:09 - 19:33:14]
it's not very clear um what we're doing

[19:33:12 - 19:33:15]
so we'll go over to here I mean that's

[19:33:14 - 19:33:17]
if you wanted to select models and

[19:33:15 - 19:33:19]
deploy them very quickly so basically

[19:33:17 - 19:33:20]
that's just templates to deploy so

[19:33:19 - 19:33:22]
that's very straightforward what I'm

[19:33:20 - 19:33:23]
going to do is I'm going to go here into

[19:33:22 - 19:33:25]
this project and I want to tear it down

[19:33:23 - 19:33:26]
since I'm done with it I don't believe

[19:33:25 - 19:33:30]
it costs us anything but it is kind of

[19:33:26 - 19:33:32]
open up to the Internet and um I'm not

[19:33:30 - 19:33:34]
exactly sure on how to protect it maybe

[19:33:32 - 19:33:36]
that's where you put it in front of um

[19:33:34 - 19:33:38]
that other Gateway if we have to spin up

[19:33:36 - 19:33:40]
another one we'll do that here uh

[19:33:38 - 19:33:42]
shortly we'll go ahead and delete it and

[19:33:40 - 19:33:44]
so now this workers deleted we don't

[19:33:42 - 19:33:47]
have to worry about spend um I want to

[19:33:44 - 19:33:51]
get this project into our GitHub repo so

[19:33:47 - 19:33:53]
we have GitHub um exam

[19:33:51 - 19:33:58]
Pro

[19:33:53 - 19:34:01]
Co exam proo geni ex

[19:33:58 - 19:34:03]
Essentials okay and uh I'm just going to

[19:34:01 - 19:34:05]
open this

[19:34:03 - 19:34:07]
up and in vs code I'm going to go back

[19:34:05 - 19:34:09]
over to the project that I had open

[19:34:07 - 19:34:13]
which is over here and what I want to do

[19:34:09 - 19:34:16]
is I just want to uh remove RF the.git

[19:34:13 - 19:34:18]
directory as we are not um uh we're not

[19:34:16 - 19:34:21]
going to use it that way but I need to

[19:34:18 - 19:34:23]
just open this up in a folder

[19:34:21 - 19:34:26]
[Music]

[19:34:23 - 19:34:28]
here I'll just have to open this find

[19:34:26 - 19:34:30]
and file explorer

[19:34:28 - 19:34:33]
here and I'm just going to bring that

[19:34:30 - 19:34:34]
code over so we go back over to I really

[19:34:33 - 19:34:36]
got to close some of these other tabs I

[19:34:34 - 19:34:37]
have way too many tabs open it's really

[19:34:36 - 19:34:40]
confusing me here

[19:34:37 - 19:34:43]
today

[19:34:40 - 19:34:44]
um and uh maybe this one here there we

[19:34:43 - 19:34:46]
go and

[19:34:44 - 19:34:47]
so yeah yeah this is the one I want and

[19:34:46 - 19:34:50]
so I'm going to go here and make a new

[19:34:47 - 19:34:50]
folder we'll call it

[19:34:50 - 19:34:59]
cloudflare and I want to bring

[19:34:53 - 19:35:00]
in um all this code so this one is just

[19:34:59 - 19:35:02]
AI workers I'll make a new folder here

[19:35:00 - 19:35:05]
called AI

[19:35:02 - 19:35:08]
workers I don't know if this contains

[19:35:05 - 19:35:08]
any kind of sensitive

[19:35:08 - 19:35:14]
information so if we go to Wrangler here

[19:35:10 - 19:35:17]
as long as it's not my uh permissions or

[19:35:14 - 19:35:17]
something like that I don't think it

[19:35:17 - 19:35:22]
is like I think that that since they

[19:35:20 - 19:35:23]
have a DOT get ignore that it's pretty

[19:35:22 - 19:35:25]
safe because I would assume that they

[19:35:23 - 19:35:26]
would not let anything bad in here we'll

[19:35:25 - 19:35:27]
go ahead and commit it there's obviously

[19:35:26 - 19:35:29]
a lot of stuff there's one thing that we

[19:35:27 - 19:35:32]
should ignore it's actually not

[19:35:29 - 19:35:33]
ignoring node modules that's something

[19:35:32 - 19:35:37]
it should actually

[19:35:33 - 19:35:37]
ignore node

[19:35:37 - 19:35:43]
modules we do not want that we go to

[19:35:41 - 19:35:43]
refresh

[19:35:46 - 19:35:52]
here no no no I don't want node modules

[19:35:49 - 19:35:52]
refresh

[19:35:58 - 19:36:02]
[Music]

[19:36:02 - 19:36:08]
refresh I really don't want it to

[19:36:05 - 19:36:12]
take all of that it really should uh get

[19:36:08 - 19:36:12]
rid of all that

[19:36:15 - 19:36:19]
did I spell node modules wrong I don't

[19:36:17 - 19:36:19]
think I

[19:36:21 - 19:36:26]
did it's kind of annoying uh maybe it's

[19:36:24 - 19:36:28]
not committed the change for uh the good

[19:36:26 - 19:36:31]
ignore so maybe if I just add the get

[19:36:28 - 19:36:31]
ignore like

[19:36:35 - 19:36:42]
this it just it's

[19:36:38 - 19:36:45]
refusing it's refusing to ignore the

[19:36:42 - 19:36:48]
node modules directory node modules so

[19:36:45 - 19:36:48]
I'm going to just commit that

[19:36:48 - 19:36:54]
one just that one sometimes this stuff

[19:36:51 - 19:36:54]
is finicky

[19:37:01 - 19:37:05]
right well I mean I did I said uh I said

[19:37:04 - 19:37:07]
what it

[19:37:05 - 19:37:09]
was and now we have all these other

[19:37:07 - 19:37:11]
changes I just wanted to ignore the node

[19:37:09 - 19:37:13]
modules I don't know why it won't do

[19:37:11 - 19:37:15]
that

[19:37:13 - 19:37:17]
uh you know node modules like come on

[19:37:15 - 19:37:21]
folks can do I have to go top level for

[19:37:17 - 19:37:21]
this I'll make a

[19:37:24 - 19:37:28]
um new folder dot get ignore here got

[19:37:27 - 19:37:30]
get

[19:37:28 - 19:37:31]
ignore I shouldn't really have to do

[19:37:30 - 19:37:33]
this but we'll go ahead and we'll copy

[19:37:31 - 19:37:37]
the contents of this

[19:37:33 - 19:37:37]
here oops

[19:37:42 - 19:37:45]
I didn't make mean to make that a

[19:37:45 - 19:37:52]
folder okay we'll try this one more

[19:37:48 - 19:37:52]
time do get

[19:37:54 - 19:37:58]
ignore okay you know what I'm going to

[19:37:56 - 19:37:59]
do because this is being really stupid I

[19:37:58 - 19:38:02]
don't like what this is doing so I'm

[19:37:59 - 19:38:04]
going to go ahead and just discard all

[19:38:02 - 19:38:08]
changes

[19:38:04 - 19:38:12]
delete discard just get out of here just

[19:38:08 - 19:38:14]
get out of here go go get out of here

[19:38:12 - 19:38:15]
I'm so mad let me go back I'm we going

[19:38:14 - 19:38:17]
to reload this I hope all that stuff's

[19:38:15 - 19:38:21]
gone I really don't want to have to deal

[19:38:17 - 19:38:24]
with it please don't still be

[19:38:21 - 19:38:27]
there oh I hate you I hate you I hate

[19:38:37 - 19:38:41]
delete I don't want to do this 100 times

[19:38:39 - 19:38:42]
get out of here okay so what I'm going

[19:38:41 - 19:38:45]
to do

[19:38:42 - 19:38:48]
even me I get frustrated all the

[19:38:45 - 19:38:50]
time with this stuff and I know what I'm

[19:38:48 - 19:38:51]
doing right and still we still have

[19:38:50 - 19:38:53]
these problems so I'm going to go ahead

[19:38:51 - 19:38:55]
here and I'm just going to I did not

[19:38:53 - 19:38:58]
want to open this get GitHub get GT here

[19:38:55 - 19:39:00]
today I'm going to just clone this

[19:38:58 - 19:39:02]
repo and then we will bring it over that

[19:39:00 - 19:39:05]
way so I'm going to just make a new uh a

[19:39:02 - 19:39:08]
new terminal

[19:39:05 - 19:39:08]
here new

[19:39:09 - 19:39:13]
terminal and we'll say get clone and

[19:39:12 - 19:39:17]
we'll bring that down there I should

[19:39:13 - 19:39:21]
have permission to do so oh my

[19:39:17 - 19:39:24]
goodness I hate this I hate this so much

[19:39:21 - 19:39:26]
okay um give me a second okay all right

[19:39:24 - 19:39:26]
I'm back in

[19:39:43 - 19:39:47]
here and that might fix a lot of my

[19:39:48 - 19:39:52]
problems okay and I'm just hoping that

[19:39:50 - 19:39:54]
there's no sensitive information in here

[19:39:52 - 19:39:57]
as the dock ignore is not acting

[19:39:54 - 19:39:59]
properly um but I'll go into here and

[19:39:57 - 19:40:01]
I'm going to just drag uh this stuff

[19:39:59 - 19:40:04]
into

[19:40:01 - 19:40:07]
here and we'll say

[19:40:04 - 19:40:09]
replace and I want to expand this here

[19:40:07 - 19:40:13]
and I'm just checking is there anything

[19:40:09 - 19:40:16]
in here no not really no uh we have

[19:40:13 - 19:40:18]
that I'm looking if there's any like

[19:40:16 - 19:40:20]
specific configurations like there is

[19:40:18 - 19:40:22]
the name of the project up here which I

[19:40:20 - 19:40:25]
I don't think is an issue but I'm just

[19:40:22 - 19:40:25]
going to go here and just say replace

[19:40:26 - 19:40:30]
me all right and now we can go ahead and

[19:40:29 - 19:40:36]
Commit

[19:40:30 - 19:40:36]
This so AI worker example for cloud

[19:40:39 - 19:40:44]
flare there we go we'll call that done

[19:40:41 - 19:40:47]
and I'll see you in the next one okay

[19:40:44 - 19:40:50]
[Music]

[19:40:47 - 19:40:52]
ciao let's take a look at tpus which

[19:40:50 - 19:40:54]
stands for tensor processing unit this

[19:40:52 - 19:40:56]
is an AI accelerator that is an

[19:40:54 - 19:40:58]
application specific integrated circuit

[19:40:56 - 19:41:00]
an Asic developed by Google for neural

[19:40:58 - 19:41:03]
network machine learning using Google's

[19:41:00 - 19:41:05]
own tensorflow software it's hard not to

[19:41:03 - 19:41:07]
talk about tpus when we're also talking

[19:41:05 - 19:41:09]
about tensor flow which we cover

[19:41:07 - 19:41:11]
somewhere else in this course uh tpos

[19:41:09 - 19:41:13]
are designed for high volume of low

[19:41:11 - 19:41:16]
prision computation and they've been

[19:41:13 - 19:41:19]
making this uh since 2016 so at least

[19:41:16 - 19:41:21]
from this time at least almost almost 10

[19:41:19 - 19:41:22]
years but we're getting close to there

[19:41:21 - 19:41:26]
um and so here's an example of a TPU

[19:41:22 - 19:41:29]
version 3 and a TPU uh uh v5p so if you

[19:41:26 - 19:41:30]
really like the tensorflow framework uh

[19:41:29 - 19:41:31]
Google cloud is going to be a great

[19:41:30 - 19:41:34]
place for you to hang out because they

[19:41:31 - 19:41:39]
have tpus you can spin up there um but

[19:41:34 - 19:41:39]
yeah there you go

[19:41:39 - 19:41:43]
[Music]

[19:41:41 - 19:41:45]
let's talk about igpus which stands for

[19:41:43 - 19:41:47]
integrated Graphics processing units

[19:41:45 - 19:41:50]
this is when a CPU contains capabilities

[19:41:47 - 19:41:53]
of Performing the task similar to a

[19:41:50 - 19:41:55]
dedicated GPU so an example might be

[19:41:53 - 19:41:56]
something like the Intel lunar Lake chip

[19:41:55 - 19:42:00]
which contains multiple systems

[19:41:56 - 19:42:02]
including igpu so here is a picture of

[19:42:00 - 19:42:04]
the actual chip itself sometimes I like

[19:42:02 - 19:42:06]
to say CPU for a chip but a chip can

[19:42:04 - 19:42:08]
contain many systems obviously it is a

[19:42:06 - 19:42:11]
Computing processing unit with other

[19:42:08 - 19:42:13]
processing units within it so um if we

[19:42:11 - 19:42:15]
look a bit closer we can see the Die

[19:42:13 - 19:42:17]
Cast the actual Pathways that are on the

[19:42:15 - 19:42:19]
chip um and all these things actually

[19:42:17 - 19:42:21]
map to very specific things kind of like

[19:42:19 - 19:42:23]
your brain where one section is

[19:42:21 - 19:42:27]
specifically for GPU you'll also also

[19:42:23 - 19:42:29]
see ipus and mpus which are all specific

[19:42:27 - 19:42:31]
to AI stuff so you can see that more

[19:42:29 - 19:42:33]
modern chips when we talk about aips

[19:42:31 - 19:42:36]
these are the chips that we're talking

[19:42:33 - 19:42:40]
about have all this stuff built in um to

[19:42:36 - 19:42:43]
allow you uh to run ai ai models on your

[19:42:40 - 19:42:46]
laptop Tops on your mobile devices there

[19:42:43 - 19:42:47]
is another term called dgpu uh which

[19:42:46 - 19:42:49]
stands for dedicated graphics Processing

[19:42:47 - 19:42:52]
Unit that's just your normal GPU your

[19:42:49 - 19:42:54]
normal gra uh graphics card um but

[19:42:52 - 19:42:57]
sometimes you see that when you need to

[19:42:54 - 19:42:59]
distinguish it between igpus and d gpus

[19:42:57 - 19:43:01]
uh how well do igpus perform they

[19:42:59 - 19:43:03]
actually perform extremely well

[19:43:01 - 19:43:06]
surprisingly um obviously a dedicated

[19:43:03 - 19:43:08]
GPU is going to be better um but uh you

[19:43:06 - 19:43:11]
can definitely get uh like a modern

[19:43:08 - 19:43:13]
machine and it performs like just like

[19:43:11 - 19:43:16]
the last or second second last

[19:43:13 - 19:43:18]
generation of um of graphics cards and

[19:43:16 - 19:43:21]
so it becomes extremely affordable and

[19:43:18 - 19:43:23]
and very good so yeah uh if you can get

[19:43:21 - 19:43:25]
a machine that has an igpu in it you

[19:43:23 - 19:43:27]
absolutely want to but anything you buy

[19:43:25 - 19:43:28]
these days generally should have them um

[19:43:27 - 19:43:33]
but this is not limited to Intel

[19:43:28 - 19:43:35]
obviously AMD uh Apple's metal um chips

[19:43:33 - 19:43:39]
have them as well so there you

[19:43:35 - 19:43:42]
[Music]

[19:43:39 - 19:43:44]
go we also have vpus so vpu stands for

[19:43:42 - 19:43:46]
visual processing unit this is an a

[19:43:44 - 19:43:48]
accelerator specialized in Machine

[19:43:46 - 19:43:51]
Vision tasks so think if you need to do

[19:43:48 - 19:43:54]
convolutional neural networks um Intel

[19:43:51 - 19:43:56]
has something called the the midus um

[19:43:54 - 19:43:59]
and I Intel I think bought this company

[19:43:56 - 19:44:02]
in 2016 so this was the known thing for

[19:43:59 - 19:44:04]
having a vpu and so now Intel owns it

[19:44:02 - 19:44:05]
but the idea is that it looks like a USB

[19:44:04 - 19:44:08]
stick and you just plug it into your

[19:44:05 - 19:44:12]
computer and now you have vpus that you

[19:44:08 - 19:44:14]
can utilize anywhere so yeah it's pretty

[19:44:12 - 19:44:17]
straightforward there you

[19:44:14 - 19:44:19]
[Music]

[19:44:17 - 19:44:22]
go all right I want to talk about two

[19:44:19 - 19:44:24]
things um that Intel has with ads and

[19:44:22 - 19:44:26]
the first is Intel Zeon scalable

[19:44:24 - 19:44:29]
processor and the second is Intel Gotti

[19:44:26 - 19:44:32]
um so itus of course does work with or

[19:44:29 - 19:44:34]
purchases um Hardware from other um uh

[19:44:32 - 19:44:37]
other companies like they use AMD and

[19:44:34 - 19:44:39]
Nidia but I think it's worth mentioning

[19:44:37 - 19:44:41]
Intel in a little bit more detail here

[19:44:39 - 19:44:45]
because every time I go to reinvent

[19:44:41 - 19:44:47]
Intel has a big giant booth and you can

[19:44:45 - 19:44:49]
go scour the ads website and it just

[19:44:47 - 19:44:52]
looks like ADS works more closely with

[19:44:49 - 19:44:54]
Intel as opposed to the other uh

[19:44:52 - 19:44:56]
providers not to say that Intel is not

[19:44:54 - 19:44:59]
being utilized on gcp and Azure and

[19:44:56 - 19:45:01]
others but uh I just noticed something

[19:44:59 - 19:45:03]
more going on there with ads but let's

[19:45:01 - 19:45:04]
first talk about Intel xon scalable

[19:45:03 - 19:45:06]
processors these are high performance

[19:45:04 - 19:45:08]
CPUs designed for Enterprise and server

[19:45:06 - 19:45:10]
applications commonly used in a

[19:45:08 - 19:45:13]
instances um that scalable part makes

[19:45:10 - 19:45:15]
them very good for machine learning so

[19:45:13 - 19:45:17]
you often are going to be be using Intel

[19:45:15 - 19:45:18]
xon processors whether you know or not

[19:45:17 - 19:45:22]
on

[19:45:18 - 19:45:25]
ads the Intel is the Intel uh Habana

[19:45:22 - 19:45:28]
Gotti uh processor so this is a

[19:45:25 - 19:45:30]
processor specialized for AI training uh

[19:45:28 - 19:45:32]
you could say that this is a direct

[19:45:30 - 19:45:36]
competitor to Nvidia or a similar

[19:45:32 - 19:45:39]
competitor because uh they uh they uh do

[19:45:36 - 19:45:41]
something very similar um I believe that

[19:45:39 - 19:45:44]
Intel Gotti has their own SDK called

[19:45:41 - 19:45:47]
synapse AI uh that you can use to

[19:45:44 - 19:45:50]
interact with it so you launch up Sage

[19:45:47 - 19:45:53]
maker and then use uh that uh that API

[19:45:50 - 19:45:56]
or SDK in order to uh best utilize uh

[19:45:53 - 19:45:59]
that Hardware there but both of these um

[19:45:56 - 19:46:01]
pieces of Hardware are offered uh on ads

[19:45:59 - 19:46:04]
and I think it's just good to know them

[19:46:01 - 19:46:07]
at least to name uh what they are

[19:46:04 - 19:46:10]
[Music]

[19:46:07 - 19:46:11]
okay hey this is Andrew Brown and let's

[19:46:10 - 19:46:13]
talk about GPU

[19:46:11 - 19:46:14]
I'm sure most people know what gpus are

[19:46:13 - 19:46:15]
here but I'm going to talk about it

[19:46:14 - 19:46:18]
anyway because I want to talk about

[19:46:15 - 19:46:20]
cudas so a GPU stands for General

[19:46:18 - 19:46:22]
processing unit and it's a processor

[19:46:20 - 19:46:24]
that is specialized to quickly render

[19:46:22 - 19:46:27]
high resolution images and videos

[19:46:24 - 19:46:29]
concurrently if you've ever played video

[19:46:27 - 19:46:31]
games you know you need a good GPU

[19:46:29 - 19:46:33]
because it's all about those images

[19:46:31 - 19:46:36]
however gpus can perform parallel

[19:46:33 - 19:46:38]
operations on multiple sets of data so

[19:46:36 - 19:46:40]
they can also be used for non-graphical

[19:46:38 - 19:46:42]
tasks and this makes it really good for

[19:46:40 - 19:46:45]
machine learning and scientific

[19:46:42 - 19:46:46]
computation so if you're trying to uh

[19:46:45 - 19:46:48]
convince your significant other that you

[19:46:46 - 19:46:49]
need a better graphics card you can just

[19:46:48 - 19:46:51]
tell them it's for work I need it for

[19:46:49 - 19:46:53]
machine learning and scientific comp

[19:46:51 - 19:46:56]
computation it's not your fault that you

[19:46:53 - 19:46:57]
can also play video games with it and so

[19:46:56 - 19:46:59]
we have like a graphic there on the

[19:46:57 - 19:47:01]
right hand side I think I got that from

[19:46:59 - 19:47:03]
Nvidia and so they're kind of trying to

[19:47:01 - 19:47:05]
demonstrate the difference between uh

[19:47:03 - 19:47:08]
the paralyzation with GPU versus serial

[19:47:05 - 19:47:10]
tasks with CPU but let's go and just

[19:47:08 - 19:47:13]
read a little bit more so CPUs can have

[19:47:10 - 19:47:16]
an average of to 16 processor cores gpus

[19:47:13 - 19:47:19]
can have thousands of processor cores

[19:47:16 - 19:47:21]
how that works I have no idea but I just

[19:47:19 - 19:47:23]
know that that's how it works uh so we

[19:47:21 - 19:47:28]
have 48 gpus can provide as many as

[19:47:23 - 19:47:29]
40,000 cores so that is a lot gpus are

[19:47:28 - 19:47:31]
best suited for repetitive and highly

[19:47:29 - 19:47:33]
parallel Computing tasks such as

[19:47:31 - 19:47:35]
rendering Graphics cryptocurrency mining

[19:47:33 - 19:47:38]
if people are even still doing that and

[19:47:35 - 19:47:42]
deep learning and machine learning so

[19:47:38 - 19:47:46]
you know there you go that's gpus

[19:47:42 - 19:47:48]
[Music]

[19:47:46 - 19:47:50]
all right let's take a look here at Cuda

[19:47:48 - 19:47:52]
but before we do let's talk about Nvidia

[19:47:50 - 19:47:54]
so Nvidia is a company that manufactures

[19:47:52 - 19:47:56]
graphical processing units for gaming

[19:47:54 - 19:47:58]
and professional markets if you have

[19:47:56 - 19:48:01]
ever played video games and you build

[19:47:58 - 19:48:03]
your own rig um a lot of people like to

[19:48:01 - 19:48:06]
choose Nvidia but Nvidia can do things

[19:48:03 - 19:48:09]
other than video games and this is due

[19:48:06 - 19:48:11]
to their framework uh called cuda which

[19:48:09 - 19:48:12]
stands for compute UniFi device

[19:48:11 - 19:48:15]
architecture so it's a parallel

[19:48:12 - 19:48:17]
Computing platform and API I said

[19:48:15 - 19:48:19]
framework but I guess it's an API by

[19:48:17 - 19:48:21]
inidia that allows developers to use

[19:48:19 - 19:48:24]
Cuda enable gpus for general purpose

[19:48:21 - 19:48:26]
Computing gpus and it says

[19:48:24 - 19:48:28]
gpgpu because it's saying general

[19:48:26 - 19:48:32]
purpose gpus I know that's a mouthful

[19:48:28 - 19:48:36]
there um so over on AWS they have a

[19:48:32 - 19:48:39]
bunch of instances that um can utilize

[19:48:36 - 19:48:42]
uh Nvidia GPU so I adus is always

[19:48:39 - 19:48:44]
changing the instance so these could be

[19:48:42 - 19:48:49]
old but you can see we have a P3 which

[19:48:44 - 19:48:52]
has the Tesla Tesla V100 you have the G3

[19:48:49 - 19:48:55]
with a Tesla M M60 the G4 with a T4 uh

[19:48:52 - 19:48:57]
the P4 with the Tesla

[19:48:55 - 19:48:58]
a00 so there's probably these are

[19:48:57 - 19:49:01]
probably old ones there's new instances

[19:48:58 - 19:49:04]
with newer Nvidia cards but my point is

[19:49:01 - 19:49:06]
is that aabus has uh gpus that you can

[19:49:04 - 19:49:08]
utilize another thing I want to point

[19:49:06 - 19:49:10]
out with Cuda is that all major deep

[19:49:08 - 19:49:13]
learning Frameworks are integrated with

[19:49:10 - 19:49:17]
Nvidia learning sdks there's a big fight

[19:49:13 - 19:49:20]
or War over um uh these companies that

[19:49:17 - 19:49:22]
make uh gpus and CPUs because they

[19:49:20 - 19:49:24]
really want the uh Theirs to be used for

[19:49:22 - 19:49:26]
machine learning so you can definitely

[19:49:24 - 19:49:28]
be sure that AMD probably has some kind

[19:49:26 - 19:49:31]
of similar offering or something uh and

[19:49:28 - 19:49:33]
definitely Intel as well um but Nvidia

[19:49:31 - 19:49:36]
has done a very good job in uh making

[19:49:33 - 19:49:37]
sure that theirs is the most popular um

[19:49:36 - 19:49:40]
so Nvidia deep learning SDK is a

[19:49:37 - 19:49:41]
collection of En uh Nvidia libraries for

[19:49:40 - 19:49:43]
for deep learning so this is something

[19:49:41 - 19:49:46]
that this is the SDK you can use with

[19:49:43 - 19:49:47]
Cuda to interact with their API uh so

[19:49:46 - 19:49:50]
one of those libraries are called cuda

[19:49:47 - 19:49:52]
deep neural network library so that's

[19:49:50 - 19:49:55]
something you can use with it and it's

[19:49:52 - 19:49:57]
uh tuned for a bunch of stuff if it

[19:49:55 - 19:49:59]
looks like it's getting a little bit too

[19:49:57 - 19:50:02]
um uh technical it's because this slide

[19:49:59 - 19:50:05]
was was for my machine learning uh

[19:50:02 - 19:50:07]
inabus specialty and I didn't do a whole

[19:50:05 - 19:50:09]
lot to change it and BR it over uh so

[19:50:07 - 19:50:10]
you don't don't really need to know that

[19:50:09 - 19:50:13]
last part there but just understand what

[19:50:10 - 19:50:15]
Cuda is and that it's uh very important

[19:50:13 - 19:50:19]
uh for working with machine learning and

[19:50:15 - 19:50:20]
adus has uh good offerings for instances

[19:50:19 - 19:50:23]
with it

[19:50:20 - 19:50:26]
[Music]

[19:50:23 - 19:50:28]
okay hey this is Andrew Brown from exam

[19:50:26 - 19:50:30]
Pro and we are looking at tensor flow so

[19:50:28 - 19:50:32]
tensorflow is a low-level deep learning

[19:50:30 - 19:50:34]
machine learning framework created by

[19:50:32 - 19:50:38]
the Google brain team and tensorflow is

[19:50:34 - 19:50:40]
written in Python C++ Cuda and there are

[19:50:38 - 19:50:42]
apis to allow you to use various other

[19:50:40 - 19:50:45]
langu es and so tensor flow is all based

[19:50:42 - 19:50:48]
around this idea of a tensor so a tensor

[19:50:45 - 19:50:51]
is a multi-dimensional array and so they

[19:50:48 - 19:50:53]
call ts. tensor in their their stuff and

[19:50:51 - 19:50:57]
it's similar to a numpy ND array of

[19:50:53 - 19:51:00]
objects and so tf. tensors can reside in

[19:50:57 - 19:51:01]
accelerator memory like a GPU uh so

[19:51:00 - 19:51:03]
they're basically a new type of data

[19:51:01 - 19:51:06]
structure um that's just very

[19:51:03 - 19:51:08]
specialized for uh machine learning and

[19:51:06 - 19:51:09]
Google X has created their own Hardware

[19:51:08 - 19:51:12]
called a tensor Processing Unit

[19:51:09 - 19:51:15]
specifically optimize for tensor flow

[19:51:12 - 19:51:17]
and the tensor data structure uh the way

[19:51:15 - 19:51:19]
you write tensor flow is in Python an

[19:51:17 - 19:51:21]
example of an ml model in tensor flow is

[19:51:19 - 19:51:23]
here on the left- hand side technically

[19:51:21 - 19:51:26]
this is Cirus Cirus is a highlevel

[19:51:23 - 19:51:28]
abstraction of tensor flow and so it can

[19:51:26 - 19:51:30]
get a bit confusing initially the

[19:51:28 - 19:51:31]
difference between curus and tensor flow

[19:51:30 - 19:51:33]
but they're essentially the same thing

[19:51:31 - 19:51:36]
because Cirus is packaged with tensor

[19:51:33 - 19:51:38]
flow uh uh for the Google Cloud platform

[19:51:36 - 19:51:39]
they specifically offer tensorflow

[19:51:38 - 19:51:42]
enterprise so they accelerate and scale

[19:51:39 - 19:51:44]
ml work loads on the cloud with comp

[19:51:42 - 19:51:46]
compatibility tested and optimized

[19:51:44 - 19:51:48]
tensor flow along with Enterprise ready

[19:51:46 - 19:51:52]
services and support

[19:51:48 - 19:51:54]
[Music]

[19:51:52 - 19:51:55]
okay here's an interesting technique

[19:51:54 - 19:51:57]
that I saw that I thought was worth

[19:51:55 - 19:51:59]
mentioning which is Medusa where it adds

[19:51:57 - 19:52:02]
heads to an llm to predict multiple

[19:51:59 - 19:52:05]
future tokens simultaneously the idea is

[19:52:02 - 19:52:06]
that it will increase um uh performance

[19:52:05 - 19:52:09]
of prediction so you get information a

[19:52:06 - 19:52:10]
lot faster um there are very specific

[19:52:09 - 19:52:12]
models that work with Medusa one's

[19:52:10 - 19:52:14]
called Zephyr and the other one's called

[19:52:12 - 19:52:18]
uh vicuna and this technique can even

[19:52:14 - 19:52:20]
work on something that is GPU poor but

[19:52:18 - 19:52:21]
again this is for very specific models

[19:52:20 - 19:52:23]
um but I just thought it was very

[19:52:21 - 19:52:26]
interesting that by adding multiple

[19:52:23 - 19:52:29]
heads to an llm uh the idea is that it

[19:52:26 - 19:52:31]
can then uh predict things a lot faster

[19:52:29 - 19:52:33]
because you have multiple things trying

[19:52:31 - 19:52:34]
to make predictions simultaneously at

[19:52:33 - 19:52:38]
the same

[19:52:34 - 19:52:40]
[Music]

[19:52:38 - 19:52:42]
time all right let's take a look here at

[19:52:40 - 19:52:43]
flash attention which is a memory

[19:52:42 - 19:52:46]
efficient faster variant of the

[19:52:43 - 19:52:47]
traditional attention mechanism

[19:52:46 - 19:52:49]
optimized for gpus to handle longer

[19:52:47 - 19:52:51]
sequences with reduce computation and

[19:52:49 - 19:52:52]
memory overhead the only thing I want

[19:52:51 - 19:52:54]
you to remember is that it is a better

[19:52:52 - 19:52:56]
version of the traditional attention

[19:52:54 - 19:52:58]
mechanism there's this really cool

[19:52:56 - 19:53:00]
diagram if you want to read more about

[19:52:58 - 19:53:02]
it you can go to the repo here it comes

[19:53:00 - 19:53:05]
in multiple variants so we have one two

[19:53:02 - 19:53:06]
and three and uh three is not

[19:53:05 - 19:53:08]
necessarily better than two it's just

[19:53:06 - 19:53:11]
based on what you're doing so if you're

[19:53:08 - 19:53:14]
utilizing Hopper gpus which is a type of

[19:53:11 - 19:53:16]
GPU produced by Nvidia like the h100

[19:53:14 - 19:53:18]
then you'd want to take advantage of

[19:53:16 - 19:53:20]
flash attention 3 flash attention

[19:53:18 - 19:53:22]
achieves efficiency by Computing

[19:53:20 - 19:53:25]
attention scores in small chunks fusing

[19:53:22 - 19:53:27]
operations like softmax and Matrix

[19:53:25 - 19:53:28]
multiplications to minimize memory use

[19:53:27 - 19:53:30]
and speed up computation so they're

[19:53:28 - 19:53:33]
doing a bunch of uh big brain stuff

[19:53:30 - 19:53:34]
there to make things more efficient but

[19:53:33 - 19:53:36]
just remember that flash attention is

[19:53:34 - 19:53:37]
more efficient and you will see that

[19:53:36 - 19:53:41]
term come up again and again especially

[19:53:37 - 19:53:41]
when you are fine-tuning

[19:53:42 - 19:53:45]
[Music]

[19:53:43 - 19:53:47]
let's take a look at lit GPT this is a

[19:53:45 - 19:53:49]
CA tool to pre-train fine tune and

[19:53:47 - 19:53:52]
deploy llms at scale and so you can find

[19:53:49 - 19:53:55]
it here in its GitHub repo here are all

[19:53:52 - 19:53:58]
the CLI commands that it can utilize um

[19:53:55 - 19:53:59]
as you can see that it can finetune uh

[19:53:58 - 19:54:01]
now that fine-tune command there if you

[19:53:59 - 19:54:03]
do not specify Laura it that's what it's

[19:54:01 - 19:54:05]
going to do by default as that was

[19:54:03 - 19:54:06]
something that uh confused me initially

[19:54:05 - 19:54:08]
but I figured out what was going on

[19:54:06 - 19:54:10]
there it can do scratch implementations

[19:54:08 - 19:54:13]
it has no abstractions it uses Flash

[19:54:10 - 19:54:16]
attention it utilizes lightning fabric

[19:54:13 - 19:54:18]
it's fully sharded data parallel uh and

[19:54:16 - 19:54:21]
it allows you to do per so we can do

[19:54:18 - 19:54:25]
Laura Cura adapter and adapter version

[19:54:21 - 19:54:28]
two it has 20 plus llm recipes uh lit

[19:54:25 - 19:54:30]
GPT has in the works a python API so you

[19:54:28 - 19:54:32]
can in the future easily train it within

[19:54:30 - 19:54:34]
a jupyter notebook that was something

[19:54:32 - 19:54:36]
that I wanted to know how to do but I

[19:54:34 - 19:54:39]
had to uh use um the CLI which is

[19:54:36 - 19:54:41]
totally fine as well um here's an

[19:54:39 - 19:54:43]
example of training so uh imagine that

[19:54:41 - 19:54:45]
we want to do fine tune Laura now if we

[19:54:43 - 19:54:47]
took off theore Laura it would still do

[19:54:45 - 19:54:49]
Laura but I like to be explicit there

[19:54:47 - 19:54:52]
but imagine we want to fine-tune llama

[19:54:49 - 19:54:56]
3.12 1 billion parameter we can provide

[19:54:52 - 19:54:57]
it a a data set as Json um we can say

[19:54:56 - 19:54:59]
how many EPO we want to run with it its

[19:54:57 - 19:55:01]
output directory the Precision we want

[19:54:59 - 19:55:04]
to utilize and then when the model's

[19:55:01 - 19:55:06]
done training it will output into that

[19:55:04 - 19:55:08]
specific directory that we told it to

[19:55:06 - 19:55:11]
and we can use lit GPT to serve the

[19:55:08 - 19:55:14]
model um and do inference so um I'm not

[19:55:11 - 19:55:15]
sure if we included lgpt in our serving

[19:55:14 - 19:55:17]
section but obviously you can serve

[19:55:15 - 19:55:19]
models as well uh there's a lot of

[19:55:17 - 19:55:22]
servers out there uh but for this

[19:55:19 - 19:55:26]
specific example um where we fine-tuned

[19:55:22 - 19:55:27]
and deployed llama 3 billion uh we I

[19:55:26 - 19:55:28]
used lightning Ai and actually I think

[19:55:27 - 19:55:33]
we have a video on this where I show how

[19:55:28 - 19:55:36]
to do this but we use the um one Nvidia

[19:55:33 - 19:55:39]
L4 tensor core with 16 vcpus with 64 GB

[19:55:36 - 19:55:42]
of RAM with 24 GB of virtual Ram with a

[19:55:39 - 19:55:44]
data set of 6,471 examples and we were

[19:55:42 - 19:55:47]
able to train this within 12 minutes CU

[19:55:44 - 19:55:49]
I want you to have an idea how long it

[19:55:47 - 19:55:52]
takes to actually find tuna model and

[19:55:49 - 19:55:55]
you can see here that you can do it for

[19:55:52 - 19:55:57]
free within 12 minutes okay so uh fine

[19:55:55 - 19:56:00]
tuning at least with luras is totally

[19:55:57 - 19:56:02]
within the realm of reality if you are

[19:56:00 - 19:56:03]
full fine toing a model that gets a lot

[19:56:02 - 19:56:06]
more expensive and it's going to be a

[19:56:03 - 19:56:08]
lot harder to do um if you were to

[19:56:06 - 19:56:10]
deploy this into ec2 this would be

[19:56:08 - 19:56:12]
equivalent of a G6 uh

[19:56:10 - 19:56:16]
uh

[19:56:12 - 19:56:20]
g64x large okay and this would cost us

[19:56:16 - 19:56:24]
about $2 American um so that would be

[19:56:20 - 19:56:28]
your closest equivalent there

[19:56:24 - 19:56:30]
[Music]

[19:56:28 - 19:56:32]
okay let's take a look here at

[19:56:30 - 19:56:34]
quantization uh which is a compression

[19:56:32 - 19:56:36]
technique that converts the weights and

[19:56:34 - 19:56:39]
activations within an LM to a lower

[19:56:36 - 19:56:40]
Precision data type so um an example

[19:56:39 - 19:56:44]
might be converting from

[19:56:40 - 19:56:47]
fp32 to int8 um here we have an example

[19:56:44 - 19:56:49]
of quantization against a signal now

[19:56:47 - 19:56:50]
this isn't what we would be doing right

[19:56:49 - 19:56:53]
because we would be changing the weights

[19:56:50 - 19:56:54]
and activations with an LM but this is

[19:56:53 - 19:56:57]
just a visualization that I've seen a

[19:56:54 - 19:56:59]
lot and so uh this is how I kind of

[19:56:57 - 19:57:01]
remember what it is and so imagine you

[19:56:59 - 19:57:04]
have this waveline see the blue waveline

[19:57:01 - 19:57:07]
and that is um has a lot of data because

[19:57:04 - 19:57:09]
it's nice and smooth and as we reduce

[19:57:07 - 19:57:10]
the Precision we get this blocky kind of

[19:57:09 - 19:57:11]
thing

[19:57:10 - 19:57:13]
um but the idea is that you still have

[19:57:11 - 19:57:15]
the same shape so it should perform the

[19:57:13 - 19:57:16]
same way now of course we're not working

[19:57:15 - 19:57:18]
with signals here but hopefully that

[19:57:16 - 19:57:20]
visualization kind of helps you remember

[19:57:18 - 19:57:23]
what quantization is why would we want

[19:57:20 - 19:57:25]
to quantize our model smaller models uh

[19:57:23 - 19:57:29]
mean smaller size footprint faster

[19:57:25 - 19:57:31]
inference not always um as I you know I

[19:57:29 - 19:57:32]
learned this this by actually doing

[19:57:31 - 19:57:35]
quantization for real that when I

[19:57:32 - 19:57:36]
quantize a model I noticed the files

[19:57:35 - 19:57:39]
didn't get smaller and the inference

[19:57:36 - 19:57:42]
wasn't faster however sometimes

[19:57:39 - 19:57:46]
quantization will greatly reduce the

[19:57:42 - 19:57:48]
used amount of resources like RAM and so

[19:57:46 - 19:57:50]
you might cut Ram like totally in half

[19:57:48 - 19:57:53]
and so quantization is worth it uh the

[19:57:50 - 19:57:56]
disadv advantage is potential loss in

[19:57:53 - 19:57:59]
quality because you are compressing the

[19:57:56 - 19:58:02]
quality of the uh the data U just think

[19:57:59 - 19:58:03]
of a JPEG right you have a JPEG and if

[19:58:02 - 19:58:06]
you lower the quality you get a smaller

[19:58:03 - 19:58:09]
file the loads quicker but um you know

[19:58:06 - 19:58:11]
it's not as accurate as the original one

[19:58:09 - 19:58:14]
um examples of quantization would be Q

[19:58:11 - 19:58:16]
Laura and also ggf files but often when

[19:58:14 - 19:58:19]
I see quantization it looks like a big

[19:58:16 - 19:58:21]
mathematical formula uh that is

[19:58:19 - 19:58:22]
converted um that I I personally

[19:58:21 - 19:58:24]
couldn't do only someone that is a data

[19:58:22 - 19:58:28]
scientist can do it and quantization

[19:58:24 - 19:58:30]
techniques greatly vary okay so um you

[19:58:28 - 19:58:32]
know seeing one does not look like the

[19:58:30 - 19:58:34]
other it is not something for us mere

[19:58:32 - 19:58:38]
mortals it's something for uh maybe that

[19:58:34 - 19:58:39]
Rola can do um and I if I had time I'd

[19:58:38 - 19:58:41]
have a followup video because she knows

[19:58:39 - 19:58:43]
quantization very well well but um yeah

[19:58:41 - 19:58:46]
that's

[19:58:43 - 19:58:48]
[Music]

[19:58:46 - 19:58:50]
quantization let's take a look at

[19:58:48 - 19:58:51]
knowledge distillation and the reason I

[19:58:50 - 19:58:52]
want to talk about this is because

[19:58:51 - 19:58:55]
you'll come across models that are

[19:58:52 - 19:58:56]
called distilled models and that implies

[19:58:55 - 19:58:59]
that they've gone through this knowledge

[19:58:56 - 19:59:00]
distillation process so this is when you

[19:58:59 - 19:59:02]
transfer Knowledge from a large model to

[19:59:00 - 19:59:05]
a smaller model so that the smaller

[19:59:02 - 19:59:07]
model performs the same task faster and

[19:59:05 - 19:59:09]
a lower resource cost knowledge

[19:59:07 - 19:59:10]
isolation goal is generally to produce a

[19:59:09 - 19:59:14]
small language model because you're

[19:59:10 - 19:59:17]
making a faster smaller efficient model

[19:59:14 - 19:59:19]
um it is a complicated process and so

[19:59:17 - 19:59:20]
the the greatest simplication that I can

[19:59:19 - 19:59:22]
give to you for knowledge distillation

[19:59:20 - 19:59:25]
is that you have predictions that are

[19:59:22 - 19:59:28]
made from the larger model and you have

[19:59:25 - 19:59:29]
ground truth data and so between these

[19:59:28 - 19:59:32]
two things which we call soft targets

[19:59:29 - 19:59:35]
and hard targets we use that information

[19:59:32 - 19:59:37]
as we um uh train and we uh uh train the

[19:59:35 - 19:59:40]
smaller model to do something that looks

[19:59:37 - 19:59:44]
similar to the teacher model um one

[19:59:40 - 19:59:48]
example of performance wise is uh the

[19:59:44 - 19:59:50]
neotron so the neotron is a model that

[19:59:48 - 19:59:53]
has been turned into minitron which is

[19:59:50 - 19:59:55]
the knowledge distilled version of it uh

[19:59:53 - 19:59:57]
from whatever the 15 billion parameter

[19:59:55 - 20:00:00]
one to an 8 billion parameter one to

[19:59:57 - 20:00:03]
then a 4 billion parameter one greatly

[20:00:00 - 20:00:04]
shrinking the size of that model but the

[20:00:03 - 20:00:06]
idea is that it's supposed to perform as

[20:00:04 - 20:00:08]
good as the

[20:00:06 - 20:00:10]
neotron um and so minitron is something

[20:00:08 - 20:00:12]
you might want to take a look at but it

[20:00:10 - 20:00:14]
uses knowledge distillation and pruning

[20:00:12 - 20:00:16]
so pruning can also be part of the

[20:00:14 - 20:00:18]
process uh along with knowledge

[20:00:16 - 20:00:21]
distillation um to make those smaller

[20:00:18 - 20:00:21]
models

[20:00:22 - 20:00:28]
[Music]

[20:00:26 - 20:00:30]
okay hey everyone it's Andrew Brown and

[20:00:28 - 20:00:32]
R is back and we're talking about the

[20:00:30 - 20:00:35]
most popular topic of all

[20:00:32 - 20:00:36]
quantization uh so we are going to uh

[20:00:35 - 20:00:39]
jump right into it and so Rola has

[20:00:36 - 20:00:42]
prepared some slides as a talking point

[20:00:39 - 20:00:43]
uh for here R would you like to kick us

[20:00:42 - 20:00:47]
off yeah so we're talking about

[20:00:43 - 20:00:50]
quantization which is the process of

[20:00:47 - 20:00:53]
reducing the Precision of the model

[20:00:50 - 20:00:57]
weights um and that helps us

[20:00:53 - 20:01:01]
reduce uh the storage needed for the REM

[20:00:57 - 20:01:03]
and needed for training and uh storage

[20:01:01 - 20:01:04]
and the reason that's important is

[20:01:03 - 20:01:06]
because of these size of the model so

[20:01:04 - 20:01:10]
this we're going to go through to give

[20:01:06 - 20:01:15]
you some idea of um how big these things

[20:01:10 - 20:01:15]
are and and why it matters to

[20:01:16 - 20:01:22]
quantize and uh yeah it is a very hard

[20:01:18 - 20:01:26]
word to say but uh so we have some uh or

[20:01:22 - 20:01:27]
well R has some geni size comparisons or

[20:01:26 - 20:01:29]
considerations that are going to help us

[20:01:27 - 20:01:31]
out here do I click on through am I

[20:01:29 - 20:01:33]
ready to go and for those those who are

[20:01:31 - 20:01:34]
watching Rola could not share her screen

[20:01:33 - 20:01:36]
so she sent me the slides and I'm

[20:01:34 - 20:01:38]
controlling the slides uh but it all

[20:01:36 - 20:01:40]
works out because we're coordinated here

[20:01:38 - 20:01:43]
so uh first one here ml models are often

[20:01:40 - 20:01:46]
sized by numbers of parameters and that

[20:01:43 - 20:01:48]
equals the model weights so what are we

[20:01:46 - 20:01:51]
talking about here right so the machine

[20:01:48 - 20:01:55]
learning models are um a mathematical

[20:01:51 - 20:01:58]
model right um most llms are

[20:01:55 - 20:02:00]
a a neural network and what that is if

[20:01:58 - 20:02:02]
you want to think about it abstractly is

[20:02:00 - 20:02:06]
is a mathematical model it's a complex

[20:02:02 - 20:02:09]
mathematical model um and part of that

[20:02:06 - 20:02:10]
mathematical model are what we call

[20:02:09 - 20:02:13]
parameters

[20:02:10 - 20:02:17]
MH and that's how we size that's one of

[20:02:13 - 20:02:20]
the ways that we size models so um when

[20:02:17 - 20:02:22]
you talk about a 7 billion parameter

[20:02:20 - 20:02:24]
that means it has s billion parameters

[20:02:22 - 20:02:25]
and when you talk about a 70 billion

[20:02:24 - 20:02:28]
parameter that's what we're talking

[20:02:25 - 20:02:31]
about is the number of parameters um

[20:02:28 - 20:02:33]
that the model can uh that we can change

[20:02:31 - 20:02:35]
in a model okay and just to word it in

[20:02:33 - 20:02:37]
another way uh that if it says seven

[20:02:35 - 20:02:40]
billion there's seven billion numbers

[20:02:37 - 20:02:42]
that can be that can be changed okay yes

[20:02:40 - 20:02:45]
yes the parameter is a is a number it's

[20:02:42 - 20:02:48]
a tunable number it's that that can

[20:02:45 - 20:02:49]
control the think of it as a knob that

[20:02:48 - 20:02:53]
um

[20:02:49 - 20:02:54]
changes that gets uh focused or tuned

[20:02:53 - 20:02:57]
with the data scene so that's what

[20:02:54 - 20:03:00]
really um en CA the

[20:02:57 - 20:03:01]
learning and yeah those tunable

[20:03:00 - 20:03:03]
parameters we we call them model weights

[20:03:01 - 20:03:04]
because they're weighted they're tunable

[20:03:03 - 20:03:07]
to a

[20:03:04 - 20:03:10]
number yeah they are a number but they

[20:03:07 - 20:03:13]
they they change so if two models if the

[20:03:10 - 20:03:15]
same exact mathematical model or model

[20:03:13 - 20:03:18]
architecture sees two different sets of

[20:03:15 - 20:03:20]
data it'll come up with two different

[20:03:18 - 20:03:22]
sets of

[20:03:20 - 20:03:25]
parameters uh so the next thing we have

[20:03:22 - 20:03:28]
is size ranges from one uh one parameter

[20:03:25 - 20:03:30]
to two trillion is that two trillion

[20:03:28 - 20:03:32]
about two trillion yeah the gpts have

[20:03:30 - 20:03:33]
about 1.8 trillion to be exact I I

[20:03:32 - 20:03:35]
rounded it up to two but we're right

[20:03:33 - 20:03:37]
there yeah how do you run those cuz I'm

[20:03:35 - 20:03:38]
like thinking about running like there's

[20:03:37 - 20:03:39]
local models like 7even billion

[20:03:38 - 20:03:43]
parameters and you have quen which is

[20:03:39 - 20:03:45]
like 32 billion parameters and like how

[20:03:43 - 20:03:47]
would you even run a two trillion that

[20:03:45 - 20:03:49]
must that must that must be distributed

[20:03:47 - 20:03:50]
right there's no way yes there's there's

[20:03:49 - 20:03:52]
distributed compute you could Shard the

[20:03:50 - 20:03:54]
model itself you can distribute the

[20:03:52 - 20:03:56]
compute there's a there's a whole lot of

[20:03:54 - 20:04:00]
ways to do this and this is why things

[20:03:56 - 20:04:02]
like quantization came up is because

[20:04:00 - 20:04:05]
these things are really really large

[20:04:02 - 20:04:07]
okay uh gen models are in the billion

[20:04:05 - 20:04:08]
and trillion parameters well clearly

[20:04:07 - 20:04:10]
they go in the trillion parameters and

[20:04:08 - 20:04:13]
so it sounds like we're never going to

[20:04:10 - 20:04:16]
get our own local GPT 40 one reasoning

[20:04:13 - 20:04:19]
but uh we'll see the more parameters the

[20:04:16 - 20:04:23]
model has the more data it needs to see

[20:04:19 - 20:04:25]
why is that well because like like like

[20:04:23 - 20:04:27]
think of it as a system right it's a

[20:04:25 - 20:04:29]
mathematical model and each of those

[20:04:27 - 20:04:32]
numbers has to be fine-tuned to encode

[20:04:29 - 20:04:34]
knowledge and the more of them you have

[20:04:32 - 20:04:36]
then the more data you need for them to

[20:04:34 - 20:04:40]
be accurately set if you if you want to

[20:04:36 - 20:04:42]
think about it abstractly right um

[20:04:40 - 20:04:44]
wasn't there some kind of white paper I

[20:04:42 - 20:04:45]
remember you mentioning some some very

[20:04:44 - 20:04:48]
important white paper I just can't

[20:04:45 - 20:04:49]
remember the name of it paper yeah sorry

[20:04:48 - 20:04:50]
what what's it called it's called the

[20:04:49 - 20:04:52]
chinella paper I was gonna call I was

[20:04:50 - 20:04:54]
gonna call I was gonna call it the

[20:04:52 - 20:04:56]
Cassandra paper I don't know no it's the

[20:04:54 - 20:04:59]
chinella paper it's a really cool paper

[20:04:56 - 20:05:04]
it I think it was a the work of Google a

[20:04:59 - 20:05:05]
Google team and the paper looked exactly

[20:05:04 - 20:05:09]
at the

[20:05:05 - 20:05:14]
size at at optimizing llms efficiently

[20:05:09 - 20:05:18]
and so it looked at um the models and

[20:05:14 - 20:05:20]
how much data they need to uh see versus

[20:05:18 - 20:05:22]
how much compute it takes and so on it's

[20:05:20 - 20:05:26]
a really cool paper to look at

[20:05:22 - 20:05:29]
efficiencies of of training llms well if

[20:05:26 - 20:05:30]
if I have a few seconds left to record

[20:05:29 - 20:05:32]
one last video it's going to be the

[20:05:30 - 20:05:36]
chinchilla paper and I'll give the worst

[20:05:32 - 20:05:37]
explanation the best best way I can but

[20:05:36 - 20:05:39]
good paper well yeah well I mean worst

[20:05:37 - 20:05:41]
case people can read it read it full

[20:05:39 - 20:05:43]
fully themselves but my summary probably

[20:05:41 - 20:05:44]
would not be very good uh so on the

[20:05:43 - 20:05:47]
right hand side here we have a graph so

[20:05:44 - 20:05:49]
every year the model sizes increases by

[20:05:47 - 20:05:51]
10 uh and I assume More's law means it's

[20:05:49 - 20:05:53]
going to slow down at some point right

[20:05:51 - 20:05:54]
um and so I would assume that it gets

[20:05:53 - 20:05:57]
exhausted one point but just looking

[20:05:54 - 20:06:02]
closely here uh we have Transformers at

[20:05:57 - 20:06:05]
zero or 0.5 billion so that sounds like

[20:06:02 - 20:06:10]
500 million what's

[20:06:05 - 20:06:12]
0.5 billion one yeah 50 billion

[20:06:10 - 20:06:14]
50 million 50 million there we go that's

[20:06:12 - 20:06:16]
what it is 50 million and so that's

[20:06:14 - 20:06:18]
Transformer architecture or oh yeah okay

[20:06:16 - 20:06:20]
so that's when they first introduced it

[20:06:18 - 20:06:23]
which we talked about in the course yeah

[20:06:20 - 20:06:27]
then we have open AI GPT so that's at

[20:06:23 - 20:06:30]
0.11 billion so 100 million 110 million

[20:06:27 - 20:06:33]
parameters then we have Bert which is at

[20:06:30 - 20:06:36]
oh I didn't know it was at 3404 billion

[20:06:33 - 20:06:38]
yes 340 million but you notice that this

[20:06:36 - 20:06:40]
stops at 2021 right so now that we're at

[20:06:38 - 20:06:44]
2024

[20:06:40 - 20:06:47]
2025 models are a lot bigger and the I

[20:06:44 - 20:06:51]
know that the gpts um are are roughly

[20:06:47 - 20:06:53]
about 1.8 so we we pass the 1.6 that's

[20:06:51 - 20:06:55]
here

[20:06:53 - 20:06:58]
um anthropic I don't think they did not

[20:06:55 - 20:07:00]
release the number of parameters openly

[20:06:58 - 20:07:02]
but somewhere around there we are we are

[20:07:00 - 20:07:05]
somewhere around the two trillion

[20:07:02 - 20:07:07]
Mark okay well I I just can't imagine it

[20:07:05 - 20:07:10]
will it will keep going at this rate we

[20:07:07 - 20:07:12]
must we must exhaust it at some point um

[20:07:10 - 20:07:14]
and I think probably one thing that uh

[20:07:12 - 20:07:16]
determines whether they can well maybe

[20:07:14 - 20:07:17]
maybe it's more maybe it's not I don't

[20:07:16 - 20:07:20]
know but all I know is that when you

[20:07:17 - 20:07:21]
have Hardware they have nanometers and

[20:07:20 - 20:07:22]
the smaller they make it the more

[20:07:21 - 20:07:25]
circuits they can fit into it and

[20:07:22 - 20:07:28]
they're getting down to like one one

[20:07:25 - 20:07:29]
nanometer and I'm like what do you do

[20:07:28 - 20:07:32]
once you get down to one nanometer can

[20:07:29 - 20:07:34]
you do 0.5

[20:07:32 - 20:07:36]
nanometers but they're they're using a

[20:07:34 - 20:07:38]
lot of things that are different now

[20:07:36 - 20:07:39]
right so we do understand a lot of

[20:07:38 - 20:07:42]
things we do understand that these

[20:07:39 - 20:07:45]
parameters so the the bigger the model

[20:07:42 - 20:07:47]
the more it can understand right think

[20:07:45 - 20:07:49]
of the model as the brain let's say

[20:07:47 - 20:07:51]
let's say a brain in a human right the

[20:07:49 - 20:07:54]
bigger the brain theoretically that's

[20:07:51 - 20:07:57]
not true in Neuroscience terms but um in

[20:07:54 - 20:08:00]
an abstract way the the bigger the

[20:07:57 - 20:08:04]
processing system uh the mathematical

[20:08:00 - 20:08:07]
model the more it can encode data um but

[20:08:04 - 20:08:08]
we now know that even if you have a big

[20:08:07 - 20:08:12]
mathematical model if it doesn't see

[20:08:08 - 20:08:13]
enough d data the data is not good then

[20:08:12 - 20:08:15]
it doesn't learn as much so there's

[20:08:13 - 20:08:17]
there's the the mathematical model one

[20:08:15 - 20:08:19]
point there's the data on the other

[20:08:17 - 20:08:21]
point how good the data is and then

[20:08:19 - 20:08:23]
there's the underlying hardware and all

[20:08:21 - 20:08:26]
of the infrastructure that these systems

[20:08:23 - 20:08:27]
need right okay so so there's a lot more

[20:08:26 - 20:08:30]
there possibly is a lot more to be done

[20:08:27 - 20:08:32]
to max out the data side and and the

[20:08:30 - 20:08:35]
creative ways of understanding how to

[20:08:32 - 20:08:37]
make these models perform well yeah and

[20:08:35 - 20:08:39]
and quantization is one way right that

[20:08:37 - 20:08:41]
we're talking about from from a storage

[20:08:39 - 20:08:44]
perspective so there's a because these

[20:08:41 - 20:08:46]
models are really really large they've

[20:08:44 - 20:08:48]
really pushed the limit of Hardware um

[20:08:46 - 20:08:50]
and so there's a lot that is being done

[20:08:48 - 20:08:53]
on the level of Hardware so we do have

[20:08:50 - 20:08:54]
purpose built chips for these things um

[20:08:53 - 20:08:56]
and we're thinking about well how do we

[20:08:54 - 20:08:58]
distribute the models how do we

[20:08:56 - 20:09:01]
distribute the processing how do we

[20:08:58 - 20:09:03]
Shard the models um so there's a lot

[20:09:01 - 20:09:05]
happening there uh but there's also a

[20:09:03 - 20:09:08]
lot happening at the level of software

[20:09:05 - 20:09:12]
and the models themselves so how do we

[20:09:08 - 20:09:14]
um how do we for example uh quantize

[20:09:12 - 20:09:17]
which we're going to talk about or how

[20:09:14 - 20:09:19]
do we efficiently tune or how do we so

[20:09:17 - 20:09:21]
all of these things the the the fact

[20:09:19 - 20:09:24]
that the size is absolutely huge has

[20:09:21 - 20:09:25]
really pushed the limit of what we

[20:09:24 - 20:09:30]
traditionally know and that's where all

[20:09:25 - 20:09:31]
of these new um optimizations come in

[20:09:30 - 20:09:33]
well let's let's try to better

[20:09:31 - 20:09:35]
understand sizing and so here we're

[20:09:33 - 20:09:37]
starting to get into sizing ballpark we

[20:09:35 - 20:09:40]
have one parameter at 32bit floats

[20:09:37 - 20:09:43]
equals four bytes um and I think I think

[20:09:40 - 20:09:44]
we said earlier that a parameter is a

[20:09:43 - 20:09:46]
representation of a number and I imagine

[20:09:44 - 20:09:48]
you could represent that number in many

[20:09:46 - 20:09:50]
different ways so here we have one

[20:09:48 - 20:09:52]
parameter 32 bits and then yeah so

[20:09:50 - 20:09:56]
usually models in general so even

[20:09:52 - 20:09:59]
predictive ml uh the most common way to

[20:09:56 - 20:10:01]
encode a number is 32bit float on a

[20:09:59 - 20:10:03]
computer okay yeah and so that takes

[20:10:01 - 20:10:06]
four bytes so every parameter or every

[20:10:03 - 20:10:08]
number you want to save on your computer

[20:10:06 - 20:10:10]
um in this format is going to cost you

[20:10:08 - 20:10:14]
four bytes and is that and so when we

[20:10:10 - 20:10:15]
see 32 FPS uh or 32 FP is that what

[20:10:14 - 20:10:20]
we're talking about is that is that

[20:10:15 - 20:10:22]
standard yeah so that's 32 uh float yeah

[20:10:20 - 20:10:25]
so that's 32 float prision that that's a

[20:10:22 - 20:10:28]
32bit float which is going to cost you

[20:10:25 - 20:10:30]
because every uh bite has eight bits

[20:10:28 - 20:10:32]
that's going to cost you four

[20:10:30 - 20:10:34]
bytes and so yeah if you have 1 billion

[20:10:32 - 20:10:37]
parameters that's four gabt of RAM for

[20:10:34 - 20:10:40]
just parameters oh okay so we can

[20:10:37 - 20:10:42]
extrapolate generally what the memory

[20:10:40 - 20:10:44]
requirements are based on the parameters

[20:10:42 - 20:10:45]
I mean I'm assume there must be more

[20:10:44 - 20:10:47]
than just that right but this will get

[20:10:45 - 20:10:49]
you into a rough ballpark yeah exactly

[20:10:47 - 20:10:51]
so there there's a lot more than that

[20:10:49 - 20:10:52]
but just in base parameters like let's

[20:10:51 - 20:10:55]
say you've got this model you have to

[20:10:52 - 20:10:57]
load it into memory and it has a billion

[20:10:55 - 20:11:01]
parameters well if you encode each

[20:10:57 - 20:11:03]
number as a 32bit which is four bytes

[20:11:01 - 20:11:06]
then you're going to need four gigabytes

[20:11:03 - 20:11:09]
of RAM just to load that thing and and

[20:11:06 - 20:11:11]
and uh one billion parameter just for

[20:11:09 - 20:11:13]
folks that want to try to ground to

[20:11:11 - 20:11:15]
something out there the one that I use a

[20:11:13 - 20:11:18]
lot in this course is the Llama

[20:11:15 - 20:11:19]
3.2 uh 1 billion parameter model because

[20:11:18 - 20:11:21]
that seems to run on everything and that

[20:11:19 - 20:11:23]
makes sense if it's around four to five

[20:11:21 - 20:11:26]
gigabytes most machines will have that

[20:11:23 - 20:11:28]
available uh compute the side is a

[20:11:26 - 20:11:29]
different story but memory memory-wise

[20:11:28 - 20:11:30]
it seems like people would have that

[20:11:29 - 20:11:34]
available but here it says but you need

[20:11:30 - 20:11:36]
20 times more space to uh uh space for

[20:11:34 - 20:11:39]
optimizers gradients activations uh to

[20:11:36 - 20:11:41]
train and so um I I kind learned this

[20:11:39 - 20:11:44]
when I was utilizing open Veno which is

[20:11:41 - 20:11:45]
for optimization that it makes models

[20:11:44 - 20:11:47]
smaller not necessarily through

[20:11:45 - 20:11:49]
quantization but optimizing for the

[20:11:47 - 20:11:50]
Target Hardware but I learned that when

[20:11:49 - 20:11:52]
I trained it they're like oh you need to

[20:11:50 - 20:11:54]
have more I didn't know why I needed to

[20:11:52 - 20:11:58]
have more but I just I I knew I needed

[20:11:54 - 20:12:01]
that uh at at the training phase um what

[20:11:58 - 20:12:03]
because it's more work I guess or no

[20:12:01 - 20:12:06]
because you because you're trying to to

[20:12:03 - 20:12:10]
tune all of these um numbers to the

[20:12:06 - 20:12:12]
right um to to to the right number it

[20:12:10 - 20:12:14]
needs to be for for their learning to

[20:12:12 - 20:12:16]
occur and so there's metadata that comes

[20:12:14 - 20:12:18]
with that so what what the model does is

[20:12:16 - 20:12:20]
in a training process is it starts

[20:12:18 - 20:12:23]
random so let's say you've got one

[20:12:20 - 20:12:25]
billion parameters one t one billion

[20:12:23 - 20:12:27]
knobs to tune you start randomly you

[20:12:25 - 20:12:32]
start you initiate them all at random

[20:12:27 - 20:12:34]
and then you make um you make a guess or

[20:12:32 - 20:12:38]
you make a prediction then you calculate

[20:12:34 - 20:12:40]
how far off you are this is in super

[20:12:38 - 20:12:42]
supervised learning you you calculate

[20:12:40 - 20:12:46]
how far off you are from the

[20:12:42 - 20:12:48]
actual um real answer and then you tune

[20:12:46 - 20:12:51]
the knobs to get closer and then you

[20:12:48 - 20:12:54]
keep iterally iteratively doing that

[20:12:51 - 20:12:55]
until you tune all of the your numbers

[20:12:54 - 20:12:59]
and so there's a lot of metadata that

[20:12:55 - 20:13:02]
comes in um calculating all of these

[20:12:59 - 20:13:04]
things so calculating how far you off

[20:13:02 - 20:13:07]
and calculating your gradient and how

[20:13:04 - 20:13:09]
much you have to shift back or forward

[20:13:07 - 20:13:12]
um and that's estimated about 20 times

[20:13:09 - 20:13:13]
the model size so so is it because

[20:13:12 - 20:13:16]
there's a lot of operations that are

[20:13:13 - 20:13:18]
being performed around just adjusting

[20:13:16 - 20:13:21]
the model weights but also do you have

[20:13:18 - 20:13:25]
to hold in memory uh multiple iterations

[20:13:21 - 20:13:26]
of of of model weights like if you're

[20:13:25 - 20:13:28]
going through multiple uh epochs or

[20:13:26 - 20:13:30]
multiple iterations does it have to hold

[20:13:28 - 20:13:33]
that or does it write it to dis you

[20:13:30 - 20:13:34]
could hold you definitely need to hold

[20:13:33 - 20:13:35]
the current iteration so that you

[20:13:34 - 20:13:38]
calculate the gradient so that you can

[20:13:35 - 20:13:40]
move on you could choose to Cal to to

[20:13:38 - 20:13:42]
keep them all for for historic purposes

[20:13:40 - 20:13:44]
or to for you to understand how the

[20:13:42 - 20:13:46]
training went but um you don't

[20:13:44 - 20:13:51]
necessarily need to

[20:13:46 - 20:13:52]
okay yeah so that makes sense um and so

[20:13:51 - 20:13:54]
one billion parameter model so we have a

[20:13:52 - 20:13:56]
1 billion parameter model and we are

[20:13:54 - 20:13:58]
training it and we're talking about full

[20:13:56 - 20:14:00]
fine tuning so we're adjusting all the

[20:13:58 - 20:14:01]
parameters for those that are listening

[20:14:00 - 20:14:03]
there are different levels there's

[20:14:01 - 20:14:05]
different kinds of uh fine tuning one

[20:14:03 - 20:14:08]
being like uh uh what's it called

[20:14:05 - 20:14:10]
performant performance uh perform

[20:14:08 - 20:14:12]
performance efficient parameter

[20:14:10 - 20:14:13]
efficient model training parameter

[20:14:12 - 20:14:15]
efficient model okay good for a minute

[20:14:13 - 20:14:17]
there I thought like if you're stumbling

[20:14:15 - 20:14:20]
on it's good because uh then everybody

[20:14:17 - 20:14:23]
else uh again it's it's it's good so

[20:14:20 - 20:14:25]
there's so many of these too right yeah

[20:14:23 - 20:14:27]
yeah yeah the uh there's too many

[20:14:25 - 20:14:28]
initialisms uh but we have 1 billion

[20:14:27 - 20:14:31]
parameter model and so that would take

[20:14:28 - 20:14:33]
80 gigabytes of RAM limited of okay so

[20:14:31 - 20:14:38]
that's times 20 and then we have an

[20:14:33 - 20:14:41]
Nvidia A1 GPU I is A1 is A1 better is

[20:14:38 - 20:14:42]
the A1 a100 better or the h100 better I

[20:14:41 - 20:14:45]
can't

[20:14:42 - 20:14:48]
remember I think the h100 is better I

[20:14:45 - 20:14:50]
think that's the newer one so a a100 is

[20:14:48 - 20:14:53]
um yeah I don't think it's the latest

[20:14:50 - 20:14:54]
one definitely not the latest one I mean

[20:14:53 - 20:14:56]
like but I'm just saying like I think

[20:14:54 - 20:15:00]
that it's it's older and so this one is

[20:14:56 - 20:15:02]
a more uh is more cost effective um but

[20:15:00 - 20:15:05]
even still even still that's a lot of

[20:15:02 - 20:15:08]
ramp it's the like a few Generations ago

[20:15:05 - 20:15:11]
that was the the state-ofthe-art and you

[20:15:08 - 20:15:13]
couldn't you know like you said most

[20:15:11 - 20:15:17]
like most people are using let's say the

[20:15:13 - 20:15:19]
7 billion uh llama model that's seven

[20:15:17 - 20:15:23]
times 80 gigs and

[20:15:19 - 20:15:25]
so it's just to show that this would

[20:15:23 - 20:15:28]
have um exceeded what we what

[20:15:25 - 20:15:31]
state-of-the-art was a few a few months

[20:15:28 - 20:15:32]
ago right or a few uh yeah well and and

[20:15:31 - 20:15:35]
since then I think there's been like

[20:15:32 - 20:15:36]
there's been the a100 the h100 there's

[20:15:35 - 20:15:38]
another one and there's another one it's

[20:15:36 - 20:15:40]
unbelievable how fast they're moving

[20:15:38 - 20:15:42]
with this stuff but um but yeah that's

[20:15:40 - 20:15:45]
just one one Billy parameter so binary

[20:15:42 - 20:15:48]
bite encoding example um so if you can

[20:15:45 - 20:15:50]
walk us through uh binary encoding and

[20:15:48 - 20:15:52]
and how is it applicable for

[20:15:50 - 20:15:55]
quantization yeah so quantization is the

[20:15:52 - 20:15:58]
idea of um reducing the Precision and

[20:15:55 - 20:16:00]
the way you do that so right instead of

[20:15:58 - 20:16:04]
using a 32bit which is four bytes for

[20:16:00 - 20:16:08]
each number or each parameter um a lot

[20:16:04 - 20:16:11]
of a lot of providers try to use 16 bits

[20:16:08 - 20:16:13]
which is two bytes and and you can

[20:16:11 - 20:16:15]
encode different ranges in that binary

[20:16:13 - 20:16:17]
range right on on on the computer and

[20:16:15 - 20:16:19]
this is an example so we've got eight

[20:16:17 - 20:16:22]
bits here right which is a single bite

[20:16:19 - 20:16:25]
yep and what if you go if you click you

[20:16:22 - 20:16:27]
can see if binary zero or one right so

[20:16:25 - 20:16:29]
if if all of those are zeros then that

[20:16:27 - 20:16:32]
encodes a zero to decimal so we're

[20:16:29 - 20:16:35]
talking about decimal binary to decimal

[20:16:32 - 20:16:39]
uh change but then if all of those are

[20:16:35 - 20:16:44]
ones then you can encode 255 right so if

[20:16:39 - 20:16:47]
you choose to encode an unsigned integer

[20:16:44 - 20:16:48]
in those eight bits then you can encode

[20:16:47 - 20:16:51]
a zero to

[20:16:48 - 20:16:52]
255 and unsign means counts up there's

[20:16:51 - 20:16:55]
no negative number there's no negative

[20:16:52 - 20:16:57]
exactly okay right now if you decide to

[20:16:55 - 20:17:00]
if you decide you want a sign number

[20:16:57 - 20:17:02]
then you can choose that that first

[20:17:00 - 20:17:05]
bit encodes the

[20:17:02 - 20:17:09]
sign right and so now if um they're all

[20:17:05 - 20:17:10]
zeros it's a zero but that not if it's

[20:17:09 - 20:17:13]
if the first one is a one then it that's

[20:17:10 - 20:17:18]
encodes the plus and then you get plus

[20:17:13 - 20:17:20]
127 so now now you can encode Less in

[20:17:18 - 20:17:22]
integers uh but you could encode a sign

[20:17:20 - 20:17:24]
okay so the first one allows you to

[20:17:22 - 20:17:26]
change the direction of of the number

[20:17:24 - 20:17:28]
right right and so I wanted to let me

[20:17:26 - 20:17:31]
send you I wanted to share my screen but

[20:17:28 - 20:17:33]
I can't so I I want to send you this

[20:17:31 - 20:17:36]
link I don't know if you can share it oh

[20:17:33 - 20:17:39]
I certainly can can you share this can

[20:17:36 - 20:17:43]
you open this this is a this is a nice

[20:17:39 - 20:17:47]
um blog that talks about uh these things

[20:17:43 - 20:17:51]
and can you share it oh yeah I'm just

[20:17:47 - 20:17:51]
pulling up in the chat here sorry

[20:17:51 - 20:17:53]
okay

[20:17:52 - 20:17:57]
[Music]

[20:17:53 - 20:18:00]
okay yep okay so if you go down a little

[20:17:57 - 20:18:01]
bit what you could do is if you got yeah

[20:18:00 - 20:18:02]
just a little bit up with the p where

[20:18:01 - 20:18:04]
the picture is we're just going to go

[20:18:02 - 20:18:07]
over the picture and so if you can zoom

[20:18:04 - 20:18:09]
that out you can decide if you've got 32

[20:18:07 - 20:18:12]
bits for example

[20:18:09 - 20:18:14]
you can decide how many of those how

[20:18:12 - 20:18:18]
many of those pieces in code assign how

[20:18:14 - 20:18:21]
many of those um include an exponent or

[20:18:18 - 20:18:23]
a fraction right so if you can put it if

[20:18:21 - 20:18:25]
you put it in a power form an exponent

[20:18:23 - 20:18:29]
form then your range is a lot

[20:18:25 - 20:18:31]
bigger so now it becomes up to you as a

[20:18:29 - 20:18:33]
person um setting up these systems to

[20:18:31 - 20:18:36]
decide how that goes on Hardware right

[20:18:33 - 20:18:37]
that's the encoding system that's how

[20:18:36 - 20:18:40]
these things are different so if we go

[20:18:37 - 20:18:40]
back to the slides

[20:18:41 - 20:18:48]
sure okay and if we go one more

[20:18:45 - 20:18:50]
slide so what quantization does is like

[20:18:48 - 20:18:55]
we said it's the process of reducing the

[20:18:50 - 20:18:57]
position of a u a digital signal from a

[20:18:55 - 20:18:59]
higher Precision to a lower Precision um

[20:18:57 - 20:19:02]
what we've noticed is that when you've

[20:18:59 - 20:19:07]
got let's say 70 billion

[20:19:02 - 20:19:10]
parameters you don't need to um have the

[20:19:07 - 20:19:13]
Precision a really really really high

[20:19:10 - 20:19:16]
Precision you don't need it to the nth

[20:19:13 - 20:19:18]
power right like look at Pi in the float

[20:19:16 - 20:19:21]
in the table for the floating Point 32

[20:19:18 - 20:19:23]
look at how much how long Pi is you

[20:19:21 - 20:19:25]
might not need that especially when you

[20:19:23 - 20:19:26]
have 80 billion parameters you can get

[20:19:25 - 20:19:31]
away with

[20:19:26 - 20:19:31]
potentially um uh a floating Precision

[20:19:31 - 20:19:34]
of

[20:19:31 - 20:19:38]
16 which is a lot

[20:19:34 - 20:19:40]
shorter but what that does is instead of

[20:19:38 - 20:19:42]
costing you four bytes it's now costing

[20:19:40 - 20:19:47]
you two bytes so You' practically half

[20:19:42 - 20:19:49]
the RAM and the storage on that system M

[20:19:47 - 20:19:51]
right so it reduces the required memory

[20:19:49 - 20:19:55]
um to store and

[20:19:51 - 20:19:57]
train um and that that works well for

[20:19:55 - 20:19:58]
for a lot of models now it depends where

[20:19:57 - 20:20:00]
that you know if you want something

[20:19:58 - 20:20:01]
that's really really high Precision you

[20:20:00 - 20:20:04]
might not be able to do this but for a

[20:20:01 - 20:20:08]
lot of applications this is a really

[20:20:04 - 20:20:09]
good way to save on memory and Storage

[20:20:08 - 20:20:13]
and you can see that there's a

[20:20:09 - 20:20:17]
difference in the range that the numbers

[20:20:13 - 20:20:22]
encode sorry so an FP 16 is different

[20:20:17 - 20:20:25]
from a bf16 because they've changed um

[20:20:22 - 20:20:28]
that that division that encoding of the

[20:20:25 - 20:20:31]
now you've got um 16 bits right two

[20:20:28 - 20:20:34]
bytes is 16 bits they've changed how

[20:20:31 - 20:20:35]
many are the exponent and how many are

[20:20:34 - 20:20:39]
the actual

[20:20:35 - 20:20:43]
fraction and so in an fp16 you can

[20:20:39 - 20:20:48]
um en code integers from minus 6554 to

[20:20:43 - 20:20:50]
plus 65,000 uh 54 but in the BF 16 you

[20:20:48 - 20:20:54]
can encode um decimals that that range a

[20:20:50 - 20:20:57]
lot more uh one thing I learned from you

[20:20:54 - 20:20:59]
uh uh uh about quantization which was a

[20:20:57 - 20:21:01]
big eyeopener for me and I'm sure that

[20:20:59 - 20:21:03]
it does have an increase in performance

[20:21:01 - 20:21:04]
in some cases but when I was learing

[20:21:03 - 20:21:06]
quantization I was running and I wasn't

[20:21:04 - 20:21:08]
seeing any performance gains like like

[20:21:06 - 20:21:10]
in terms of inference like it wasn't

[20:21:08 - 20:21:11]
going faster I'm like oh it's not going

[20:21:10 - 20:21:12]
any faster what's the point of this and

[20:21:11 - 20:21:14]
you're like well yeah but how much

[20:21:12 - 20:21:17]
memory did you save and I was like oh

[20:21:14 - 20:21:18]
and I was saving like a lot of memory um

[20:21:17 - 20:21:21]
overhead and then I was thinking okay so

[20:21:18 - 20:21:23]
quantization could improve performance

[20:21:21 - 20:21:25]
but it can also be the underlying

[20:21:23 - 20:21:27]
resources that you utilize and so now

[20:21:25 - 20:21:29]
you have more memory or compute for

[20:21:27 - 20:21:31]
other things uh or or you can just

[20:21:29 - 20:21:33]
utilize them on machines that have less

[20:21:31 - 20:21:34]
uh less of those resources which I

[20:21:33 - 20:21:37]
thought was really interesting there was

[20:21:34 - 20:21:39]
also a project that I saw called um bit

[20:21:37 - 20:21:41]
net. CP

[20:21:39 - 20:21:44]
where it's conization to the extreme and

[20:21:41 - 20:21:47]
so it's a Microsoft uh project where a

[20:21:44 - 20:21:48]
parameter is represented literally by a

[20:21:47 - 20:21:51]
zero or a

[20:21:48 - 20:21:52]
one wow it's it's called one bit llm

[20:21:51 - 20:21:55]
it's called a switch right like that

[20:21:52 - 20:21:56]
that's just switching that's transistors

[20:21:55 - 20:21:58]
at their base um but I'm like what could

[20:21:56 - 20:22:00]
you do with that so they had models that

[20:21:58 - 20:22:01]
were like 15 billion parameter ones that

[20:22:00 - 20:22:03]
they shrunk to I don't know but the

[20:22:01 - 20:22:06]
point is is that I tried to get it

[20:22:03 - 20:22:07]
running and it almost worked but uh then

[20:22:06 - 20:22:08]
I had some error and I didn't have time

[20:22:07 - 20:22:10]
to debug it but I just wanted to tell

[20:22:08 - 20:22:12]
you like have you ever seen the one bit

[20:22:10 - 20:22:15]
llms like like that extreme level

[20:22:12 - 20:22:19]
quantization and what would that be used

[20:22:15 - 20:22:21]
for I that sounds like that sounds like

[20:22:19 - 20:22:23]
going back to like switches right like

[20:22:21 - 20:22:26]
complex switch networks where it's kind

[20:22:23 - 20:22:27]
of like yeah no i' I've not seen them I

[20:22:26 - 20:22:30]
I don't know how useful they are to be

[20:22:27 - 20:22:32]
honest with you okay a lot of what llms

[20:22:30 - 20:22:34]
do and and machine learning does is

[20:22:32 - 20:22:38]
because of an activation function which

[20:22:34 - 20:22:41]
kind of um does a lot of abstraction so

[20:22:38 - 20:22:45]
I I assume they're not as powerful

[20:22:41 - 20:22:46]
because of the lack of activation uh I'm

[20:22:45 - 20:22:47]
trying to remember what the original

[20:22:46 - 20:22:49]
machine was called it was called like a

[20:22:47 - 20:22:51]
perceptron or have you heard of this oh

[20:22:49 - 20:22:52]
so you know this machine oh yeah and

[20:22:51 - 20:22:56]
well yeah of course you do

[20:22:52 - 20:22:58]
but but um but um uh I imagine that's

[20:22:56 - 20:23:00]
maybe what it was like maybe maybe those

[20:22:58 - 20:23:03]
were switches back then I don't know or

[20:23:00 - 20:23:07]
um a physical cables wired and they had

[20:23:03 - 20:23:09]
a zero or one but uh yeah so I mean I I

[20:23:07 - 20:23:11]
think that answers quite a lot stuff for

[20:23:09 - 20:23:13]
quantization um now in terms of

[20:23:11 - 20:23:15]
implementing it I find quantization

[20:23:13 - 20:23:17]
really hard to do and every time I see

[20:23:15 - 20:23:20]
it it looks like a bunch of math and a

[20:23:17 - 20:23:22]
bunch of very complex uh stuff so uh I'm

[20:23:20 - 20:23:24]
assuming that's just the nature of it is

[20:23:22 - 20:23:27]
that whatever like quantization is you

[20:23:24 - 20:23:30]
have to know what you're doing to to uh

[20:23:27 - 20:23:32]
to to convert convert these formats and

[20:23:30 - 20:23:34]
and do some rigor roll to get what you

[20:23:32 - 20:23:37]
want so the most important thing is that

[20:23:34 - 20:23:38]
when you see these um these different

[20:23:37 - 20:23:40]
encodings to understand what they are

[20:23:38 - 20:23:42]
and what they link for and you need to

[20:23:40 - 20:23:44]
understand that the encoding comes with

[20:23:42 - 20:23:45]
the model so if the model is looking for

[20:23:44 - 20:23:48]
a particular type of encoding it's not

[20:23:45 - 20:23:52]
for you to you know if you change the

[20:23:48 - 20:23:54]
encoding if you change an fp16 to a bf16

[20:23:52 - 20:23:56]
for example it all of the numbers will

[20:23:54 - 20:23:57]
be off and so them and I don't know that

[20:23:56 - 20:23:59]
I don't know that the software allow you

[20:23:57 - 20:24:02]
I think softwares are smart enough to

[20:23:59 - 20:24:04]
tell you that there's a problem um so so

[20:24:02 - 20:24:06]
so you don't just change the numbers

[20:24:04 - 20:24:09]
it's it's it's it's whatever the the

[20:24:06 - 20:24:10]
factory Manu the factory set it's like

[20:24:09 - 20:24:12]
they say it was trained with this so

[20:24:10 - 20:24:15]
this is what you use this is what you

[20:24:12 - 20:24:19]
use I think I assume that you can change

[20:24:15 - 20:24:21]
the encodings um you can't for it

[20:24:19 - 20:24:23]
probably doesn't make more sense to make

[20:24:21 - 20:24:25]
it more precise um you could probably

[20:24:23 - 20:24:27]
take a model that that is more precise

[20:24:25 - 20:24:30]
and make it less precise I I assume

[20:24:27 - 20:24:31]
there's a lot of uh systems and

[20:24:30 - 20:24:35]
softwares to allow you to do that but

[20:24:31 - 20:24:37]
you need to understand um if if it comes

[20:24:35 - 20:24:40]
with a particular encoding what that is

[20:24:37 - 20:24:44]
and and the fact that that's that's kind

[20:24:40 - 20:24:45]
of part of the data the for for those

[20:24:44 - 20:24:47]
that are listening here is that when we

[20:24:45 - 20:24:49]
start working with models at a lower

[20:24:47 - 20:24:51]
level you have these these uh

[20:24:49 - 20:24:52]
architecture engines that are able to

[20:24:51 - 20:24:56]
run multiple models and you'll have to

[20:24:52 - 20:24:57]
specify the Precision and so you can put

[20:24:56 - 20:25:00]
another number in there it doesn't mean

[20:24:57 - 20:25:01]
you should um and I mean I bet some

[20:25:00 - 20:25:03]
people know what they're doing and can

[20:25:01 - 20:25:04]
change numbers and maybe they get a

[20:25:03 - 20:25:06]
result that they want but it sounds like

[20:25:04 - 20:25:08]
you generally want to use the numbers

[20:25:06 - 20:25:11]
that was recommended based on on

[20:25:08 - 20:25:12]
training or for inference uh for it um

[20:25:11 - 20:25:13]
but yeah that's what that's what I

[20:25:12 - 20:25:15]
always do I just look it up and they say

[20:25:13 - 20:25:16]
use this and I go okay and I don't

[20:25:15 - 20:25:18]
question it but I don't know how they

[20:25:16 - 20:25:20]
came to that but R is saying here it's

[20:25:18 - 20:25:21]
like oh they intentionally made it that

[20:25:20 - 20:25:23]
way and you have to follow follow the

[20:25:21 - 20:25:26]
numbers that were put out there so just

[20:25:23 - 20:25:27]
look it up um that's that's how I

[20:25:26 - 20:25:29]
understand is what you're saying there

[20:25:27 - 20:25:32]
um is there anything else that we want

[20:25:29 - 20:25:35]
to touch on quantization or or or would

[20:25:32 - 20:25:37]
you say we we we got it covered yeah no

[20:25:35 - 20:25:38]
we've got it covered it's just a trick

[20:25:37 - 20:25:39]
and and we're going to do this in the

[20:25:38 - 20:25:41]
course is we're going to look at a lot

[20:25:39 - 20:25:43]
of the tricks that came up to optimize

[20:25:41 - 20:25:46]
these things because of their huge size

[20:25:43 - 20:25:48]
this is a a ram and memory trick cool

[20:25:46 - 20:25:50]
and I appreciate your time and I'm sure

[20:25:48 - 20:25:54]
we'll see you throughout the course uh

[20:25:50 - 20:25:55]
and we'll uh see everyone uh here in the

[20:25:54 - 20:25:57]
the course here I don't know rambling

[20:25:55 - 20:25:59]
here I don't know how to end it but

[20:25:57 - 20:26:03]
we'll we'll see everyone uh some other

[20:25:59 - 20:26:03]
time and uh Chia

[20:26:03 - 20:26:09]
[Music]

[20:26:07 - 20:26:11]
cha hey this is angre brown in this

[20:26:09 - 20:26:14]
video I want to show off pine cone which

[20:26:11 - 20:26:17]
is uh one way that we can uh utilize rag

[20:26:14 - 20:26:18]
systems so let's go ahead and uh sign up

[20:26:17 - 20:26:20]
um I actually might already have an

[20:26:18 - 20:26:22]
account with pinec cone because I have

[20:26:20 - 20:26:24]
used this before um so I'm going to go

[20:26:22 - 20:26:27]
ahead and just log in here and see if I

[20:26:24 - 20:26:29]
can get started that way hopefully it

[20:26:27 - 20:26:30]
just has a yep they do have a continue

[20:26:29 - 20:26:32]
with Google so we'll go ahead and do

[20:26:30 - 20:26:34]
that and so pine cone is one of many

[20:26:32 - 20:26:36]
different kinds of rag databases that we

[20:26:34 - 20:26:38]
can utilize here you can see we have um

[20:26:36 - 20:26:39]
one where we have a quick start I'm

[20:26:38 - 20:26:41]
going to go ahead and just delete that

[20:26:39 - 20:26:43]
here so that we're all kind of starting

[20:26:41 - 20:26:44]
in the same place and so right away we

[20:26:43 - 20:26:46]
already have some code which we can

[20:26:44 - 20:26:48]
start working with so I'm going to go

[20:26:46 - 20:26:49]
over to here onto the left hand side I'm

[20:26:48 - 20:26:51]
going to uh and I already have this

[20:26:49 - 20:26:53]
environment open before if you're

[20:26:51 - 20:26:55]
wondering where this is is where it

[20:26:53 - 20:26:57]
always is which is in the the Gen

[20:26:55 - 20:26:58]
Essentials and I already have um an

[20:26:57 - 20:27:00]
environment launched up here in GitHub

[20:26:58 - 20:27:03]
codes spaces I'm going to go ahead and

[20:27:00 - 20:27:05]
make myself a new folder and we're going

[20:27:03 - 20:27:07]
to type in Pine Cone and we're going to

[20:27:05 - 20:27:09]
go ahead and make ourselves a new Iron

[20:27:07 - 20:27:11]
python on file so this one's going to be

[20:27:09 - 20:27:15]
basic.

[20:27:11 - 20:27:16]
iynb okay and we will go ahead and begin

[20:27:15 - 20:27:18]
following their instructions so the

[20:27:16 - 20:27:19]
first thing they're telling us to do is

[20:27:18 - 20:27:23]
install pine cone so we'll go ahead and

[20:27:19 - 20:27:25]
do that so I'm going to go and run that

[20:27:23 - 20:27:28]
there and while that is going we'll go

[20:27:25 - 20:27:30]
to the next part and so here we have

[20:27:28 - 20:27:33]
some code to initialize pine cone so I'm

[20:27:30 - 20:27:35]
going to go ahead and do that clearly

[20:27:33 - 20:27:38]
there's an API key that's being brought

[20:27:35 - 20:27:41]
into here and so um this is where we're

[20:27:38 - 20:27:42]
going to bring in our usual EnV file and

[20:27:41 - 20:27:44]
we'll bring in

[20:27:42 - 20:27:49]
ourv example

[20:27:44 - 20:27:49]
file um and we'll bring in a DOT get

[20:27:51 - 20:27:56]
ignore okay and in here I'm just going

[20:27:54 - 20:27:57]
to say ignore the. EMV file and I don't

[20:27:56 - 20:28:00]
know what this should be called but I'm

[20:27:57 - 20:28:02]
going to call it pine cone API

[20:28:00 - 20:28:05]
key so that will

[20:28:02 - 20:28:06]
be a good one there so we'll go ahead

[20:28:05 - 20:28:10]
and put that in there as

[20:28:06 - 20:28:12]
well and and so we'll just continue on

[20:28:10 - 20:28:14]
copying the code here as looks like this

[20:28:12 - 20:28:15]
is a very straightforward uh forward way

[20:28:14 - 20:28:18]
to get

[20:28:15 - 20:28:21]
started okay and so then here we would

[20:28:18 - 20:28:22]
want to load in our OS environment so

[20:28:21 - 20:28:24]
probably I always pull from the

[20:28:22 - 20:28:26]
streamlet example not sure why I like to

[20:28:24 - 20:28:28]
do that we'll grab it from here and

[20:28:26 - 20:28:32]
we'll paste this in and this will load

[20:28:28 - 20:28:34]
ourv file so um we can bring in our

[20:28:32 - 20:28:38]
environment variable and so we'll say

[20:28:34 - 20:28:38]
os. Environ

[20:28:40 - 20:28:48]
doget and we'll bring that in we'll just

[20:28:43 - 20:28:48]
say uh pine cone API

[20:28:48 - 20:28:54]
key and we'll go down to the next line

[20:28:51 - 20:28:56]
here and we'll go ahead and copy this

[20:28:54 - 20:28:59]
here and we'll paste this

[20:28:56 - 20:29:02]
in and so we will load that and so that

[20:28:59 - 20:29:05]
will create ourselves a pine cone

[20:29:02 - 20:29:07]
instance says passing open AI config is

[20:29:05 - 20:29:09]
no longer supported please pass the

[20:29:07 - 20:29:11]
proxy URL stuff like that well I'm just

[20:29:09 - 20:29:13]
using whatever you told me to

[20:29:11 - 20:29:15]
use so I'm not sure exactly what the

[20:29:13 - 20:29:16]
problem is you haven't specified an API

[20:29:15 - 20:29:18]
Key Well fair fair enough I haven't

[20:29:16 - 20:29:20]
generated one so I'm going to go here

[20:29:18 - 20:29:21]
and I clearly have a key from before but

[20:29:20 - 20:29:23]
we're going to go ahead and just delete

[20:29:21 - 20:29:25]
out uh this default key we're going to

[20:29:23 - 20:29:28]
generate a new one we'll call it uh

[20:29:25 - 20:29:30]
basic and I'll create that new key and

[20:29:28 - 20:29:33]
I'm going to go ahead and copy this key

[20:29:30 - 20:29:35]
we'll go back over to here and I'm going

[20:29:33 - 20:29:38]
to paste it into

[20:29:35 - 20:29:41]
here okay and then we'll go back over to

[20:29:38 - 20:29:44]
here I'll hit close and so now I should

[20:29:41 - 20:29:47]
have a key so we go back over to here

[20:29:44 - 20:29:49]
I'll scroll up and we'll just run a few

[20:29:47 - 20:29:52]
things so we'll go ahead and run

[20:29:49 - 20:29:55]
this oh sorry we have to reload that and

[20:29:52 - 20:29:58]
then we'll run this and we shouldn't get

[20:29:55 - 20:30:00]
an error now because we have a key right

[20:29:58 - 20:30:02]
so pine cone API key all I can think of

[20:30:00 - 20:30:06]
is I spelled it

[20:30:02 - 20:30:06]
wrong nope it's

[20:30:06 - 20:30:11]
correct so passing open AI config is no

[20:30:09 - 20:30:14]
longer

[20:30:11 - 20:30:17]
supported um you haven't specified an

[20:30:14 - 20:30:19]
API key sure I have it's right here so

[20:30:17 - 20:30:20]
let's go back over to their code example

[20:30:19 - 20:30:24]
getting

[20:30:20 - 20:30:26]
started uh we'll view the guide with

[20:30:24 - 20:30:28]
python oh my goodness just show me how

[20:30:26 - 20:30:32]
to do it okay so we have install py cone

[20:30:28 - 20:30:36]
we did that next set the pine cone API

[20:30:32 - 20:30:39]
key which is what we did we did set it

[20:30:36 - 20:30:41]
here mhm

[20:30:39 - 20:30:43]
and

[20:30:41 - 20:30:45]
then yes and then they want us to

[20:30:43 - 20:30:48]
initialize the client so we go back over

[20:30:45 - 20:30:53]
to here into

[20:30:48 - 20:30:55]
basic and is this the same

[20:30:53 - 20:30:57]
yep so all I'm thinking of is maybe this

[20:30:55 - 20:30:59]
key isn't picking up so sometimes what

[20:30:57 - 20:31:01]
it helps to do is make the API key like

[20:30:59 - 20:31:04]
this we say API key like

[20:31:01 - 20:31:07]
this and do

[20:31:04 - 20:31:09]
that and then paste it like that

[20:31:07 - 20:31:11]
sometimes that can resolve issues for

[20:31:09 - 20:31:13]
unknown

[20:31:11 - 20:31:14]
reasons and I don't know what's going on

[20:31:13 - 20:31:16]
here so I'm going to go ahead and print

[20:31:14 - 20:31:16]
it out

[20:31:17 - 20:31:23]
here I just want to be sure so notice

[20:31:21 - 20:31:23]
it's not printing

[20:31:23 - 20:31:28]
anything well what the

[20:31:26 - 20:31:30]
heck clearly I must be writing something

[20:31:28 - 20:31:33]
wrong because there's no other way so

[20:31:30 - 20:31:33]
I'm going to give this a full

[20:31:34 - 20:31:38]
restart okay and I believe that's been

[20:31:36 - 20:31:39]
restarted I'm just going to start from

[20:31:38 - 20:31:43]
scratch oh you know what I didn't

[20:31:39 - 20:31:44]
include python. DMV that's my problem

[20:31:43 - 20:31:46]
and I'm just going to silence that so

[20:31:44 - 20:31:48]
this is a little bit cleaner and so

[20:31:46 - 20:31:50]
that's why this isn't

[20:31:48 - 20:31:51]
working so I'm just going to take this

[20:31:50 - 20:31:53]
out here I don't want the key to be

[20:31:51 - 20:31:55]
printed and so we'll run this again and

[20:31:53 - 20:31:56]
so we're starting to have less of an

[20:31:55 - 20:31:58]
issue as we go here uh I took out the

[20:31:56 - 20:32:01]
line that I actually wanted this is the

[20:31:58 - 20:32:03]
line that I wanted to go away and now

[20:32:01 - 20:32:06]
we're able to do that and now we can

[20:32:03 - 20:32:06]
initialize our

[20:32:06 - 20:32:10]
index and so we'll give that a moment

[20:32:08 - 20:32:12]
here here it's tell us like what we'd

[20:32:10 - 20:32:14]
like to set as our dimensions and

[20:32:12 - 20:32:17]
cosine um I'm not really worried about

[20:32:14 - 20:32:19]
that right now but if we go over here to

[20:32:17 - 20:32:21]
database this is what we did this is

[20:32:19 - 20:32:22]
generally kind of what we set up here

[20:32:21 - 20:32:24]
now it's interesting down below this one

[20:32:22 - 20:32:26]
is setting up specifically on adabs on

[20:32:24 - 20:32:28]
us East one and actually that's where

[20:32:26 - 20:32:29]
it's setting as well so it is setting up

[20:32:28 - 20:32:31]
here we didn't link our adabs account in

[20:32:29 - 20:32:33]
any way it's just that you're getting to

[20:32:31 - 20:32:34]
choose where you'd like to provision it

[20:32:33 - 20:32:36]
so I'm going to go back over here to

[20:32:34 - 20:32:38]
databases let's go over to indexes and I

[20:32:36 - 20:32:41]
mean I believe that we created it right

[20:32:38 - 20:32:42]
so create this will create the c Index

[20:32:41 - 20:32:43]
named quick start that performs the

[20:32:42 - 20:32:47]
nearest neighbor search using the cosign

[20:32:43 - 20:32:49]
distance metric for uh for number two

[20:32:47 - 20:32:52]
okay that makes sense so shouldn't I be

[20:32:49 - 20:32:56]
able to see this now in the

[20:32:52 - 20:32:58]
interface so maybe there's a bit of a

[20:32:56 - 20:33:00]
delay I mean the next thing we probably

[20:32:58 - 20:33:02]
would want to do is load a data

[20:33:00 - 20:33:05]
set

[20:33:02 - 20:33:09]
um sure I mean we could create uh create

[20:33:05 - 20:33:10]
one down here but

[20:33:09 - 20:33:12]
that's not exactly what I'm looking for

[20:33:10 - 20:33:14]
here so again just trying to figure this

[20:33:12 - 20:33:16]
out

[20:33:14 - 20:33:17]
here we'll go back to the quick start

[20:33:16 - 20:33:20]
and so I have done this before but I'm

[20:33:17 - 20:33:24]
not sure why it's a bit

[20:33:20 - 20:33:27]
finicky okay so we have created

[20:33:24 - 20:33:27]
ourselves an

[20:33:30 - 20:33:36]
index so yeah we'll look at this example

[20:33:32 - 20:33:38]
here so here uh generate vectors so it's

[20:33:36 - 20:33:42]
creating Vector data

[20:33:38 - 20:33:44]
first and then it's creating um an index

[20:33:42 - 20:33:47]
down here below and this one's

[20:33:44 - 20:33:50]
specifically 1024 cosine so the one that

[20:33:47 - 20:33:51]
we created um even if we did create it

[20:33:50 - 20:33:52]
there's not much we're going to be able

[20:33:51 - 20:33:53]
to do with it and I don't think it's

[20:33:52 - 20:33:55]
going to appear until we actually have

[20:33:53 - 20:33:56]
some data in it so I don't think it

[20:33:55 - 20:33:58]
really matters and so this one is not a

[20:33:56 - 20:34:00]
very good example I've done this before

[20:33:58 - 20:34:01]
and I ran into the same problem where uh

[20:34:00 - 20:34:03]
the quick start that they gave you is

[20:34:01 - 20:34:05]
not that that useful so I'm going to go

[20:34:03 - 20:34:07]
up to here and just so that if you are

[20:34:05 - 20:34:10]
following this along as well and you

[20:34:07 - 20:34:14]
want your life to be really easy as I

[20:34:10 - 20:34:16]
like mine to be easy as well that um we

[20:34:14 - 20:34:17]
can uh find this together so I'll just

[20:34:16 - 20:34:18]
paste that into here that quick start

[20:34:17 - 20:34:20]
and so we're going to adjust this based

[20:34:18 - 20:34:21]
on this quick start because I think this

[20:34:20 - 20:34:23]
is the one that we actually want what's

[20:34:21 - 20:34:25]
interesting is this one is saying to

[20:34:23 - 20:34:27]
install without grpc you can do this I'm

[20:34:25 - 20:34:29]
not sure why this one in particular is

[20:34:27 - 20:34:31]
utilizing grpc but that's totally

[20:34:29 - 20:34:33]
fine uh it's using it so maybe we should

[20:34:31 - 20:34:34]
use it as well it's kind of annoying

[20:34:33 - 20:34:37]
that this one is so

[20:34:34 - 20:34:39]
different we'll go over to here grpc is

[20:34:37 - 20:34:40]
just a a communication protocol so

[20:34:39 - 20:34:42]
totally fine that that's what they want

[20:34:40 - 20:34:44]
to do as long as it works that's all I

[20:34:42 - 20:34:45]
care about right so we'll go ahead and

[20:34:44 - 20:34:47]
do

[20:34:45 - 20:34:49]
this

[20:34:47 - 20:34:52]
okay and so I'm just going to change

[20:34:49 - 20:34:54]
this a little bit we'll grab this

[20:34:52 - 20:34:55]
here does not currently take into

[20:34:54 - 20:34:57]
account all packages are installed

[20:34:55 - 20:34:59]
behavior is with the following ceny

[20:34:57 - 20:35:01]
conflicts requires Proto buffer but you

[20:34:59 - 20:35:03]
have which is incompatible you may need

[20:35:01 - 20:35:04]
to restart the kernel for update so

[20:35:03 - 20:35:06]
let's restart

[20:35:04 - 20:35:08]
it this is already kind of annoying

[20:35:06 - 20:35:10]
because we're having Capac abil issues

[20:35:08 - 20:35:12]
now it's not throwing an issue so we'll

[20:35:10 - 20:35:16]
just assume that that fixed our problem

[20:35:12 - 20:35:17]
I'm going to paste this into here um and

[20:35:16 - 20:35:20]
so we still want to do this so that is

[20:35:17 - 20:35:23]
totally fine but then we have some data

[20:35:20 - 20:35:24]
that we might want to embed so we'll go

[20:35:23 - 20:35:26]
down to the next line

[20:35:24 - 20:35:30]
here

[20:35:26 - 20:35:33]
okay and so we have a bunch of

[20:35:30 - 20:35:34]
data okay and then we're giving them IDs

[20:35:33 - 20:35:36]
and we're passing it through the

[20:35:34 - 20:35:39]
embedding and then we're returning back

[20:35:36 - 20:35:41]
embeddings

[20:35:39 - 20:35:42]
PC is not defined I thought it was it's

[20:35:41 - 20:35:45]
right

[20:35:42 - 20:35:48]
here yes sure so run that again and we

[20:35:45 - 20:35:49]
run this again and it's still saying PC

[20:35:48 - 20:35:53]
is not

[20:35:49 - 20:35:54]
defined it's it's totally defined it

[20:35:53 - 20:35:55]
absolutely is defined there's no way

[20:35:54 - 20:35:56]
it's not so we'll go ahead and restart

[20:35:55 - 20:35:59]
this

[20:35:56 - 20:36:01]
again Pine cone's

[20:35:59 - 20:36:03]
great so maybe this actually didn't

[20:36:01 - 20:36:06]
install so let's take out the Q flag

[20:36:03 - 20:36:07]
here and I'm going to bring this one up

[20:36:06 - 20:36:09]
here because I'm I'm assuming that's why

[20:36:07 - 20:36:12]
it's not working and so we'll just say

[20:36:09 - 20:36:15]
pip install over here we'll have that

[20:36:12 - 20:36:18]
separately here and then we'll do this

[20:36:15 - 20:36:20]
one nope says it's working okay great

[20:36:18 - 20:36:22]
then we'll load that again and then

[20:36:20 - 20:36:25]
we'll run this one

[20:36:22 - 20:36:28]
here and no problem now and then we'll

[20:36:25 - 20:36:30]
run this one here and so now there's no

[20:36:28 - 20:36:32]
problem I don't know why sometimes you

[20:36:30 - 20:36:34]
break these up and that fixes the issue

[20:36:32 - 20:36:35]
maybe I don't know I don't know why that

[20:36:34 - 20:36:37]
fixes it but anyway this is going to

[20:36:35 - 20:36:38]
produce some embeddings and so we could

[20:36:37 - 20:36:40]
probably print this out if we wanted to

[20:36:38 - 20:36:41]
see what they look like it's not going

[20:36:40 - 20:36:43]
to be exciting but we'll go ahead and

[20:36:41 - 20:36:45]
print it out anyway so we can see it

[20:36:43 - 20:36:47]
yeah so you can see that embeddings we

[20:36:45 - 20:36:50]
have their data it's a bunch of values

[20:36:47 - 20:36:51]
right okay so we'll go back over to here

[20:36:50 - 20:36:53]
oh they printed that as well okay well

[20:36:51 - 20:36:54]
they were thinking the same thing thing

[20:36:53 - 20:36:56]
as me so then return the objects like

[20:36:54 - 20:36:57]
this yeah we saw that then we're

[20:36:56 - 20:36:58]
creating the index so when you're

[20:36:57 - 20:37:00]
creating the index you really need to

[20:36:58 - 20:37:03]
make sure that uh the dimensions and the

[20:37:00 - 20:37:05]
metric match for what you want to do

[20:37:03 - 20:37:06]
okay at least that's the way I

[20:37:05 - 20:37:08]
understand it and so we'll go here and

[20:37:06 - 20:37:11]
run this

[20:37:08 - 20:37:12]
and so this is going to go ahead and

[20:37:11 - 20:37:15]
create a new

[20:37:12 - 20:37:18]
index um has it provided the data yet I

[20:37:15 - 20:37:19]
don't think so I don't see it here I

[20:37:18 - 20:37:21]
want to go back over to the interface

[20:37:19 - 20:37:22]
and I want to see does this index show

[20:37:21 - 20:37:24]
up because I again I don't think the

[20:37:22 - 20:37:26]
index shows up until you actually have

[20:37:24 - 20:37:27]
data loaded into it so here they're

[20:37:26 - 20:37:30]
saying upsert the vector so this is how

[20:37:27 - 20:37:34]
you'd insert the data into

[20:37:30 - 20:37:37]
here so go ahead and copy that and we'll

[20:37:34 - 20:37:40]
paste this in in down here

[20:37:37 - 20:37:42]
so have upsert upsert count

[20:37:40 - 20:37:44]
six okay so that's

[20:37:42 - 20:37:46]
fine and so now if we go back here and

[20:37:44 - 20:37:48]
then we look at indexes I do believe it

[20:37:46 - 20:37:51]
will appear

[20:37:48 - 20:37:51]
now

[20:37:51 - 20:37:59]
um I don't know why it still refuses to

[20:37:55 - 20:38:01]
appear all projects we have two API Keys

[20:37:59 - 20:38:02]
the other one didn't get deleted okay so

[20:38:01 - 20:38:04]
here they are so it looks like our other

[20:38:02 - 20:38:06]
one was created but for whatever reason

[20:38:04 - 20:38:07]
it just maybe it takes a really long

[20:38:06 - 20:38:09]
time for it to show up so I'm going to

[20:38:07 - 20:38:11]
go ahead and delete this one as I really

[20:38:09 - 20:38:13]
don't care about it but that really did

[20:38:11 - 20:38:14]
confuse me for quite a while can we

[20:38:13 - 20:38:17]
click into it and see what we can look

[20:38:14 - 20:38:18]
at here so we do actually have data down

[20:38:17 - 20:38:20]
below and if we wanted to play around we

[20:38:18 - 20:38:24]
could query it I

[20:38:20 - 20:38:26]
suppose um so yeah I guess there's a

[20:38:24 - 20:38:28]
query thing so yeah we're getting data

[20:38:26 - 20:38:29]
back in this kind of format it's not

[20:38:28 - 20:38:31]
really useful I think we really need to

[20:38:29 - 20:38:34]
attach it to a use case to start making

[20:38:31 - 20:38:36]
sense of this but anyway supposedly we

[20:38:34 - 20:38:38]
have one here let's hit connect and so

[20:38:36 - 20:38:40]
it shows us an example of how we could

[20:38:38 - 20:38:41]
work with it this actually looks like a

[20:38:40 - 20:38:43]
much better example than what we were

[20:38:41 - 20:38:46]
seeing before we'll go back over to here

[20:38:43 - 20:38:47]
and we'll continue on and so here it

[20:38:46 - 20:38:50]
will pine will eventually become

[20:38:47 - 20:38:52]
consistent okay

[20:38:50 - 20:38:55]
and then we can print out the

[20:38:52 - 20:38:56]
information about uh that so now we can

[20:38:55 - 20:38:59]
go ahead and search it let's go ahead

[20:38:56 - 20:38:59]
and search

[20:39:02 - 20:39:06]
it okay we'll go ahead and hit run and

[20:39:04 - 20:39:07]
so now we've performed a search is this

[20:39:06 - 20:39:11]
useful

[20:39:07 - 20:39:13]
um I don't know like I think the way

[20:39:11 - 20:39:15]
this would be useful is if we can see

[20:39:13 - 20:39:17]
integration with a very particular um

[20:39:15 - 20:39:21]
use case so I'm going to go take a look

[20:39:17 - 20:39:24]
and see if we have cooh here um and pine

[20:39:21 - 20:39:26]
cone because I feel that uh Co here is

[20:39:24 - 20:39:28]
really really really good uh connecting

[20:39:26 - 20:39:30]
to external data sources and maybe they

[20:39:28 - 20:39:32]
have a good example of how to do

[20:39:30 - 20:39:33]
integration so we can fully understand

[20:39:32 - 20:39:35]
so let's go take a look and see if we

[20:39:33 - 20:39:37]
can follow this one here we'll call this

[20:39:35 - 20:39:38]
basic for now we'll make a new one here

[20:39:37 - 20:39:42]
and we'll make a new file and we'll call

[20:39:38 - 20:39:45]
this coh here and pine cone Cod here and

[20:39:42 - 20:39:46]
pine cone and see if we can get

[20:39:45 - 20:39:48]
something that actually looks like

[20:39:46 - 20:39:50]
something that is practical because

[20:39:48 - 20:39:52]
right now it's like cool we created a a

[20:39:50 - 20:39:53]
vector store we put data into it but

[20:39:52 - 20:39:55]
what does that even mean doesn't mean a

[20:39:53 - 20:39:57]
whole lot to me right so we'll go over

[20:39:55 - 20:40:00]
to here and we will click on the

[20:39:57 - 20:40:02]
step-by-step guide which is over here

[20:40:00 - 20:40:04]
it's on the pine cone

[20:40:02 - 20:40:05]
website and it looks like they already

[20:40:04 - 20:40:08]
have some collab

[20:40:05 - 20:40:10]
code so here we're going to install CO

[20:40:08 - 20:40:13]
here so we'll bring that on

[20:40:10 - 20:40:15]
over and we'll just do this step by

[20:40:13 - 20:40:20]
step

[20:40:15 - 20:40:22]
okay so we'll add a new one here um

[20:40:20 - 20:40:25]
what's the hyphen U flag for hyphen U

[20:40:22 - 20:40:28]
flag uh pip what is it I really don't

[20:40:25 - 20:40:30]
know is it like Universal is a flag that

[20:40:28 - 20:40:31]
tells pip to install library to the

[20:40:30 - 20:40:33]
current user only inste the GL globally

[20:40:31 - 20:40:34]
for everyone I don't think this really

[20:40:33 - 20:40:36]
matters so I'm going to go ahead and

[20:40:34 - 20:40:37]
just take that out um and we'll go ahead

[20:40:36 - 20:40:41]
and run that actually we missing one we

[20:40:37 - 20:40:43]
want python. EnV in here as well so I'm

[20:40:41 - 20:40:44]
going to just stop this here and then

[20:40:43 - 20:40:45]
we'll run that again and as that is

[20:40:44 - 20:40:47]
running it's going to have a lot of

[20:40:45 - 20:40:49]
output we'll go back to our other one

[20:40:47 - 20:40:54]
here and we're going to go and we're

[20:40:49 - 20:40:57]
going to grab um this example code where

[20:40:54 - 20:41:01]
we can import

[20:40:57 - 20:41:02]
our uh ourv we'll probably have to do

[20:41:01 - 20:41:05]
this twice because we'll need it for coh

[20:41:02 - 20:41:06]
here so I'm just going to be a bit

[20:41:05 - 20:41:08]
proactive here and go ahead and set up

[20:41:06 - 20:41:11]
my coh here API as well so I'm going to

[20:41:08 - 20:41:12]
go here just say coher API key and as we

[20:41:11 - 20:41:15]
learned coh here has a very generous

[20:41:12 - 20:41:15]
free tier so it is great for us to learn

[20:41:15 - 20:41:18]
using

[20:41:15 - 20:41:20]
it so we'll go ahead and say coh here

[20:41:18 - 20:41:23]
API

[20:41:20 - 20:41:25]
key and I'm going to go over to here I'm

[20:41:23 - 20:41:28]
going to sign in I signed in with my

[20:41:25 - 20:41:30]
Google Cloud account or Gmail account on

[20:41:28 - 20:41:32]
the left hand side I'm looking for API

[20:41:30 - 20:41:34]
keys and I'm going to generate a new

[20:41:32 - 20:41:37]
oops not a production key a new trial

[20:41:34 - 20:41:39]
key this will just be for pine cone and

[20:41:37 - 20:41:40]
we'll generate out that key I'm going to

[20:41:39 - 20:41:43]
copy that key we're going to make our

[20:41:40 - 20:41:45]
way back over to here I'm going to paste

[20:41:43 - 20:41:47]
in that coher key now I have the two

[20:41:45 - 20:41:48]
components that I need to complete this

[20:41:47 - 20:41:51]
let's make our way back over to the

[20:41:48 - 20:41:53]
documentation of this example and so yes

[20:41:51 - 20:41:55]
we're going to load the the coher client

[20:41:53 - 20:41:57]
I wonder if this is going to use the old

[20:41:55 - 20:41:58]
API I keep coming across the old API

[20:41:57 - 20:42:00]
more frequently which is kind of

[20:41:58 - 20:42:02]
annoying but if the old API works that's

[20:42:00 - 20:42:04]
totally fine it just might date our code

[20:42:02 - 20:42:05]
a bit um and I believe that we already

[20:42:04 - 20:42:07]
set this correctly so we'll just go

[20:42:05 - 20:42:08]
ahead and leave that empty I'm going to

[20:42:07 - 20:42:11]
reload that so that coh here will get

[20:42:08 - 20:42:13]
loaded in um and we'll go back to this

[20:42:11 - 20:42:15]
example and so here it's saying load in

[20:42:13 - 20:42:19]
from data sets did we import that

[20:42:15 - 20:42:21]
earlier um so if we go here did data

[20:42:19 - 20:42:23]
sets get imported it did okay great so

[20:42:21 - 20:42:25]
data sets is where we're pulling data

[20:42:23 - 20:42:27]
from hugging face and so we're going to

[20:42:25 - 20:42:30]
go ahead and grab this as our next line

[20:42:27 - 20:42:33]
and we'll hit plus okay and so now we're

[20:42:30 - 20:42:34]
bringing in that data set uh one called

[20:42:33 - 20:42:35]
track I'm not sure what track is let's

[20:42:34 - 20:42:39]
go take a look at what that is hugging

[20:42:35 - 20:42:39]
face data set

[20:42:40 - 20:42:46]
and this data set is

[20:42:43 - 20:42:48]
what the text retrieval conference

[20:42:46 - 20:42:50]
question classification data set

[20:42:48 - 20:42:53]
contains 5,500 labeled questions and

[20:42:50 - 20:42:56]
training sets another so how did search

[20:42:53 - 20:42:58]
and develop in and leave Russia okay so

[20:42:56 - 20:43:00]
that's kind of an idea of like what that

[20:42:58 - 20:43:02]
data set looks like let's go back over

[20:43:00 - 20:43:03]
to here and continue on and see if we

[20:43:02 - 20:43:06]
can get full

[20:43:03 - 20:43:08]
integration um this is just I think a

[20:43:06 - 20:43:10]
duplicate okay we'll go back over to

[20:43:08 - 20:43:11]
here so we are importing that data set

[20:43:10 - 20:43:15]
the next thing we want to do is create

[20:43:11 - 20:43:17]
embeddings of the data so we were using

[20:43:15 - 20:43:18]
um the embedding model from Pine Cone

[20:43:17 - 20:43:21]
but this one we were actually using the

[20:43:18 - 20:43:23]
embedding model from coh here often um

[20:43:21 - 20:43:24]
if you're going to do embeddings you

[20:43:23 - 20:43:26]
want to actually I guess it doesn't

[20:43:24 - 20:43:28]
really matter the model the the the

[20:43:26 - 20:43:30]
large language model doesn't care what

[20:43:28 - 20:43:32]
embeddings you use but um the embedding

[20:43:30 - 20:43:34]
model matters for what you store based

[20:43:32 - 20:43:36]
on what kind of result you want so

[20:43:34 - 20:43:38]
there's no correlation in that sense but

[20:43:36 - 20:43:39]
anyway so check the dimensionality of

[20:43:38 - 20:43:40]
the return vectors you will need to save

[20:43:39 - 20:43:42]
the embedding dimensionality for this to

[20:43:40 - 20:43:43]
be used with initializing pine cone

[20:43:42 - 20:43:45]
later on so that's something I was kind

[20:43:43 - 20:43:47]
of wondering it's like how do you know

[20:43:45 - 20:43:48]
what to set the dimensionality of of and

[20:43:47 - 20:43:51]
I guess this is the way that you would

[20:43:48 - 20:43:53]
do it so that's kind of

[20:43:51 - 20:43:55]
cool now I'm not sure how we would know

[20:43:53 - 20:43:56]
whether this set to cosine or not or

[20:43:55 - 20:43:58]
whatever other setting we have now that

[20:43:56 - 20:44:00]
you have the embeding you can move onto

[20:43:58 - 20:44:04]
the indexing them into pine cone Vector

[20:44:00 - 20:44:08]
database so we will grab this part

[20:44:04 - 20:44:10]
next okay we'll hit Plus

[20:44:08 - 20:44:11]
and so we have our pine cone API I'm

[20:44:10 - 20:44:12]
just going to take this out because I'm

[20:44:11 - 20:44:15]
going to assume that it will load load

[20:44:12 - 20:44:17]
it based on its name maybe it won't and

[20:44:15 - 20:44:18]
so it's using cosine so I guess that

[20:44:17 - 20:44:21]
must be good it's going to host it on ad

[20:44:18 - 20:44:24]
of us which is totally

[20:44:21 - 20:44:25]
fine uh now you can be begin populating

[20:44:24 - 20:44:27]
the table so we'll go ahead and copy

[20:44:25 - 20:44:31]
this this looks

[20:44:27 - 20:44:34]
like us putting data into it so we'll go

[20:44:31 - 20:44:35]
here and yes so here it is iterating

[20:44:34 - 20:44:38]
through the

[20:44:35 - 20:44:39]
data and

[20:44:38 - 20:44:41]
I'm assuming at this point it's already

[20:44:39 - 20:44:43]
been turned into embeddings right so we

[20:44:41 - 20:44:46]
have embeds

[20:44:43 - 20:44:46]
here yes

[20:44:47 - 20:44:51]
so yep and then this is inserting into

[20:44:49 - 20:44:55]
the pine cone database okay that makes

[20:44:51 - 20:44:55]
sense and then we have our semantic

[20:44:57 - 20:45:04]
search okay so what caused the 1929

[20:45:02 - 20:45:07]
Great Depression and so here it would

[20:45:04 - 20:45:07]
return the result

[20:45:08 - 20:45:11]
the response from Pine code includes the

[20:45:09 - 20:45:13]
original text of the metadata so we'll

[20:45:11 - 20:45:13]
go ahead and copy

[20:45:14 - 20:45:18]
this and then we'll go back over to here

[20:45:16 - 20:45:20]
looks good let's make it harder and

[20:45:18 - 20:45:21]
replace depression with the incorrect

[20:45:20 - 20:45:23]
recession amount so here they're

[20:45:21 - 20:45:25]
purposely matching it a little bit

[20:45:23 - 20:45:26]
differently I don't care about that too

[20:45:25 - 20:45:29]
much I just want to see that we get this

[20:45:26 - 20:45:31]
working end to end now this is still not

[20:45:29 - 20:45:32]
integrated with an llm but the idea is

[20:45:31 - 20:45:34]
that you would that data you return back

[20:45:32 - 20:45:36]
you just put it in the context window so

[20:45:34 - 20:45:37]
you know when you'd give it a prompt

[20:45:36 - 20:45:39]
you'd put it in the promp and that' be

[20:45:37 - 20:45:41]
in context learning but let's make sure

[20:45:39 - 20:45:43]
that we can get this to work so we ran

[20:45:41 - 20:45:46]
this line already I'm going to run this

[20:45:43 - 20:45:48]
one again let's go run a CO here and

[20:45:46 - 20:45:51]
hopefully it loads it then we'll load in

[20:45:48 - 20:45:55]
our data set then we will wait a moment

[20:45:51 - 20:45:55]
here we'll give it a

[20:45:55 - 20:45:59]
moment all right so this is taking a

[20:45:58 - 20:46:01]
long time because it's trying to load

[20:45:59 - 20:46:02]
the first 10,000 rows and this is just

[20:46:01 - 20:46:04]
tiring me out so I'm going to hit stop

[20:46:02 - 20:46:06]
here just stop stop stop stop stop this

[20:46:04 - 20:46:09]
is ridiculous and I'm going to just

[20:46:06 - 20:46:10]
reduce this to maybe 100 first ones and

[20:46:09 - 20:46:13]
maybe that will make our lives a lot

[20:46:10 - 20:46:14]
easier so just hit cancel here yes I

[20:46:13 - 20:46:17]
want to interrupt

[20:46:14 - 20:46:19]
it what a pain in the

[20:46:17 - 20:46:20]
butt sometimes the people that write

[20:46:19 - 20:46:22]
these examples aren't the ones that

[20:46:20 - 20:46:24]
actually utilize them and so that's

[20:46:22 - 20:46:25]
where it gets kind of frustrating so I

[20:46:24 - 20:46:28]
am hitting stop here and I'll just hit

[20:46:25 - 20:46:30]
restart so that the kernel stops here um

[20:46:28 - 20:46:32]
and because it did restart it I'm going

[20:46:30 - 20:46:34]
to just go from the top here I'm going

[20:46:32 - 20:46:35]
to assume that it's lost that context

[20:46:34 - 20:46:37]
and so we'll go ahead here and this time

[20:46:35 - 20:46:39]
it's going to load 100 as opposed to a

[20:46:37 - 20:46:40]
thousand and maybe this one will be a

[20:46:39 - 20:46:43]
lot more reasonable so we'll just wait a

[20:46:40 - 20:46:44]
little bit here okay all right so this

[20:46:43 - 20:46:49]
one's also having a really hard time

[20:46:44 - 20:46:50]
with it um this repos oh hold on hold on

[20:46:49 - 20:46:52]
this repos track contains custom code

[20:46:50 - 20:46:54]
which must be executed correctly to load

[20:46:52 - 20:46:56]
the data you can inspect the repository

[20:46:54 - 20:46:58]
you can avoid this prompt in the future

[20:46:56 - 20:46:59]
by oh did I just have to press yes up

[20:46:58 - 20:47:01]
here the entire time and I hadn't been

[20:46:59 - 20:47:04]
paying

[20:47:01 - 20:47:05]
attention did that fix it why does it

[20:47:04 - 20:47:08]
look failed now let's go ahead and try

[20:47:05 - 20:47:08]
this one more time

[20:47:09 - 20:47:16]
and I'll say why and then

[20:47:13 - 20:47:18]
enter okay so maybe a th wasn't that uh

[20:47:16 - 20:47:20]
bad to begin with but I only want a 100

[20:47:18 - 20:47:22]
to be honest no okay let's go do a th

[20:47:20 - 20:47:24]
maybe a th wasn't that bad and it was

[20:47:22 - 20:47:26]
just me that was the problem this entire

[20:47:24 - 20:47:28]
time okay so that's the problem I was

[20:47:26 - 20:47:31]
waiting here I wasn't reading I was

[20:47:28 - 20:47:34]
confused I do apologize let's go ahead

[20:47:31 - 20:47:37]
and continue on so now we are um

[20:47:34 - 20:47:39]
embedding the text of track so there we

[20:47:37 - 20:47:40]
go so we literally did a th000 beddings

[20:47:39 - 20:47:42]
here we're grabbing the shape so we see

[20:47:40 - 20:47:44]
1,00 to

[20:47:42 - 20:47:46]
1,24 so it looks like it wants the

[20:47:44 - 20:47:48]
second one here so that kind of makes

[20:47:46 - 20:47:50]
sense um then down below here we are

[20:47:48 - 20:47:53]
connecting to pine cones so let's go

[20:47:50 - 20:47:56]
ahead and see if that works here it says

[20:47:53 - 20:47:57]
name serve L spec is not

[20:47:56 - 20:48:00]
defined

[20:47:57 - 20:48:04]
um fair

[20:48:00 - 20:48:04]
enough can we just do this

[20:48:06 - 20:48:11]
I think that's working and so I believe

[20:48:09 - 20:48:13]
it is creating the index now and there

[20:48:11 - 20:48:16]
we go so the next thing is we're going

[20:48:13 - 20:48:19]
to upsert or insert the data into the

[20:48:16 - 20:48:22]
database upsert as and send it up to the

[20:48:19 - 20:48:24]
database and so now the data has been

[20:48:22 - 20:48:25]
inserted um I'm not sure if we have to

[20:48:24 - 20:48:27]
wait for that to become eventually

[20:48:25 - 20:48:29]
consistent but let's go ahead and see if

[20:48:27 - 20:48:33]
we can query it so here it says what

[20:48:29 - 20:48:35]
caused the 1929 1929 Great Depression

[20:48:33 - 20:48:37]
and here we're using the co- embedding

[20:48:35 - 20:48:39]
model so we have to embed our query

[20:48:37 - 20:48:42]
first right and then we can query

[20:48:39 - 20:48:43]
against it um and so I believe yeah this

[20:48:42 - 20:48:45]
is the index that's coming from Pine

[20:48:43 - 20:48:46]
Cone and then we can query that and see

[20:48:45 - 20:48:49]
what we get and then we can print out a

[20:48:46 - 20:48:51]
results and so here we go we have some

[20:48:49 - 20:48:53]
results being returned back to us and so

[20:48:51 - 20:48:55]
this is an integration of rag this is

[20:48:53 - 20:48:57]
not a complete integration because

[20:48:55 - 20:49:01]
obviously you'd want to take this data

[20:48:57 - 20:49:03]
back to the llm right and and put it in

[20:49:01 - 20:49:04]
context window but I think that's pretty

[20:49:03 - 20:49:06]
straightforward so I don't plan to show

[20:49:04 - 20:49:08]
it here and we're going to call this one

[20:49:06 - 20:49:10]
uh done and dusted so we'll go here just

[20:49:08 - 20:49:13]
make sure I'm not committing keys and

[20:49:10 - 20:49:15]
this will be our example with pine cone

[20:49:13 - 20:49:17]
and so that is your first example of

[20:49:15 - 20:49:21]
utilizing rag okay

[20:49:17 - 20:49:23]
[Music]

[20:49:21 - 20:49:24]
ciao hey it's angrew brown and one

[20:49:23 - 20:49:27]
solution I would like to look at is

[20:49:24 - 20:49:30]
elastic so uh elastic search is

[20:49:27 - 20:49:31]
definitely something that uh you'll hear

[20:49:30 - 20:49:33]
again and again when talking about rag

[20:49:31 - 20:49:36]
systems because having full Tech search

[20:49:33 - 20:49:38]
engine works really really well for rag

[20:49:36 - 20:49:40]
um obviously ad us has a solution and

[20:49:38 - 20:49:42]
some other providers do but I was

[20:49:40 - 20:49:45]
thinking maybe we could go directly to

[20:49:42 - 20:49:47]
elastic and I wonder if I can make um a

[20:49:45 - 20:49:50]
trial without entering my credit card in

[20:49:47 - 20:49:52]
I'm not sure if I can but um we'll go

[20:49:50 - 20:49:55]
take a look here so does

[20:49:52 - 20:49:58]
elastic have a free

[20:49:55 - 20:50:00]
trial no credit card let's see if it

[20:49:58 - 20:50:02]
does because if it does then we can try

[20:50:00 - 20:50:04]
to utilize it right no credit card

[20:50:02 - 20:50:06]
required it's saying so if that's the

[20:50:04 - 20:50:07]
case we'll go ahead and we'll go ahead

[20:50:06 - 20:50:09]
and continue

[20:50:07 - 20:50:12]
here I'm going to say exam Pro Co we'll

[20:50:09 - 20:50:14]
continue on as elastic I feel is

[20:50:12 - 20:50:15]
something that you know if you were to

[20:50:14 - 20:50:17]
use something production elastic would

[20:50:15 - 20:50:18]
be really good manga Tob as well would

[20:50:17 - 20:50:22]
be really good so I'm going to go ahead

[20:50:18 - 20:50:22]
and just fill in my

[20:50:23 - 20:50:27]
information okay we'll go ahead and

[20:50:24 - 20:50:28]
continue I'm a new to elastic I have

[20:50:27 - 20:50:31]
some experience with elastic but it's

[20:50:28 - 20:50:34]
been a while um just evaluate it I

[20:50:31 - 20:50:37]
suppose and so we have a few options we

[20:50:34 - 20:50:39]
have elastic search elastic for

[20:50:37 - 20:50:41]
observability elastic for security we're

[20:50:39 - 20:50:44]
just going with regular elastic search

[20:50:41 - 20:50:46]
here today and uh we can say where we

[20:50:44 - 20:50:49]
can host it I'm totally fine with gcp I

[20:50:46 - 20:50:51]
do not care where it's going here today

[20:50:49 - 20:50:52]
but it's nice we have some options looks

[20:50:51 - 20:50:55]
like we got a

[20:50:52 - 20:50:57]
video um here that we can watch while

[20:50:55 - 20:50:58]
we're hanging out but we are going to

[20:50:57 - 20:51:00]
hang out until it's done which

[20:50:58 - 20:51:01]
apparently it looks like it's going

[20:51:00 - 20:51:03]
really quick so it's not even 3 to 5

[20:51:01 - 20:51:05]
minutes unless there is some post stuff

[20:51:03 - 20:51:07]
that we have to wait for but let's get

[20:51:05 - 20:51:09]
into elastic here here and we'll go

[20:51:07 - 20:51:11]
ahead and close this out and so we have

[20:51:09 - 20:51:13]
an elastic search endpoint that we can

[20:51:11 - 20:51:15]
utilize um so the question is how can we

[20:51:13 - 20:51:17]
start building with this let's go take a

[20:51:15 - 20:51:18]
look at the playground I haven't used

[20:51:17 - 20:51:19]
the elastic search interface here so

[20:51:18 - 20:51:22]
this is my first time in here but I have

[20:51:19 - 20:51:24]
worked with elastic so I'm not super

[20:51:22 - 20:51:25]
worried about it but right away it says

[20:51:24 - 20:51:27]
experiment with combining elastic search

[20:51:25 - 20:51:28]
data with powerful large language models

[20:51:27 - 20:51:30]
that sounds perfect that's exactly what

[20:51:28 - 20:51:32]
we want and we do want to connect it to

[20:51:30 - 20:51:34]
an llm so let's go ahead and take a look

[20:51:32 - 20:51:37]
here so we have a few options Amazon

[20:51:34 - 20:51:39]
Bedrock Google Gemini open a I feel like

[20:51:37 - 20:51:41]
I'm not using Google Gemini enough so

[20:51:39 - 20:51:43]
let's go ahead and take a look here so

[20:51:41 - 20:51:46]
send a request to Google Gemini so we

[20:51:43 - 20:51:47]
would um let's see we would add a

[20:51:46 - 20:51:50]
connector

[20:51:47 - 20:51:52]
name uh oh so we'd specify a project

[20:51:50 - 20:51:53]
with a very specific model yeah I'm just

[20:51:52 - 20:51:55]
curious what does the other ones look

[20:51:53 - 20:51:57]
like maybe open AI is much easier to

[20:51:55 - 20:51:59]
utilize yes here it's so much more

[20:51:57 - 20:52:01]
straightforward I think I prefer that so

[20:51:59 - 20:52:04]
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to

[20:52:01 - 20:52:05]
go and use the open AI one sorry Google

[20:52:04 - 20:52:07]
you just made it too much work when I

[20:52:05 - 20:52:08]
have to make a new project I don't feel

[20:52:07 - 20:52:11]
like doing that here today though I did

[20:52:08 - 20:52:13]
create a geni project so it isn't really

[20:52:11 - 20:52:16]
that much of an issue to figure out um

[20:52:13 - 20:52:18]
so I'm being a little bit um a bit of a

[20:52:16 - 20:52:21]
pain in the butt but we'll go here and

[20:52:18 - 20:52:22]
just make sure I'm logged in uh there's

[20:52:21 - 20:52:24]
a video where we do this so you should

[20:52:22 - 20:52:26]
already have an openi account and we'll

[20:52:24 - 20:52:28]
go over and I already have a project for

[20:52:26 - 20:52:29]
basic I'm just going to work with that

[20:52:28 - 20:52:32]
project I'm totally fine with it if you

[20:52:29 - 20:52:34]
don't have one go make a new project but

[20:52:32 - 20:52:37]
we're going to go over to this project

[20:52:34 - 20:52:39]
in particular m we'll say manage

[20:52:37 - 20:52:40]
projects then we'll go to API keys and I

[20:52:39 - 20:52:42]
already have a key here I'm going to

[20:52:40 - 20:52:45]
revoke it I'm going to generate a new

[20:52:42 - 20:52:47]
key this is going to be for

[20:52:45 - 20:52:49]
elastic I'm just going to put in my

[20:52:47 - 20:52:50]
basic project I'm going to go ahead and

[20:52:49 - 20:52:52]
create that and now I have a key we'll

[20:52:50 - 20:52:55]
copy that we'll make our way back over

[20:52:52 - 20:52:57]
to here I'll paste in my key now I do

[20:52:55 - 20:52:59]
have a bit of spend on on my open AI so

[20:52:57 - 20:53:03]
this is less of an issue so just say

[20:52:59 - 20:53:03]
open AI connection and that is our

[20:53:03 - 20:53:07]
provider I guess there's other

[20:53:05 - 20:53:09]
compatible ones that's kind of cool so

[20:53:07 - 20:53:10]
we'll go ahead and hit save so that

[20:53:09 - 20:53:12]
makes me think that as long as you have

[20:53:10 - 20:53:14]
an open AI compatible interface it can

[20:53:12 - 20:53:16]
work with it so now I've connected an

[20:53:14 - 20:53:17]
llm let's go ahead and create ourselves

[20:53:16 - 20:53:20]
an

[20:53:17 - 20:53:23]
index this seems like a really easy way

[20:53:20 - 20:53:24]
to make a rag and so we have API so use

[20:53:23 - 20:53:28]
the API to connect directly to your

[20:53:24 - 20:53:30]
elastic um uh interface uh discover

[20:53:28 - 20:53:32]
extract uh index searchable content from

[20:53:30 - 20:53:34]
websites oo I like that and then we also

[20:53:32 - 20:53:37]
have connectors let's go ahead and crawl

[20:53:34 - 20:53:40]
a URL so this index will hold the data

[20:53:37 - 20:53:41]
content sourced so uh maybe we'll just

[20:53:40 - 20:53:44]
type

[20:53:41 - 20:53:45]
in I don't know let's just try exam Pro

[20:53:44 - 20:53:46]
because I don't mind scraping exam Pro

[20:53:45 - 20:53:49]
for

[20:53:46 - 20:53:51]
content and add a domain to your index

[20:53:49 - 20:53:54]
so configure a domain you'd like to

[20:53:51 - 20:53:55]
crawl so we type in www. exampro doco

[20:53:54 - 20:53:56]
this is going to totally mess up my data

[20:53:55 - 20:53:58]
I probably shouldn't tell people to do

[20:53:56 - 20:54:02]
that but we'll go here we'll add the

[20:53:58 - 20:54:04]
domain and now we have I guess a crawler

[20:54:02 - 20:54:06]
we'll go ahead and hit crawl crawl all

[20:54:04 - 20:54:08]
domains crawl all domains on this here

[20:54:06 - 20:54:10]
so we'll go ahead and press

[20:54:08 - 20:54:13]
that it's a static website so you can't

[20:54:10 - 20:54:16]
really hurt it don't do app. exampro

[20:54:13 - 20:54:18]
doco that'd be really annoying do www.

[20:54:16 - 20:54:20]
exampro doco and so now it's running a

[20:54:18 - 20:54:22]
WebCrawler this is incredible how easy

[20:54:20 - 20:54:28]
this

[20:54:22 - 20:54:31]
is sorry Amazon Bedrock uh um knowledge

[20:54:28 - 20:54:33]
base which uses elastic search or

[20:54:31 - 20:54:35]
whatever their variant is underneath but

[20:54:33 - 20:54:36]
honestly elastic search is the main

[20:54:35 - 20:54:38]
website here this one we're utilizing

[20:54:36 - 20:54:40]
it's probably a lot easier so I think

[20:54:38 - 20:54:42]
that it's crawled um what has done I'm

[20:54:40 - 20:54:44]
not sure but let's go view that in the

[20:54:42 - 20:54:49]
playground and

[20:54:44 - 20:54:54]
see what we know about it so how many

[20:54:49 - 20:54:56]
courses are on exampro doco can it

[20:54:54 - 20:54:59]
answer

[20:54:56 - 20:55:01]
that Pro cont does not specify the exact

[20:54:59 - 20:55:03]
number of courses available on COD

[20:55:01 - 20:55:07]
therefore I don't know the answer okay

[20:55:03 - 20:55:09]
so let's go to the exampro doco website

[20:55:07 - 20:55:11]
and we have a Boxing Day Sale obviously

[20:55:09 - 20:55:12]
you can see the time of this if we go

[20:55:11 - 20:55:14]
down

[20:55:12 - 20:55:15]
below who is your favorite instructor

[20:55:14 - 20:55:20]
okay

[20:55:15 - 20:55:24]
so let's go over here and say on exampro

[20:55:20 - 20:55:28]
doco who who is the favorite

[20:55:24 - 20:55:28]
instructor can I do

[20:55:28 - 20:55:32]
that and so it says according to the

[20:55:30 - 20:55:34]
context provided Andrew Brown is

[20:55:32 - 20:55:36]
mentioned as a favorite Cloud instructor

[20:55:34 - 20:55:38]
on exam proo he is described as an abis

[20:55:36 - 20:55:40]
Community hero gcp Champion innovator

[20:55:38 - 20:55:42]
not anymore I got to take that off the

[20:55:40 - 20:55:43]
thing and previously CTO of multiple

[20:55:42 - 20:55:46]
startups so if we go over here we can

[20:55:43 - 20:55:47]
view the code for the implementation and

[20:55:46 - 20:55:48]
right off the bat it's giving us the

[20:55:47 - 20:55:50]
open Ai and elastic search

[20:55:48 - 20:55:53]
implementation that is really awesome

[20:55:50 - 20:55:57]
I'm going to go over to here and we're

[20:55:53 - 20:55:57]
just going to go directly over to gen

[20:55:59 - 20:56:05]
Essentials exam proo geni

[20:56:02 - 20:56:06]
Essentials and uh I might already have

[20:56:05 - 20:56:08]
an environment running I do so I'm going

[20:56:06 - 20:56:10]
to go ahead and open that up and I just

[20:56:08 - 20:56:11]
want to bring that code over and make

[20:56:10 - 20:56:14]
sure that we can execute it

[20:56:11 - 20:56:15]
programmatically all right so we now

[20:56:14 - 20:56:18]
have uh this open here I'm going to make

[20:56:15 - 20:56:18]
a new one here for elastic

[20:56:19 - 20:56:24]
Surge and we'll go ahead and make a new

[20:56:22 - 20:56:27]
file called basic.

[20:56:24 - 20:56:30]
iynb um I'm going to go and make a DOT a

[20:56:27 - 20:56:30]
newv

[20:56:31 - 20:56:38]
here and we'll make a

[20:56:34 - 20:56:41]
newv example and we'll make a a new dotg

[20:56:38 - 20:56:44]
ignore okay so what we'll do is we'll go

[20:56:41 - 20:56:45]
over to elastic and we have a bunch of

[20:56:44 - 20:56:46]
application code there's a lot

[20:56:45 - 20:56:48]
apparently you can use it with Lang

[20:56:46 - 20:56:50]
chain I would not use Lang chain I'm so

[20:56:48 - 20:56:52]
sorry I'm just done with Lang chain

[20:56:50 - 20:56:54]
these days we'll go ahead and go all the

[20:56:52 - 20:56:57]
way down to the ground we'll copy this

[20:56:54 - 20:56:58]
and we'll go back over to here uh and

[20:56:57 - 20:57:00]
we'll paste it in uh no we got to go

[20:56:58 - 20:57:01]
over here and we'll make a new code

[20:57:00 - 20:57:03]
block and then another new code block

[20:57:01 - 20:57:04]
and we'll paste it in we'll break this

[20:57:03 - 20:57:07]
up a little bit so I'm going to bring

[20:57:04 - 20:57:08]
these up into another line line here

[20:57:07 - 20:57:10]
then we'll bring this up into here I

[20:57:08 - 20:57:12]
like how they give you the PIP wow this

[20:57:10 - 20:57:15]
is super easy um I do want to be quiet

[20:57:12 - 20:57:17]
but I don't need the U so we'll say

[20:57:15 - 20:57:20]
python. EnV so we are installing the

[20:57:17 - 20:57:23]
three things that we are

[20:57:20 - 20:57:25]
utilizing and then we'll do this we also

[20:57:23 - 20:57:27]
need to bring

[20:57:25 - 20:57:28]
in EnV to load it so I'm going to bring

[20:57:27 - 20:57:31]
these three lines in from another

[20:57:28 - 20:57:33]
project saying there's no module called

[20:57:31 - 20:57:34]
elastic search could not find a version

[20:57:33 - 20:57:37]
that satisfies the requirements for

[20:57:34 - 20:57:39]
python. EnV it's CU I spelled it wrong

[20:57:37 - 20:57:40]
it's got to be like this so we'll adjust

[20:57:39 - 20:57:42]
that and that should fix that

[20:57:40 - 20:57:44]
installation there we don't need to

[20:57:42 - 20:57:47]
double import OS so we'll just take that

[20:57:44 - 20:57:49]
out here and we'll run this one and we

[20:57:47 - 20:57:50]
don't have an EMV file yet so that will

[20:57:49 - 20:57:52]
be something we'll need to work on here

[20:57:50 - 20:57:55]
we have an endpoint and then we have

[20:57:52 - 20:57:56]
esapi and uh this stuff so I'm going to

[20:57:55 - 20:58:00]
split the screen here so I can see what

[20:57:56 - 20:58:06]
I'm doing and we'll write in uh open AI

[20:58:00 - 20:58:09]
open API open AI API key so that one we

[20:58:06 - 20:58:12]
have es API key which is another one we

[20:58:09 - 20:58:13]
have es endpoint which will be this one

[20:58:12 - 20:58:15]
we don't really need to load it this way

[20:58:13 - 20:58:16]
but I would prefer to do it that way so

[20:58:15 - 20:58:19]
I'm going to just take this out of here

[20:58:16 - 20:58:21]
like that and we'll paste it into whoops

[20:58:19 - 20:58:23]
actually before we do that um I want to

[20:58:21 - 20:58:25]
make sure that I copy these and we put

[20:58:23 - 20:58:27]
them into here let's make sure our dotg

[20:58:25 - 20:58:30]
ignore we are ignoring the EnV as I

[20:58:27 - 20:58:32]
don't not feel like committing uh

[20:58:30 - 20:58:34]
anything sensitive here today we'll go

[20:58:32 - 20:58:37]
back over to here and we are going to

[20:58:34 - 20:58:39]
grab the elas CLC search

[20:58:37 - 20:58:42]
endpoint as

[20:58:39 - 20:58:46]
such um here and then we'll need those

[20:58:42 - 20:58:50]
keys there so here we'll say os. Environ

[20:58:46 - 20:58:52]
doget and this is going to be uh es

[20:58:50 - 20:58:53]
endpoint and yes you can do it this way

[20:58:52 - 20:58:58]
too but I'm going to stick with the

[20:58:53 - 20:58:58]
doget syntax I just dress it

[20:58:59 - 20:59:04]
more even though they both

[20:59:02 - 20:59:05]
work I don't know I think one time I did

[20:59:04 - 20:59:07]
it and it didn't work and so now I just

[20:59:05 - 20:59:09]
always have have to do it that way and

[20:59:07 - 20:59:10]
so I'm just searching here to see what

[20:59:09 - 20:59:13]
other kind of stuff that we have here

[20:59:10 - 20:59:15]
this one's sing to GPT 3.5 turbo which

[20:59:13 - 20:59:17]
is kind of weird because our real code

[20:59:15 - 20:59:19]
example didn't do that we should break

[20:59:17 - 20:59:21]
this up a little bit and uh make this a

[20:59:19 - 20:59:23]
little bit nicer so we'll just make a

[20:59:21 - 20:59:25]
few code blocks down here below and I'm

[20:59:23 - 20:59:27]
just going to keep dragging stuff on

[20:59:25 - 20:59:29]
down here so that'll be one part and

[20:59:27 - 20:59:32]
then we have this function here which is

[20:59:29 - 20:59:36]
clearly out of date um no one's using

[20:59:32 - 20:59:37]
GPT turbo 3.5 these days nobody

[20:59:36 - 20:59:39]
there's no reason to then we have this

[20:59:37 - 20:59:44]
function so this isn't really written

[20:59:39 - 20:59:46]
for um uh what do you call it um to be

[20:59:44 - 20:59:48]
in a jupyter notebook clearly but that's

[20:59:46 - 20:59:50]
totally fine we'll adjust it and then

[20:59:48 - 20:59:53]
we'll just see how this code

[20:59:50 - 20:59:55]
works so we go down below here we go so

[20:59:53 - 20:59:58]
this is starting to look pretty

[20:59:55 - 21:00:00]
good um I don't like how everything is

[20:59:58 - 21:00:01]
for space let's go and just change this

[21:00:00 - 21:00:03]
I know it doesn't matter but it's really

[21:00:01 - 21:00:05]
bothering

[21:00:03 - 21:00:06]
me um and so we don't need to specify

[21:00:05 - 21:00:09]
the key like this here this will just

[21:00:06 - 21:00:11]
get picked up I'm not sure about elastic

[21:00:09 - 21:00:13]
search so I'm going to leave it as is

[21:00:11 - 21:00:15]
here we can see we have uh some basic

[21:00:13 - 21:00:17]
search results I'm just going to

[21:00:15 - 21:00:19]
simplify this make our code a little bit

[21:00:17 - 21:00:21]
smaller so here says search exam Pro on

[21:00:19 - 21:00:24]
the body content that kind of makes

[21:00:21 - 21:00:25]
sense there um again just fixing all the

[21:00:24 - 21:00:28]
crazy indentation here we just have

[21:00:25 - 21:00:28]
crazy crazy

[21:00:32 - 21:00:36]
indentation okay and we'll bring this

[21:00:34 - 21:00:40]
over to the wall

[21:00:36 - 21:00:43]
[Music]

[21:00:40 - 21:00:43]
um

[21:00:43 - 21:00:48]
and we'll go

[21:00:45 - 21:00:49]
here so instructions you're an assistant

[21:00:48 - 21:00:51]
for question answering task answer

[21:00:49 - 21:00:52]
questions truthfully and factually using

[21:00:51 - 21:00:54]
only the context presented if you don't

[21:00:52 - 21:00:57]
know the answer just say you don't know

[21:00:54 - 21:00:58]
the answer use markdown format etc etc

[21:00:57 - 21:01:00]
there is some formatting issues here

[21:00:58 - 21:01:02]
that still doesn't like in inconsistent

[21:01:00 - 21:01:04]
use of tabs and spaces so that's its

[21:01:02 - 21:01:06]
problem here uh so I'll just bring this

[21:01:04 - 21:01:08]
back a level

[21:01:06 - 21:01:11]
[Music]

[21:01:08 - 21:01:12]
um and maybe bring this in a level hold

[21:01:11 - 21:01:16]
on

[21:01:12 - 21:01:19]
here does that fix it

[21:01:16 - 21:01:21]
no does that fix it

[21:01:19 - 21:01:23]
no

[21:01:21 - 21:01:25]
um I don't know we'll just keep working

[21:01:23 - 21:01:25]
with it here

[21:01:26 - 21:01:30]
so again I'm just trying to carefully

[21:01:28 - 21:01:33]
look at this code to refit it into a

[21:01:30 - 21:01:36]
jupyter notebook as it's a little bit

[21:01:33 - 21:01:37]
tricky um

[21:01:36 - 21:01:40]
because we have these three functions

[21:01:37 - 21:01:42]
right get the elastic search results

[21:01:40 - 21:01:44]
create the AI open AI prompt and then do

[21:01:42 - 21:01:46]
the completion so what I'm going to do

[21:01:44 - 21:01:47]
just going to close off a little bit of

[21:01:46 - 21:01:49]
this we're not ready to run it yet

[21:01:47 - 21:01:51]
because we don't have everything loaded

[21:01:49 - 21:01:52]
in but I want to get these three things

[21:01:51 - 21:01:54]
generally where they are so the first

[21:01:52 - 21:01:57]
one is get elastic search results which

[21:01:54 - 21:02:00]
is this right here so what I'm going to

[21:01:57 - 21:02:04]
do is I'm just going to take this

[21:02:00 - 21:02:06]
variable here and I I just going to do

[21:02:04 - 21:02:08]
this okay and then I'll take this out of

[21:02:06 - 21:02:11]
here like

[21:02:08 - 21:02:13]
this and again just trying to make this

[21:02:11 - 21:02:15]
a lot more readable so we have our query

[21:02:13 - 21:02:17]
here we have retriever standard query

[21:02:15 - 21:02:18]
multimatch query Fields we're obviously

[21:02:17 - 21:02:20]
not talking about any of those options

[21:02:18 - 21:02:22]
in here we'd have to read the

[21:02:20 - 21:02:23]
documentation to figure that out so we

[21:02:22 - 21:02:26]
have our elastic search results next

[21:02:23 - 21:02:28]
thing is to create an open AI prompt

[21:02:26 - 21:02:31]
create open AI prompt so I'm going to go

[21:02:28 - 21:02:35]
ahead here and the result here that

[21:02:31 - 21:02:35]
we're returning is actually this

[21:02:38 - 21:02:45]
okay so we set the context to be

[21:02:40 - 21:02:49]
empty then based on our results which is

[21:02:45 - 21:02:51]
here we're going to iterate through our

[21:02:49 - 21:02:54]
results

[21:02:51 - 21:02:55]
okay and it says for semantics text

[21:02:54 - 21:02:58]
matches we need to extract the text from

[21:02:55 - 21:03:00]
the inner hits okay so that's doing

[21:02:58 - 21:03:01]
obviously something but here we're

[21:03:00 - 21:03:03]
seeing in context learning so remember

[21:03:01 - 21:03:04]
we said that if you're using rag you're

[21:03:03 - 21:03:06]
pulling data and you're putting it into

[21:03:04 - 21:03:08]
the prompt that that's what it's doing

[21:03:06 - 21:03:11]
here and so I guess that's kind of like

[21:03:08 - 21:03:12]
the systems prompt yes it is I believe

[21:03:11 - 21:03:15]
it

[21:03:12 - 21:03:17]
is so here we have context prompt so I

[21:03:15 - 21:03:19]
would name this system prompt to make it

[21:03:17 - 21:03:21]
more

[21:03:19 - 21:03:25]
sense and then here we would then pass

[21:03:21 - 21:03:26]
this in as system prompt because that's

[21:03:25 - 21:03:28]
what it actually is doing here and then

[21:03:26 - 21:03:32]
we have our question so then I'll just

[21:03:28 - 21:03:32]
clear this out like this

[21:03:32 - 21:03:36]
okay now the code was fine but it was it

[21:03:35 - 21:03:39]
was intended for not like again it

[21:03:36 - 21:03:40]
wasn't intended for uh Jupiter notebooks

[21:03:39 - 21:03:43]
and so then we have our question which

[21:03:40 - 21:03:44]
is up here like this so we'll do that

[21:03:43 - 21:03:46]
we're not returning a response we're

[21:03:44 - 21:03:48]
just going to print

[21:03:46 - 21:03:49]
it so the another thing I don't know

[21:03:48 - 21:03:52]
about this code is whether it's going to

[21:03:49 - 21:03:54]
like that turbo um I suppose we can just

[21:03:52 - 21:03:59]
swap it out because the syntax looks

[21:03:54 - 21:04:02]
very very much uh easy so let say GPT 40

[21:03:59 - 21:04:03]
mini hopefully I have that set correctly

[21:04:02 - 21:04:06]
there um and then I'm just going to

[21:04:03 - 21:04:08]
delete out this block cuz it's us

[21:04:06 - 21:04:10]
okay so now we'll go back over to our

[21:04:08 - 21:04:13]
EnV and we need to populate this

[21:04:10 - 21:04:15]
information so oh you know what I

[21:04:13 - 21:04:17]
brought this one into the wrong one it's

[21:04:15 - 21:04:19]
okay so I'm going to close out this one

[21:04:17 - 21:04:21]
here we're going to copy this here and

[21:04:19 - 21:04:22]
I'll paste it in here I'll go back over

[21:04:21 - 21:04:25]
to here this is completely useless so

[21:04:22 - 21:04:28]
we'll take this out I'm going to go back

[21:04:25 - 21:04:30]
over to elastic oh I already have an API

[21:04:28 - 21:04:31]
key from earlier so we'll grab this one

[21:04:30 - 21:04:33]
that was the one we were using earlier

[21:04:31 - 21:04:36]
in this

[21:04:33 - 21:04:39]
interface and so I'm going to p paste it

[21:04:36 - 21:04:41]
into here the one thing I need is the

[21:04:39 - 21:04:44]
elastic API

[21:04:41 - 21:04:46]
key so I'm looking for that elastic API

[21:04:44 - 21:04:48]
key I'm not sure where it is we'll go

[21:04:46 - 21:04:49]
under maybe organization I kind of feel

[21:04:48 - 21:04:52]
like that's where they would put an API

[21:04:49 - 21:04:55]
key it is we'll go over to here we'll

[21:04:52 - 21:04:59]
create the new API key I call this uh

[21:04:55 - 21:05:04]
example and I really want this to like

[21:04:59 - 21:05:04]
be dead in a week and

[21:05:04 - 21:05:09]
um this API key is for elastic clouds

[21:05:07 - 21:05:11]
API only the API key created here grants

[21:05:09 - 21:05:13]
access to clouds for managing

[21:05:11 - 21:05:15]
organization deployments that is not

[21:05:13 - 21:05:17]
what we want okay that's not what we

[21:05:15 - 21:05:20]
want we

[21:05:17 - 21:05:22]
want an actual API

[21:05:20 - 21:05:25]
key I mean I think that's what we want

[21:05:22 - 21:05:25]
let's go back over here for a

[21:05:26 - 21:05:33]
second uh we'll go back over to

[21:05:29 - 21:05:36]
this for elastic search for querying

[21:05:33 - 21:05:39]
yeah it's just for querying right

[21:05:36 - 21:05:41]
so go into our deployment here also how

[21:05:39 - 21:05:42]
fast was that that was crazy every time

[21:05:41 - 21:05:44]
you use knowledge base you got to wait

[21:05:42 - 21:05:46]
forever it's crazy with Amazon bedrock

[21:05:44 - 21:05:50]
and so I'm looking

[21:05:46 - 21:05:51]
for um the AP key do you think it's this

[21:05:50 - 21:05:54]
thing

[21:05:51 - 21:05:57]
here maybe it's this

[21:05:54 - 21:05:59]
thing okay it doesn't really say but I'm

[21:05:57 - 21:06:01]
going to take a wild guess and I'm going

[21:05:59 - 21:06:03]
to assume that is the key and so we have

[21:06:01 - 21:06:05]
these three values set so hopefully that

[21:06:03 - 21:06:06]
is good we'll go back over to here we

[21:06:05 - 21:06:08]
already ran this I'm going to run it

[21:06:06 - 21:06:10]
again I don't care I'll run it 10 times

[21:06:08 - 21:06:14]
if I want to and then we will run this

[21:06:10 - 21:06:18]
we'll load our envs and so now we will

[21:06:14 - 21:06:21]
uh run this and then we will run

[21:06:18 - 21:06:23]
this and we have a problem query is not

[21:06:21 - 21:06:27]
defined yes fair enough it doesn't know

[21:06:23 - 21:06:29]
what query is so in this context what is

[21:06:27 - 21:06:32]
query is query the

[21:06:29 - 21:06:33]
question because that seems like what it

[21:06:32 - 21:06:37]
would be

[21:06:33 - 21:06:40]
right so let's go back over to our

[21:06:37 - 21:06:44]
example and if we go down

[21:06:40 - 21:06:47]
here we have question here if we go up

[21:06:44 - 21:06:47]
to here there is no

[21:06:48 - 21:06:52]
query so where's this coming

[21:06:53 - 21:06:58]
from so it looks like their codes

[21:06:55 - 21:07:00]
incomplete because it seems to me that

[21:06:58 - 21:07:02]
if we had a query that's where it would

[21:07:00 - 21:07:03]
be but it says multi match query I would

[21:07:02 - 21:07:06]
think that that would be the same

[21:07:03 - 21:07:10]
question

[21:07:06 - 21:07:12]
so H one second sorry I'm back I wanted

[21:07:10 - 21:07:14]
to go tell someone elastic that their

[21:07:12 - 21:07:16]
code example was out of date again

[21:07:14 - 21:07:18]
platform really good so far but um that

[21:07:16 - 21:07:20]
one example is out of date because

[21:07:18 - 21:07:20]
obviously the query is not being set so

[21:07:20 - 21:07:24]
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

[21:07:20 - 21:07:26]
pull this up here and I'm assuming that

[21:07:24 - 21:07:28]
the query is the question that's what

[21:07:26 - 21:07:29]
I'm assuming that it is so I'll go up

[21:07:28 - 21:07:31]
here and I'm just going to change this

[21:07:29 - 21:07:34]
over to query and then I'm also going to

[21:07:31 - 21:07:36]
go down here um to here and paste it in

[21:07:34 - 21:07:39]
here as well the other thing is that um

[21:07:36 - 21:07:40]
we asked a very specific question oh

[21:07:39 - 21:07:42]
yeah la exam Pro who's your favorite

[21:07:40 - 21:07:43]
instructor so I'm going to go ahead and

[21:07:42 - 21:07:46]
grab this

[21:07:43 - 21:07:48]
here and we'll go back over to here and

[21:07:46 - 21:07:51]
I'm going to scroll on

[21:07:48 - 21:07:52]
up and you find this a lot with these uh

[21:07:51 - 21:07:54]
products is that their stuff's always

[21:07:52 - 21:07:56]
out of date um so we're going to go go

[21:07:54 - 21:07:57]
ahead and do this and so again I'm just

[21:07:56 - 21:07:59]
taking a guess of what this is supposed

[21:07:57 - 21:08:01]
to be it seems like we still have a

[21:07:59 - 21:08:04]
problem unable to authenticate the

[21:08:01 - 21:08:06]
provider credentials uh uh an anonymous

[21:08:04 - 21:08:08]
access is not allowed so clearly the key

[21:08:06 - 21:08:10]
that we're utilizing here is not correct

[21:08:08 - 21:08:13]
um so we need to figure out where that

[21:08:10 - 21:08:15]
open API key is so I'm going to go over

[21:08:13 - 21:08:17]
to here um and so I'm just trying to

[21:08:15 - 21:08:19]
think like where is the key that we need

[21:08:17 - 21:08:22]
to utilize um so we are in the

[21:08:19 - 21:08:24]
playground right now just scrolling up

[21:08:22 - 21:08:27]
let's go to Dev tools maybe nope that's

[21:08:24 - 21:08:30]
not it you think of the playground it

[21:08:27 - 21:08:33]
would show it somewhere here nope

[21:08:30 - 21:08:35]
overview Cloud ID so have active API

[21:08:33 - 21:08:38]
Keys there's zero that are activated we

[21:08:35 - 21:08:40]
go ahead and hit new

[21:08:38 - 21:08:42]
and oh yeah so it's Crea an API key so

[21:08:40 - 21:08:46]
we'll just say

[21:08:42 - 21:08:50]
example and I want this expire in one

[21:08:46 - 21:08:51]
day can I can I go down here there we go

[21:08:50 - 21:08:54]
we'll set it for one day I'll give it

[21:08:51 - 21:08:57]
two days just in case um security

[21:08:54 - 21:09:00]
[Music]

[21:08:57 - 21:09:03]
privileges uh metadata I don't know if I

[21:09:00 - 21:09:06]
need any of those we'll create the API

[21:09:03 - 21:09:07]
key and so now

[21:09:06 - 21:09:09]
we only see this once so save it

[21:09:07 - 21:09:11]
somewhere else don't store it don't

[21:09:09 - 21:09:13]
store your API Keys we don't store your

[21:09:11 - 21:09:15]
API Keys fair enough okay so which is

[21:09:13 - 21:09:17]
the API key I'm not sure so I'm going to

[21:09:15 - 21:09:19]
go ahead and copy this this thing is a

[21:09:17 - 21:09:22]
little bit confusing I'm going to be

[21:09:19 - 21:09:24]
honest with you here but that's okay I

[21:09:22 - 21:09:26]
can uh I can work with this and so I'm

[21:09:24 - 21:09:27]
going to go back over to here and I'm

[21:09:26 - 21:09:32]
going to go into

[21:09:27 - 21:09:35]
myv and I'm just going to drag this on

[21:09:32 - 21:09:36]
over and so I'm assuming that this is is

[21:09:35 - 21:09:38]
the API key now I don't know why we get

[21:09:36 - 21:09:42]
all this other stuff here that's

[21:09:38 - 21:09:44]
fine don't understand it but we'll go

[21:09:42 - 21:09:46]
ahead and we will paste this into here

[21:09:44 - 21:09:48]
I'm going to go and save this we'll go

[21:09:46 - 21:09:50]
back over to here and so now we

[21:09:48 - 21:09:51]
supposedly should have our key I'm going

[21:09:50 - 21:09:53]
to just restart this just because we've

[21:09:51 - 21:09:54]
made so many changes at this point I'm

[21:09:53 - 21:09:56]
going to restart this completely I'm

[21:09:54 - 21:09:58]
going to work our way

[21:09:56 - 21:10:01]
down okay we're going to reload all this

[21:09:58 - 21:10:03]
stuff so now it should be loaded in and

[21:10:01 - 21:10:05]
assuming the names are correct I believe

[21:10:03 - 21:10:07]
all the names are correct and we should

[21:10:05 - 21:10:10]
now be able to do a

[21:10:07 - 21:10:12]
query okay so it says es client is not

[21:10:10 - 21:10:16]
defined this code this code they gave me

[21:10:12 - 21:10:17]
is so not complete but we have elastic

[21:10:16 - 21:10:19]
search

[21:10:17 - 21:10:24]
here

[21:10:19 - 21:10:26]
mhm so let's go back over to here and

[21:10:24 - 21:10:28]
we'll go back to the playground and we

[21:10:26 - 21:10:30]
still have our previous example I like

[21:10:28 - 21:10:33]
that the previous example is still here

[21:10:30 - 21:10:36]
so here is es client up here oh yeah we

[21:10:33 - 21:10:40]
did Define that well where the heck is

[21:10:36 - 21:10:42]
it I remember defining that right here

[21:10:40 - 21:10:44]
oh right here did we not run that line

[21:10:42 - 21:10:48]
yes client

[21:10:44 - 21:10:48]
yes unless it doesn't

[21:10:49 - 21:10:54]
work okay so here it

[21:10:52 - 21:10:56]
says um

[21:10:54 - 21:10:57]
authentication unable to authenticate

[21:10:56 - 21:10:58]
with the provided credentials and

[21:10:57 - 21:11:00]
Anonymous a is not allowed for this

[21:10:58 - 21:11:02]
request so it could be that there's

[21:11:00 - 21:11:03]
something with this API key that we have

[21:11:02 - 21:11:06]
to

[21:11:03 - 21:11:08]
set so we'll go over to manage AP I Keys

[21:11:06 - 21:11:11]
here that's like another spot okay so

[21:11:08 - 21:11:14]
this is where we really wanted to be wow

[21:11:11 - 21:11:15]
do I have a lot of keys who knew I had

[21:11:14 - 21:11:19]
this many keys so this is the example

[21:11:15 - 21:11:21]
that I have here control security

[21:11:19 - 21:11:23]
privileges

[21:11:21 - 21:11:26]
um I mean we don't need to write we just

[21:11:23 - 21:11:28]
need readon access so let's just do that

[21:11:26 - 21:11:29]
let's go to metadata I don't need any

[21:11:28 - 21:11:31]
metadata so we'll updated so maybe we

[21:11:29 - 21:11:33]
just needed some permissions to work

[21:11:31 - 21:11:34]
with it and so we'll go back over to

[21:11:33 - 21:11:36]
here I'm not sure if this stuff

[21:11:34 - 21:11:37]
propagates instantaneously but we'll try

[21:11:36 - 21:11:41]
it

[21:11:37 - 21:11:43]
again and unable to

[21:11:41 - 21:11:44]
authenticate provide a credentials an

[21:11:43 - 21:11:46]
ominous axis is not allowed well I

[21:11:44 - 21:11:49]
definitely have the correct key now for

[21:11:46 - 21:11:52]
sure so we'll go back over to

[21:11:49 - 21:11:52]
here

[21:11:53 - 21:11:59]
and we'll click into this

[21:11:55 - 21:11:59]
again we gave it

[21:11:59 - 21:12:04]
permissions but we updated the key right

[21:12:03 - 21:12:06]
all I can think of is that it doesn't

[21:12:04 - 21:12:08]
propagate instantaneously because again

[21:12:06 - 21:12:10]
I I'm not certain how long it takes I'm

[21:12:08 - 21:12:13]
going to go give this another restart

[21:12:10 - 21:12:14]
and we'll try this one more time if it

[21:12:13 - 21:12:16]
doesn't work we'll just read the code

[21:12:14 - 21:12:18]
and we'll just be like okay cool but

[21:12:16 - 21:12:19]
we're not going to fiddle around with

[21:12:18 - 21:12:20]
all day every day because if it's not

[21:12:19 - 21:12:24]
easy to use and that's their problem

[21:12:20 - 21:12:27]
right and so we'll go ahead and run

[21:12:24 - 21:12:27]
this so

[21:12:27 - 21:12:33]
401 okay so

[21:12:30 - 21:12:35]
let's I'll spend a little bit extra time

[21:12:33 - 21:12:38]
with this elastic and we'll go ahead and

[21:12:35 - 21:12:38]
do

[21:12:41 - 21:12:45]
this and see if we can figure it out

[21:12:43 - 21:12:47]
I'll be back in a moment if I find a

[21:12:45 - 21:12:49]
solution okay so here it's saying the

[21:12:47 - 21:12:50]
docs you referenced are to create the

[21:12:49 - 21:12:53]
elastic search service API key to

[21:12:50 - 21:12:55]
operate an elastic search deployment API

[21:12:53 - 21:12:56]
Keys allow you to create update delete

[21:12:55 - 21:12:58]
deployments not necessarily work with

[21:12:56 - 21:13:00]
data for operations you're trying to do

[21:12:58 - 21:13:03]
the elastic search normal rest API you

[21:13:00 - 21:13:06]
need to create a normal API

[21:13:03 - 21:13:09]
key uhuh well I'm not sure but um we

[21:13:06 - 21:13:11]
created a key here let's go over to

[21:13:09 - 21:13:13]
manage so what kind of key is this allow

[21:13:11 - 21:13:16]
external services to access elastic

[21:13:13 - 21:13:18]
stack on behalf of the user okay but

[21:13:16 - 21:13:20]
what kind of key is this I don't know

[21:13:18 - 21:13:26]
but when we go into

[21:13:20 - 21:13:27]
here it says name all privileges read

[21:13:26 - 21:13:29]
and so there's no restrictions here so

[21:13:27 - 21:13:31]
to me this has to be the right kind of

[21:13:29 - 21:13:34]
key that we're supposed to

[21:13:31 - 21:13:36]
utilize okay so there's

[21:13:34 - 21:13:37]
something something that's missing here

[21:13:36 - 21:13:38]
that I'm not aware of but I I can't

[21:13:37 - 21:13:40]
figure it out so we're not going to

[21:13:38 - 21:13:42]
fiddle around with it too long but I

[21:13:40 - 21:13:44]
would say that if if we could get past

[21:13:42 - 21:13:46]
this authentication thing I think

[21:13:44 - 21:13:48]
elastic search this thing looks really

[21:13:46 - 21:13:50]
cool like it gives us a complete example

[21:13:48 - 21:13:51]
here I'm going to play around with a

[21:13:50 - 21:13:53]
little bit more I just want to see if I

[21:13:51 - 21:13:55]
can get to work all right so here

[21:13:53 - 21:13:56]
they're suggesting that when you connect

[21:13:55 - 21:13:59]
with API there's two parts to it this

[21:13:56 - 21:14:02]
worked for me the API key is apparently

[21:13:59 - 21:14:04]
API key ID and then API key so maybe

[21:14:02 - 21:14:07]
this is our problem now that's not what

[21:14:04 - 21:14:09]
it showed us but maybe that will fix our

[21:14:07 - 21:14:11]
issue um but if we can figure it out

[21:14:09 - 21:14:13]
that's totally cool so I'm going to go

[21:14:11 - 21:14:17]
here and I'm going to just paste this as

[21:14:13 - 21:14:18]
such uh like that and so I'm going to

[21:14:17 - 21:14:20]
bring this on well we don't really need

[21:14:18 - 21:14:23]
to do that do we so this is going to be

[21:14:20 - 21:14:25]
API es API

[21:14:23 - 21:14:28]
key I mean that wouldn't match their

[21:14:25 - 21:14:28]
docs though

[21:14:29 - 21:14:35]
right so ESP API key ID

[21:14:35 - 21:14:39]
and so now I have this variant here so

[21:14:38 - 21:14:42]
maybe this will fix her

[21:14:39 - 21:14:45]
problem so supposedly this one is fine I

[21:14:42 - 21:14:48]
hope I kept that open somewhere

[21:14:45 - 21:14:50]
still did I no I did not so I'm going to

[21:14:48 - 21:14:52]
go ahead and delete this we are going to

[21:14:50 - 21:14:55]
create a new API key this will be

[21:14:52 - 21:14:57]
example two

[21:14:55 - 21:15:00]
and example

[21:14:57 - 21:15:03]
two and we will give it full readon

[21:15:00 - 21:15:05]
access oops let's actually go back here

[21:15:03 - 21:15:08]
let's create this again according from

[21:15:05 - 21:15:11]
this interface I'm noticing that we

[21:15:08 - 21:15:12]
have all clusters all indenes everywhere

[21:15:11 - 21:15:13]
this gives us full full access

[21:15:12 - 21:15:15]
everywhere so that sounds good to me I'm

[21:15:13 - 21:15:17]
going ignore the expiry date here I'm

[21:15:15 - 21:15:20]
just going to manually delete that out

[21:15:17 - 21:15:22]
so I've created it but where's the key

[21:15:20 - 21:15:24]
information now copy this key you'll not

[21:15:22 - 21:15:25]
be able to view it again oh well this

[21:15:24 - 21:15:29]
one only has

[21:15:25 - 21:15:31]
the okay but this key looks

[21:15:29 - 21:15:33]
different what is going

[21:15:31 - 21:15:35]
on the UI is a little bit uh

[21:15:33 - 21:15:40]
inconsistent here so hold on here hold

[21:15:35 - 21:15:42]
on here that's way longer oh my goodness

[21:15:40 - 21:15:45]
okay so let's go back to here maybe all

[21:15:42 - 21:15:47]
we do need is one and then the interface

[21:15:45 - 21:15:49]
is just confusing so let's go ahead and

[21:15:47 - 21:15:53]
take a look

[21:15:49 - 21:15:56]
here and we will do this and I guess

[21:15:53 - 21:15:58]
I'll just restart this again I'm going

[21:15:56 - 21:16:00]
to make sure that I saved that file

[21:15:58 - 21:16:03]
where is it here yeah here it

[21:16:00 - 21:16:05]
is and we'll go ahead and we'll run this

[21:16:03 - 21:16:07]
and then we'll run this one

[21:16:05 - 21:16:10]
and then we'll run this one and now

[21:16:07 - 21:16:12]
we'll run this one run this one please

[21:16:10 - 21:16:15]
work please please

[21:16:12 - 21:16:16]
work okay there we go so it's really

[21:16:15 - 21:16:18]
weird it seems like there's more than

[21:16:16 - 21:16:21]
one way to make a key and then the

[21:16:18 - 21:16:23]
output of the key is different so that

[21:16:21 - 21:16:25]
kind of strange but anyway we figured it

[21:16:23 - 21:16:27]
out that's totally fine let's go ahead

[21:16:25 - 21:16:30]
and continue on

[21:16:27 - 21:16:32]
here and we'll go ahead and run

[21:16:30 - 21:16:35]
this I don't

[21:16:32 - 21:16:36]
know okay well

[21:16:35 - 21:16:38]
well I mean it must have the information

[21:16:36 - 21:16:39]
right so here we have the results I'm

[21:16:38 - 21:16:41]
curious what it's getting back as

[21:16:39 - 21:16:44]
results

[21:16:41 - 21:16:47]
um so here for semantic search text

[21:16:44 - 21:16:50]
let's go print out I'm going to separate

[21:16:47 - 21:16:52]
this out into two steps

[21:16:50 - 21:16:54]
here and we'll say

[21:16:52 - 21:16:57]
print

[21:16:54 - 21:17:01]
context okay we'll hit print

[21:16:57 - 21:17:03]
here so we are getting that stuff back

[21:17:01 - 21:17:05]
so it is grabbing

[21:17:03 - 21:17:08]
stuff but maybe the issue is like the

[21:17:05 - 21:17:10]
query itself is not optimal so this is

[21:17:08 - 21:17:14]
the question that we ask but what is the

[21:17:10 - 21:17:14]
query so maybe these things should be

[21:17:14 - 21:17:18]
separate okay so we have

[21:17:18 - 21:17:23]
question here and then we have query so

[21:17:22 - 21:17:26]
this will be uh

[21:17:23 - 21:17:29]
[Music]

[21:17:26 - 21:17:31]
favorite instructor so now what we're

[21:17:29 - 21:17:32]
kind of doing is we're we're we're

[21:17:31 - 21:17:36]
selectively just choosing this text's

[21:17:32 - 21:17:36]
favorite instructor

[21:17:39 - 21:17:43]
did I spell that right I think I did and

[21:17:41 - 21:17:45]
so I'll go down here and I'm going to

[21:17:43 - 21:17:47]
update this now to

[21:17:45 - 21:17:49]
question one thing I'm kind of curious

[21:17:47 - 21:17:51]
is if we go over to the playground

[21:17:49 - 21:17:53]
notice there it says on exampro doco who

[21:17:51 - 21:17:55]
is our favorite instructor AI searching

[21:17:53 - 21:17:58]
for who is the favorite instructor on

[21:17:55 - 21:18:00]
exam pro. also the question is what

[21:17:58 - 21:18:01]
spelling does it use um I'm Canadian so

[21:18:00 - 21:18:03]
this is the Canadian spelling but the

[21:18:01 - 21:18:05]
question is is that do we use the

[21:18:03 - 21:18:06]
Canadian or the American spelling sping

[21:18:05 - 21:18:08]
here we're using the American spelling

[21:18:06 - 21:18:09]
on the website so that could confuse it

[21:18:08 - 21:18:11]
as

[21:18:09 - 21:18:12]
well and it's returning back three

[21:18:11 - 21:18:16]
documents

[21:18:12 - 21:18:19]
here but can we see the query input so I

[21:18:16 - 21:18:19]
want to type in query here

[21:18:20 - 21:18:24]
query because this interface doesn't

[21:18:22 - 21:18:26]
necessarily show it but I'm assuming

[21:18:24 - 21:18:29]
that this

[21:18:26 - 21:18:30]
is because it clearly is reworded it a

[21:18:29 - 21:18:33]
little

[21:18:30 - 21:18:34]
bit but I can't again I can't see what

[21:18:33 - 21:18:37]
the underlying one is so I'm going to go

[21:18:34 - 21:18:39]
back over here um to this

[21:18:37 - 21:18:41]
one

[21:18:39 - 21:18:43]
and I mean we'll use it with the

[21:18:41 - 21:18:44]
incorrect spelling first no I'm going to

[21:18:43 - 21:18:46]
take it out I'm G to make it the

[21:18:44 - 21:18:48]
American spelling

[21:18:46 - 21:18:49]
favor favorite how do you spell it

[21:18:48 - 21:18:50]
American

[21:18:49 - 21:18:52]
style

[21:18:50 - 21:18:56]
faor

[21:18:52 - 21:18:58]
wrote favorote I can't I can't spell it

[21:18:56 - 21:19:00]
the American way I just can't I can't

[21:18:58 - 21:19:02]
perceive it without that value that's

[21:19:00 - 21:19:05]
really hard for me let's go back to

[21:19:02 - 21:19:05]
exampro doco

[21:19:06 - 21:19:13]
favorite favorite favorite favorite

[21:19:09 - 21:19:16]
favorite okay again I'm dyslexic so this

[21:19:13 - 21:19:20]
stuff is very challenging for me and

[21:19:16 - 21:19:22]
so we'll take out the this one here and

[21:19:20 - 21:19:27]
then this one

[21:19:22 - 21:19:31]
here that doesn't look right to me favor

[21:19:27 - 21:19:34]
wrote favor right okay there we go yeah

[21:19:31 - 21:19:36]
I again Tru TR truthfully very dyslexic

[21:19:34 - 21:19:39]
we go ahead and paste it in here we'll

[21:19:36 - 21:19:41]
go ahead and paste it in here so now we

[21:19:39 - 21:19:42]
have that I'm going to go ahead I don't

[21:19:41 - 21:19:44]
probably how many times I've restarted

[21:19:42 - 21:19:47]
this we'll restarted again and so maybe

[21:19:44 - 21:19:47]
this time we'll get the result that we

[21:19:54 - 21:20:00]
wanted

[21:19:56 - 21:20:02]
okay so now we're starting to

[21:20:00 - 21:20:04]
get different text in here I'm not sure

[21:20:02 - 21:20:08]
if it's the text that we want

[21:20:04 - 21:20:08]
but we'll go ahead and we'll run

[21:20:08 - 21:20:13]
this there we go and so now we're

[21:20:11 - 21:20:14]
getting the result that we want so

[21:20:13 - 21:20:16]
that's the integration with elastic

[21:20:14 - 21:20:19]
search uh again the UI really good the

[21:20:16 - 21:20:20]
getting the key what a pain in the butt

[21:20:19 - 21:20:22]
looks like we have other connectors here

[21:20:20 - 21:20:23]
which might be interesting so if there's

[21:20:22 - 21:20:26]
other data sources that we want to plug

[21:20:23 - 21:20:30]
into uh they are clearly here and that

[21:20:26 - 21:20:33]
could be uh easy to do but uh yeah I'm

[21:20:30 - 21:20:36]
not sure cost wise how good this is so

[21:20:33 - 21:20:39]
if we go look at like clastic search

[21:20:36 - 21:20:41]
pricing I'd imagine it's on par with

[21:20:39 - 21:20:44]
dats we'll go over to here for a

[21:20:41 - 21:20:47]
second what's the pricing for this

[21:20:44 - 21:20:50]
thing $95 a month for standard so that

[21:20:47 - 21:20:52]
sounds about right um I'm pretty certain

[21:20:50 - 21:20:54]
that elastic search cluster on ads is

[21:20:52 - 21:20:56]
going to cost way more than that so this

[21:20:54 - 21:20:57]
I think is still more cost effective

[21:20:56 - 21:20:59]
let's go take a look here say ads

[21:20:57 - 21:21:02]
elastic search

[21:20:59 - 21:21:04]
pricing there's with the equivalent is

[21:21:02 - 21:21:07]
open search um but I think think there's

[21:21:04 - 21:21:08]
deployments onto adabs as well let's go

[21:21:07 - 21:21:11]
take a look at what the cost of open

[21:21:08 - 21:21:14]
search is you obviously do get a free

[21:21:11 - 21:21:15]
tier but we will scroll on down here and

[21:21:14 - 21:21:18]
just take a look here may maybe it US

[21:21:15 - 21:21:20]
Open search is cheaper I don't

[21:21:18 - 21:21:22]
know we'll give this just a moment here

[21:21:20 - 21:21:23]
and so with the smallest we have this

[21:21:22 - 21:21:29]
per

[21:21:23 - 21:21:30]
hour times 720 $25 a month I don't think

[21:21:29 - 21:21:33]
that's right because I know that when

[21:21:30 - 21:21:35]
you run uh knowledge base it costs more

[21:21:33 - 21:21:39]
and I don't think you can control what

[21:21:35 - 21:21:40]
size it is so we'll say like ads or like

[21:21:39 - 21:21:42]
Amazon knowledge

[21:21:40 - 21:21:44]
base pricing cuz that's what we're

[21:21:42 - 21:21:46]
really comparing it against we're not

[21:21:44 - 21:21:48]
comparing it against running our own

[21:21:46 - 21:21:50]
open search service which we maybe like

[21:21:48 - 21:21:52]
if we want to do that uh indirectly

[21:21:50 - 21:21:53]
maybe we could do that but this is what

[21:21:52 - 21:21:54]
I really want to know is what the cost

[21:21:53 - 21:21:57]
of this

[21:21:54 - 21:21:59]
is um so this is Amazon bedrock and I'm

[21:21:57 - 21:22:01]
looking specifically for the knowledge

[21:21:59 - 21:22:03]
base

[21:22:01 - 21:22:06]
pricing um knowledge base knowledge base

[21:22:03 - 21:22:06]
knowledge base

[21:22:06 - 21:22:10]
[Music]

[21:22:09 - 21:22:13]
that's the structur query but what about

[21:22:10 - 21:22:13]
just running

[21:22:13 - 21:22:19]
it unless they changed it but I'm pretty

[21:22:17 - 21:22:22]
certain just by running it it it costs

[21:22:19 - 21:22:22]
quite a bit of

[21:22:22 - 21:22:28]
money $2 per 10,000

[21:22:25 - 21:22:32]
queries did they change their pricing

[21:22:28 - 21:22:37]
model knowledge base pricing model

[21:22:32 - 21:22:37]
Amazon cuz they might have changed it

[21:22:38 - 21:22:43]
right yeah like see this they're talking

[21:22:41 - 21:22:44]
about like how expensive it gets it us

[21:22:43 - 21:22:46]
Bedrock knowledge based minimum cost

[21:22:44 - 21:22:47]
beware and so they're talking about what

[21:22:46 - 21:22:50]
it runs

[21:22:47 - 21:22:53]
underneath and this comes out to $720

[21:22:50 - 21:22:55]
per month or $360 and so that's why I

[21:22:53 - 21:22:56]
keep thinking it's very expensive but I

[21:22:55 - 21:22:59]
couldn't figure it out based on that

[21:22:56 - 21:23:02]
pricing page but anyway uh alasa

[21:22:59 - 21:23:04]
search it's really good um I've always

[21:23:02 - 21:23:06]
heard really good things about it uh so

[21:23:04 - 21:23:08]
so other than the the API key being a

[21:23:06 - 21:23:09]
little bit confusing there we did get a

[21:23:08 - 21:23:10]
working example we're going to wrap this

[21:23:09 - 21:23:12]
one up we're going to make sure we

[21:23:10 - 21:23:14]
didn't commit anything here and we'll

[21:23:12 - 21:23:16]
say that this is done with elastic

[21:23:14 - 21:23:19]
search and so that was great and we will

[21:23:16 - 21:23:22]
see you in the next one

[21:23:19 - 21:23:24]
[Music]

[21:23:22 - 21:23:25]
ciao hey this is Andrew Brown in this

[21:23:24 - 21:23:29]
video we're going to take a look at

[21:23:25 - 21:23:31]
utilizing mongodb as our um our our

[21:23:29 - 21:23:33]
place where we can store our data let's

[21:23:31 - 21:23:34]
go ahead and and sign in or make an

[21:23:33 - 21:23:38]
account for free I already have an

[21:23:34 - 21:23:40]
account um and mongodb is really good uh

[21:23:38 - 21:23:43]
I'm not in here every single day but I

[21:23:40 - 21:23:45]
do know my way around mongodb I know

[21:23:43 - 21:23:47]
there's a good example out here to work

[21:23:45 - 21:23:49]
with uh cooh here link Google account by

[21:23:47 - 21:23:51]
linking your account we can switch to

[21:23:49 - 21:23:52]
your authentication method uh sure L

[21:23:51 - 21:23:54]
we'll link our account here oh I do not

[21:23:52 - 21:23:55]
want to have to put a password in just

[21:23:54 - 21:23:57]
let me in here today so I'm going to go

[21:23:55 - 21:23:59]
ahead and give this another go I think

[21:23:57 - 21:24:01]
it's because I have a manual account so

[21:23:59 - 21:24:02]
I'm going to return to login and I'm

[21:24:01 - 21:24:05]
just going to log in manually just give

[21:24:02 - 21:24:06]
me one moment here there we go we're in

[21:24:05 - 21:24:08]
I'm going to remind myself later I do

[21:24:06 - 21:24:11]
not want to do that right now and so now

[21:24:08 - 21:24:12]
I'm in mongodb I probably already have a

[21:24:11 - 21:24:14]
cluster set up here actually looks like

[21:24:12 - 21:24:17]
it's deleted and so I want to start

[21:24:14 - 21:24:19]
working with uh this and so um let's go

[21:24:17 - 21:24:20]
ahead I know coh here has an example so

[21:24:19 - 21:24:24]
say cooh here

[21:24:20 - 21:24:27]
mongodb as uh a rag example so that

[21:24:24 - 21:24:29]
might be one we want to take a look at

[21:24:27 - 21:24:31]
as a way to do

[21:24:29 - 21:24:34]
Integrations um so mongodb in Co here

[21:24:31 - 21:24:36]
mongodb atas search as a fully managed

[21:24:34 - 21:24:38]
thing let's take a look at this guide

[21:24:36 - 21:24:38]
how to use

[21:24:38 - 21:24:43]
embeddings I know I've done one of them

[21:24:41 - 21:24:45]
around here I'm just trying to find it

[21:24:43 - 21:24:48]
here so is this the one that I

[21:24:45 - 21:24:48]
utilized

[21:24:49 - 21:24:54]
before I'm not certain I think I'd

[21:24:52 - 21:24:56]
rather go to the mongodb website and

[21:24:54 - 21:24:59]
we'll take a look at rag this way and

[21:24:56 - 21:25:01]
we'll find an example that way there

[21:24:59 - 21:25:02]
because I know that they I think it

[21:25:01 - 21:25:04]
might have been this way like if I went

[21:25:02 - 21:25:06]
to Vector search and I found example

[21:25:04 - 21:25:08]
there that was the one that worked a lot

[21:25:06 - 21:25:11]
better for me so again just looking for

[21:25:08 - 21:25:13]
it just give me a second to find it okay

[21:25:11 - 21:25:15]
all right so I got a got to the docs

[21:25:13 - 21:25:17]
here with Atlas Vector search Rag and

[21:25:15 - 21:25:19]
under here we have ai Integrations and

[21:25:17 - 21:25:24]
so I'm

[21:25:19 - 21:25:27]
looking for a particular integration

[21:25:24 - 21:25:30]
here I remember having a tutorial using

[21:25:27 - 21:25:31]
it with um mongodb give me a second I

[21:25:30 - 21:25:35]
probably have it on my email here I

[21:25:31 - 21:25:38]
found it it's over here in um coher AI

[21:25:35 - 21:25:40]
um coher AI guides and so this is one I

[21:25:38 - 21:25:43]
think that we could go ahead and utilize

[21:25:40 - 21:25:45]
they do have a collab so maybe we should

[21:25:43 - 21:25:47]
just open this up in collab I feel like

[21:25:45 - 21:25:48]
we haven't done enough in collab and so

[21:25:47 - 21:25:51]
since there's a button there let's press

[21:25:48 - 21:25:52]
it and launch it up here um and so this

[21:25:51 - 21:25:56]
is Integrations between coh here and

[21:25:52 - 21:25:57]
mongodb so um yeah we'll just scroll on

[21:25:56 - 21:26:00]
down a little bit here and see what we

[21:25:57 - 21:26:02]
have so they're just kind of explaining

[21:26:00 - 21:26:03]
how it all works I want to go through

[21:26:02 - 21:26:05]
the steps and get this installed so here

[21:26:03 - 21:26:08]
we in data set so that's obviously

[21:26:05 - 21:26:09]
hugging face tqdm we see that a lot is

[21:26:08 - 21:26:12]
that just for

[21:26:09 - 21:26:13]
Progress a fast extensible progress bar

[21:26:12 - 21:26:15]
it is it's just the progress

[21:26:13 - 21:26:18]
bar and then we're bringing Co here

[21:26:15 - 21:26:20]
we're bringing Pi so we'll go

[21:26:18 - 21:26:23]
ahead and say

[21:26:20 - 21:26:26]
run at this point you should have collab

[21:26:23 - 21:26:26]
so this should be a non-issue for

[21:26:27 - 21:26:31]
you and we'll give that a moment to run

[21:26:29 - 21:26:33]
here all right so let's take a look here

[21:26:31 - 21:26:34]
it says pip dependency resolver does not

[21:26:33 - 21:26:36]
currently take in account okay it's that

[21:26:34 - 21:26:38]
generic error that says there could be

[21:26:36 - 21:26:41]
issues but I don't believe there's an

[21:26:38 - 21:26:43]
issue um yeah so I don't think there's

[21:26:41 - 21:26:45]
an issue here then here we need to put

[21:26:43 - 21:26:48]
in our coh here API key so I'm going to

[21:26:45 - 21:26:50]
go over to coh here and we'll go ahead

[21:26:48 - 21:26:54]
and get an API

[21:26:50 - 21:26:55]
key and we'll sign in here I wonder if

[21:26:54 - 21:26:58]
um now that I'm getting really good at

[21:26:55 - 21:27:00]
loading up my um uh environment

[21:26:58 - 21:27:02]
variables I wonder if there's a way to

[21:27:00 - 21:27:05]
do that here so we're not directly

[21:27:02 - 21:27:06]
exposing um R key I'm not really sure if

[21:27:05 - 21:27:09]
there actually is a way that we can do

[21:27:06 - 21:27:09]
that this one's going to be

[21:27:10 - 21:27:16]
mongodb okay we'll copy

[21:27:14 - 21:27:18]
that

[21:27:16 - 21:27:19]
and I mean there there's a file system

[21:27:18 - 21:27:24]
right

[21:27:19 - 21:27:27]
here so in theory we could make aemv

[21:27:24 - 21:27:30]
file um but where is this

[21:27:27 - 21:27:33]
file uhoh now I don't know where I

[21:27:30 - 21:27:34]
am hate when that happen so I'm just

[21:27:33 - 21:27:37]
going to recollapse that really don't

[21:27:34 - 21:27:38]
know where I am so I'm just going to uh

[21:27:37 - 21:27:40]
do it the lame way I'm just going to

[21:27:38 - 21:27:42]
paste it in here like this it looks like

[21:27:40 - 21:27:45]
it also wants hugging face token I'm not

[21:27:42 - 21:27:46]
sure why oh maybe for the data sets so

[21:27:45 - 21:27:48]
we're going to make our way over to

[21:27:46 - 21:27:51]
hugging face I

[21:27:48 - 21:27:52]
guess get really good at grabbing Keys

[21:27:51 - 21:27:54]
everywhere and we're going to go down

[21:27:52 - 21:27:56]
over to access tokens and I got to sign

[21:27:54 - 21:27:59]
in so just give me a moment

[21:27:56 - 21:28:00]
here okay and so I have an older key

[21:27:59 - 21:28:02]
here I'm going to go ahead and delete it

[21:28:00 - 21:28:03]
I'm always making new keys every two

[21:28:02 - 21:28:05]
seconds I'm making keys we'll go ahead

[21:28:03 - 21:28:07]
and make a new key here this will be

[21:28:05 - 21:28:10]
read only and just be

[21:28:07 - 21:28:10]
for

[21:28:10 - 21:28:14]
mongodb I'm not sure what it wants to

[21:28:12 - 21:28:16]
pull at this point in time but we'll go

[21:28:14 - 21:28:19]
ahead and find out in just a moment and

[21:28:16 - 21:28:19]
so we'll paste in that

[21:28:23 - 21:28:31]
key and we'll go ahead and we will run

[21:28:28 - 21:28:32]
this okay and so we're getting the coh

[21:28:31 - 21:28:34]
API key I do not like setting it here

[21:28:32 - 21:28:35]
like this but I don't don't see how else

[21:28:34 - 21:28:38]
we're going to set it in this

[21:28:35 - 21:28:40]
environment um I mean we're not sharing

[21:28:38 - 21:28:42]
this with anybody so it should be a

[21:28:40 - 21:28:43]
non-issue u but I don't really like

[21:28:42 - 21:28:45]
leaving my keys around here of course

[21:28:43 - 21:28:46]
you can just delete your keys afterwards

[21:28:45 - 21:28:48]
so the data set contains detailed

[21:28:46 - 21:28:50]
information about multiple technology

[21:28:48 - 21:28:53]
companies in the information technology

[21:28:50 - 21:28:54]
sector okay that sounds fine the market

[21:28:53 - 21:28:56]
analysis reports provides in-depth

[21:28:54 - 21:28:58]
information about each company's

[21:28:56 - 21:29:00]
performance so here we have the data set

[21:28:58 - 21:29:02]
we're loading the data set here uh and

[21:29:00 - 21:29:04]
then we are putting it into a data frame

[21:29:02 - 21:29:07]
I suppose yeah we are down Bel here if

[21:29:04 - 21:29:09]
you know pandas I know panda an okay

[21:29:07 - 21:29:11]
amount I'm not really good with pandas

[21:29:09 - 21:29:11]
per

[21:29:12 - 21:29:18]
se

[21:29:14 - 21:29:20]
and we will load this into

[21:29:18 - 21:29:22]
here then we have data preparation so

[21:29:20 - 21:29:25]
combine

[21:29:22 - 21:29:26]
attributes so here it this seems like

[21:29:25 - 21:29:29]
we're prepping the data to be in some

[21:29:26 - 21:29:30]
kind of format add a new column called

[21:29:29 - 21:29:32]
combined attributes okay so now we're

[21:29:30 - 21:29:33]
adding the combined attributes and I

[21:29:32 - 21:29:36]
think that's kind of a common technique

[21:29:33 - 21:29:38]
when when you searching stuff um in a

[21:29:36 - 21:29:41]
database you might make a new row

[21:29:38 - 21:29:42]
specifically with all the combined

[21:29:41 - 21:29:44]
information so it can do full teex

[21:29:42 - 21:29:46]
search across it I'm assuming that's why

[21:29:44 - 21:29:49]
why it's doing that and so now we're

[21:29:46 - 21:29:51]
displaying the full combining attributes

[21:29:49 - 21:29:53]
here we have the embedding generation so

[21:29:51 - 21:29:55]
we've did embeddings before when we used

[21:29:53 - 21:29:56]
pine cone so here is the same process

[21:29:55 - 21:29:58]
we're going to iterate through it and

[21:29:56 - 21:30:00]
create the embeddings and looks like

[21:29:58 - 21:30:02]
we're storing that into the data set the

[21:30:00 - 21:30:04]
embeddings so here it is I love the

[21:30:02 - 21:30:07]
progress bar this is a really well

[21:30:04 - 21:30:10]
ridden uh lab here so we'll give it a

[21:30:07 - 21:30:10]
moment there to

[21:30:12 - 21:30:15]
run

[21:30:13 - 21:30:17]
and uh I'm not sure why it's

[21:30:15 - 21:30:19]
complaining I've never seen this little

[21:30:17 - 21:30:22]
warning here

[21:30:19 - 21:30:24]
before but it does seem stopped oh we

[21:30:22 - 21:30:26]
did get an

[21:30:24 - 21:30:28]
error was limited 40 API calls per

[21:30:26 - 21:30:32]
minute so you can continue to use your

[21:30:28 - 21:30:34]
trial or wait so we will just need to

[21:30:32 - 21:30:37]
wait a few minutes okay

[21:30:34 - 21:30:38]
so we'll back here in just a minute okay

[21:30:37 - 21:30:39]
all right so I've waited a minute and

[21:30:38 - 21:30:41]
I'm going to go ahead and try to run

[21:30:39 - 21:30:43]
this again as I just believe that the

[21:30:41 - 21:30:46]
data set's very large so there we might

[21:30:43 - 21:30:48]
run to an issue so hopefully we can get

[21:30:46 - 21:30:51]
through that and we hit

[21:30:48 - 21:30:52]
64% where we're limited to 40 API calls

[21:30:51 - 21:30:54]
so I feel like if the data set was a

[21:30:52 - 21:30:56]
little bit smaller we could get through

[21:30:54 - 21:30:59]
this um so there's probably some way

[21:30:56 - 21:31:02]
that we could adjust

[21:30:59 - 21:31:06]
this let me see

[21:31:02 - 21:31:06]
here how could we reduce this data

[21:31:07 - 21:31:12]
set I do believe that like Google Gemini

[21:31:10 - 21:31:14]
is somewhere here if we go here don't we

[21:31:12 - 21:31:18]
have like AI coding assistant built into

[21:31:14 - 21:31:20]
this platform somewhere we

[21:31:18 - 21:31:23]
do I wonder if it would no I can only it

[21:31:20 - 21:31:24]
can only explain code so again I'm not

[21:31:23 - 21:31:26]
really good with panda so I'm just

[21:31:24 - 21:31:30]
trying to think about how we

[21:31:26 - 21:31:35]
can uh fix this let's go up do we have a

[21:31:30 - 21:31:35]
cond a combined data set

[21:31:35 - 21:31:40]
and I'm not sure how many data frames

[21:31:37 - 21:31:40]
are in our data set let's go up

[21:31:42 - 21:31:48]
here data data set take 100 so it's

[21:31:46 - 21:31:49]
taking a 100 from the data set and so

[21:31:48 - 21:31:52]
I'm thinking what we can

[21:31:49 - 21:31:54]
do is maybe what we can do is just cut

[21:31:52 - 21:31:57]
it in half like this let's do

[21:31:54 - 21:31:59]
that okay and so I'm kind of cheating

[21:31:57 - 21:32:01]
whoops I didn't mean to do that cancel I

[21:31:59 - 21:32:03]
tried to save it's just a a habit of

[21:32:01 - 21:32:06]
mine and so what we're doing instead is

[21:32:03 - 21:32:07]
we're Lo loading half that data set now

[21:32:06 - 21:32:10]
okay so we'll go ahead and do

[21:32:07 - 21:32:13]
this and we'll run this and we'll run

[21:32:10 - 21:32:15]
this and I'm going to just wait a minute

[21:32:13 - 21:32:17]
I'll be back in just a moment okay all

[21:32:15 - 21:32:19]
right we'll go ahead here and try to run

[21:32:17 - 21:32:22]
this again and so now we're using a much

[21:32:19 - 21:32:24]
smaller data sets I'm hoping oh we

[21:32:22 - 21:32:26]
almost got it okay so we're gonna we're

[21:32:24 - 21:32:28]
going to shrink it a bit more now of

[21:32:26 - 21:32:30]
course we can try to figure out a rate

[21:32:28 - 21:32:32]
limit this and be like okay you know

[21:32:30 - 21:32:35]
work a lot slower don't make as many

[21:32:32 - 21:32:38]
calls but I'm trying to do it in one go

[21:32:35 - 21:32:39]
so I'm going to turn this down to let's

[21:32:38 - 21:32:42]
say

[21:32:39 - 21:32:44]
40 okay whoops I keep hitting that save

[21:32:42 - 21:32:48]
button uh we'll

[21:32:44 - 21:32:50]
say maybe 35 we don't need the full data

[21:32:48 - 21:32:52]
set but I'm hoping that this will this

[21:32:50 - 21:32:54]
will get us where we need to go so I'm

[21:32:52 - 21:32:57]
going to go ahead and hit run here and

[21:32:54 - 21:32:58]
I'm going to run this one again and I'm

[21:32:57 - 21:33:00]
going to run this one again and I'm

[21:32:58 - 21:33:02]
going to run this one again and so I'm

[21:33:00 - 21:33:04]
going to wait another minute and this

[21:33:02 - 21:33:06]
time this time we're going to get it

[21:33:04 - 21:33:09]
all right um so I waited a generous two

[21:33:06 - 21:33:12]
minutes every time every time I'm

[21:33:09 - 21:33:14]
waiting I'm just watching this video

[21:33:12 - 21:33:16]
which is the uh the exit video to

[21:33:14 - 21:33:17]
Legends of the galactic heroes I don't

[21:33:16 - 21:33:20]
know I always like to watch that one but

[21:33:17 - 21:33:22]
we'll go ahead and we will run this uh

[21:33:20 - 21:33:25]
thing one more

[21:33:22 - 21:33:27]
time and we did it we cheated um we

[21:33:25 - 21:33:30]
cheated around the API we could have ran

[21:33:27 - 21:33:31]
the full set I just don't care um so

[21:33:30 - 21:33:33]
over here we have mongodb Vector setup

[21:33:31 - 21:33:35]
database so first create a mongodb atlas

[21:33:33 - 21:33:39]
account okay we have that uh select the

[21:33:35 - 21:33:40]
atlas UI create a database uh called

[21:33:39 - 21:33:43]
asset manage use case so let's go ahead

[21:33:40 - 21:33:46]
and follow it along here so we'll go

[21:33:43 - 21:33:49]
over to here and we need to I mean like

[21:33:46 - 21:33:50]
where is the Atlas UI I can't really

[21:33:49 - 21:33:51]
tell here but we can go ahead and create

[21:33:50 - 21:33:54]
ourselves a

[21:33:51 - 21:33:58]
cluster um and

[21:33:54 - 21:34:00]
so we do want a free one we absolutely

[21:33:58 - 21:34:04]
want that but how do I know let's go

[21:34:00 - 21:34:06]
back to those dogs

[21:34:04 - 21:34:09]
select the atlas UI as uh as the

[21:34:06 - 21:34:11]
procedure to deploy your first

[21:34:09 - 21:34:12]
cluster okay but what kind of cluster is

[21:34:11 - 21:34:14]
this going to deploy that's what I don't

[21:34:12 - 21:34:17]
I can't tell so let's go back here for a

[21:34:14 - 21:34:19]
second I mean there's atas

[21:34:17 - 21:34:20]
search you don't have a database

[21:34:19 - 21:34:22]
integrate with the search into your

[21:34:20 - 21:34:23]
application once your database is up and

[21:34:22 - 21:34:25]
running you can create a vector search

[21:34:23 - 21:34:27]
so it makes me think that first we have

[21:34:25 - 21:34:30]
to have a cluster right and then we add

[21:34:27 - 21:34:34]
ATL search right so uh we'll go ahead

[21:34:30 - 21:34:34]
build a database here still anyway

[21:34:36 - 21:34:39]
um we'll just reset here I don't care

[21:34:38 - 21:34:41]
what this is this looks like it's still

[21:34:39 - 21:34:42]
going to the same place it's just going

[21:34:41 - 21:34:43]
to building a new cluster yeah it is

[21:34:42 - 21:34:46]
okay great so we're going to go to our

[21:34:43 - 21:34:48]
free tier and the name is going to be

[21:34:46 - 21:34:50]
this we're going to name it this cluster

[21:34:48 - 21:34:52]
names can only be contain asking letters

[21:34:50 - 21:34:53]
numbers okay so that makes me think that

[21:34:52 - 21:34:56]
what we're doing here is different let's

[21:34:53 - 21:34:58]
read this again first

[21:34:56 - 21:34:59]
register long going to be Atlas account

[21:34:58 - 21:35:01]
follow the instructions let's go over

[21:34:59 - 21:35:05]
here follow the

[21:35:01 - 21:35:10]
instructions deploy a free

[21:35:05 - 21:35:13]
here Atlas UI log into Atlas go over to

[21:35:10 - 21:35:16]
organizations create a

[21:35:13 - 21:35:20]
cluster mzo clusters are free forever

[21:35:16 - 21:35:22]
and suitable for learning mongodb well

[21:35:20 - 21:35:24]
okay I believe that's what we chose it's

[21:35:22 - 21:35:26]
not called that this is 10 and we

[21:35:24 - 21:35:28]
have zero but then we go down

[21:35:26 - 21:35:31]
below here and saying that we cannot

[21:35:28 - 21:35:34]
name the cluster

[21:35:31 - 21:35:37]
this create the database

[21:35:34 - 21:35:40]
Asset Management use

[21:35:37 - 21:35:42]
case within the database create the

[21:35:40 - 21:35:43]
collection market reports so here if it

[21:35:42 - 21:35:46]
has a problem with the name we'll just

[21:35:43 - 21:35:47]
change it out so this is not a big deal

[21:35:46 - 21:35:49]
maybe something has changed since we

[21:35:47 - 21:35:53]
last used it so we go ahead and do this

[21:35:49 - 21:35:54]
and this okay great and uh yeah I don't

[21:35:53 - 21:35:56]
care where it goes it could be North

[21:35:54 - 21:35:58]
Virginia automatically security setup

[21:35:56 - 21:35:59]
preload data sample I don't think we

[21:35:58 - 21:36:01]
want a data sample loaded in here

[21:35:59 - 21:36:02]
because we are loading in our own data

[21:36:01 - 21:36:04]
we're going to go to Advanced

[21:36:02 - 21:36:05]
configuration cuz CU I'm not sure if

[21:36:04 - 21:36:07]
there's something else we need to see

[21:36:05 - 21:36:10]
here we'll go to

[21:36:07 - 21:36:13]
free wow there's way more options here

[21:36:10 - 21:36:15]
cluster capacity that sounds fine uh we

[21:36:13 - 21:36:17]
don't need termin ter termination

[21:36:15 - 21:36:19]
prodection and then here's the cluster

[21:36:17 - 21:36:22]
name again so I'm going to try again to

[21:36:19 - 21:36:24]
put the name in what a little pain this

[21:36:22 - 21:36:28]
is and so we'll go over to here and fix

[21:36:24 - 21:36:28]
this and we will create the

[21:36:29 - 21:36:33]
cluster um and so now we need to set

[21:36:31 - 21:36:35]
some uh stuff here so we'll go back over

[21:36:33 - 21:36:35]
to here

[21:36:36 - 21:36:39]
here okay so it's not saying what we

[21:36:38 - 21:36:41]
have to set here and so we need to set a

[21:36:39 - 21:36:43]
username so I'm just going to say um

[21:36:41 - 21:36:47]
admin and then the password is going to

[21:36:43 - 21:36:48]
be capital T testing 1 2 3 4 5 6

[21:36:47 - 21:36:49]
exclamation mark if you've watched any

[21:36:48 - 21:36:51]
of my videos you know that's how I

[21:36:49 - 21:36:53]
always do it the password contains

[21:36:51 - 21:36:56]
special characters which will be you you

[21:36:53 - 21:36:59]
encoded so what I'll do is I'll just do

[21:36:56 - 21:37:01]
capital T testing 1 two 3 four five six

[21:36:59 - 21:37:04]
and I will not do that one on the end

[21:37:01 - 21:37:06]
there with the um exclamation mark

[21:37:04 - 21:37:07]
and it looks like we already have a user

[21:37:06 - 21:37:09]
down here but we're going to create this

[21:37:07 - 21:37:11]
user anyway and so now we have this

[21:37:09 - 21:37:13]
admin user that we have here then we

[21:37:11 - 21:37:14]
have my local environment or Cloud

[21:37:13 - 21:37:17]
environment I'm not really worried about

[21:37:14 - 21:37:18]
this stuff right now um where would you

[21:37:17 - 21:37:20]
like to connect well technically my

[21:37:18 - 21:37:22]
cloud environment use this to add a

[21:37:20 - 21:37:24]
network IP address to the IP list you

[21:37:22 - 21:37:26]
can modify it any time use this to

[21:37:24 - 21:37:28]
configure network access between Atlas

[21:37:26 - 21:37:30]
and your configured stuff well that's

[21:37:28 - 21:37:33]
going to be kind of hard because this is

[21:37:30 - 21:37:36]
not on my local machine

[21:37:33 - 21:37:39]
right this is in wherever this thing is

[21:37:36 - 21:37:42]
and I'm not going to know what the the

[21:37:39 - 21:37:44]
IP address of this is so I'm not sure

[21:37:42 - 21:37:46]
what I'm going to do for

[21:37:44 - 21:37:49]
that

[21:37:46 - 21:37:51]
um I mean down below here it says 0000 Z

[21:37:49 - 21:37:52]
so it looks like it's already open to

[21:37:51 - 21:37:54]
the Internet so I'm going to go ahead

[21:37:52 - 21:37:56]
and hit finish because I believe that

[21:37:54 - 21:37:57]
this cluster is already open to the

[21:37:56 - 21:38:01]
internet I'm not going to have an issue

[21:37:57 - 21:38:01]
with it so now we have created our

[21:38:02 - 21:38:05]
cluster right

[21:38:05 - 21:38:09]
wa you're you're deploying zero three

[21:38:07 - 21:38:12]
changes so I think it's still deploying

[21:38:09 - 21:38:13]
it's not 100% done yet so that is what

[21:38:12 - 21:38:16]
we're waiting on here so I'm going to go

[21:38:13 - 21:38:19]
back to Atlas

[21:38:16 - 21:38:21]
here and we have project zero you may

[21:38:19 - 21:38:23]
have created had to create a project I

[21:38:21 - 21:38:26]
didn't and we have our cluster and so

[21:38:23 - 21:38:29]
here it is spinning up okay so let's go

[21:38:26 - 21:38:34]
back over to here

[21:38:29 - 21:38:34]
and so we have our data

[21:38:35 - 21:38:38]
okay and then we see that information

[21:38:37 - 21:38:40]
and then it's want going to want to know

[21:38:38 - 21:38:42]
our

[21:38:40 - 21:38:45]
URI so that would be the next thing that

[21:38:42 - 21:38:47]
we provide to it if I click connect it's

[21:38:45 - 21:38:50]
not ready yet but in here we should be

[21:38:47 - 21:38:50]
able to find I think through

[21:38:50 - 21:38:53]
drivers it's still provisioning so I

[21:38:52 - 21:38:54]
think here that's where we're going to

[21:38:53 - 21:38:57]
see our connection URL string so we're

[21:38:54 - 21:38:58]
going to wait oh here it is and we're

[21:38:57 - 21:38:59]
going to try that again so I'm going to

[21:38:58 - 21:39:01]
go hit connect I'm going to go to

[21:38:59 - 21:39:05]
drivers and then down below here it says

[21:39:01 - 21:39:05]
use connection string your application

[21:39:06 - 21:39:11]
I mean I actually want the real one here

[21:39:08 - 21:39:13]
it's saying DB username password so it

[21:39:11 - 21:39:15]
seems like I have to replace these

[21:39:13 - 21:39:18]
myself which is not a big deal and so

[21:39:15 - 21:39:20]
we'll go here and we said that this was

[21:39:18 - 21:39:20]
admin right

[21:39:21 - 21:39:29]
admin and then this one here is capital

[21:39:24 - 21:39:30]
T testing 1 2 3 4 5 6 right so that's

[21:39:29 - 21:39:31]
what it should be to get in here I also

[21:39:30 - 21:39:33]
kind of remember having to fiddle with

[21:39:31 - 21:39:35]
these at one point but I'm not sure if

[21:39:33 - 21:39:38]
that's still an issue so we going to go

[21:39:35 - 21:39:40]
ahead and set that uh

[21:39:38 - 21:39:42]
URI so the rest here should be

[21:39:40 - 21:39:43]
attempting to establish a connection to

[21:39:42 - 21:39:47]
mongodb here it's looking for a very

[21:39:43 - 21:39:50]
specific name it's not my fault that it

[21:39:47 - 21:39:52]
uses uh if does not allow underscore so

[21:39:50 - 21:39:53]
I'll change that to hyphens but I think

[21:39:52 - 21:39:57]
they said that we also had to create

[21:39:53 - 21:39:59]
something else right so if we go over to

[21:39:57 - 21:40:03]
here there's something else we have to

[21:39:59 - 21:40:05]
create um

[21:40:03 - 21:40:07]
for the mongod to be within the database

[21:40:05 - 21:40:08]
create a collection called market

[21:40:07 - 21:40:10]
reports so that is something else that

[21:40:08 - 21:40:15]
we have to create so we'll go back over

[21:40:10 - 21:40:15]
to our cluster um let's click into

[21:40:15 - 21:40:24]
this and I'm looking for where I

[21:40:20 - 21:40:26]
create that there so we have our

[21:40:24 - 21:40:30]
cluster

[21:40:26 - 21:40:32]
right and I need to make my

[21:40:30 - 21:40:33]
collection but the only way I could

[21:40:32 - 21:40:34]
think of doing that is I'd have to to

[21:40:33 - 21:40:37]
connect to it

[21:40:34 - 21:40:38]
literally unless we're supposed to go

[21:40:37 - 21:40:40]
here to add the search and then create

[21:40:38 - 21:40:40]
it from

[21:40:43 - 21:40:46]
here yeah here's a

[21:40:48 - 21:40:53]
collection can I add it

[21:40:55 - 21:40:59]
here I don't want to do any I just want

[21:40:57 - 21:41:03]
to put one in here so again I'm trying

[21:40:59 - 21:41:07]
to find a way that I can insert this

[21:41:03 - 21:41:09]
[Music]

[21:41:07 - 21:41:12]
let's browse collections

[21:41:09 - 21:41:14]
here so yeah we currently don't have any

[21:41:12 - 21:41:16]
collections create the collection I

[21:41:14 - 21:41:17]
guess this is what we're doing right now

[21:41:16 - 21:41:19]
then create the vector search index so

[21:41:17 - 21:41:20]
I'm just going to ignore this and maybe

[21:41:19 - 21:41:23]
through this we actually are doing it

[21:41:20 - 21:41:24]
through these steps so yeah here we're

[21:41:23 - 21:41:27]
going to establish a connection let's go

[21:41:24 - 21:41:27]
ahead and try

[21:41:27 - 21:41:31]
that yeah here it says get database and

[21:41:29 - 21:41:33]
get Conn get connection so it establish

[21:41:31 - 21:41:35]
a connection

[21:41:33 - 21:41:37]
did it get the collection cuz I didn't

[21:41:35 - 21:41:39]
make

[21:41:37 - 21:41:42]
one here it will delete any data if it

[21:41:39 - 21:41:44]
already exists I mean if it just works

[21:41:42 - 21:41:46]
it'll insert it so we'll go ahead here

[21:41:44 - 21:41:48]
and just say insert into the collection

[21:41:46 - 21:41:50]
it says it inserted it so maybe it

[21:41:48 - 21:41:53]
created The Collection indirectly let's

[21:41:50 - 21:41:53]
go give this a hard refresh let's

[21:41:54 - 21:41:58]
see there it is okay great so we didn't

[21:41:57 - 21:42:00]
have to do anything there it just

[21:41:58 - 21:42:02]
created ourselves obviously we had to uh

[21:42:00 - 21:42:04]
make a a name change there but that's

[21:42:02 - 21:42:05]
what I thought so we'll go down below

[21:42:04 - 21:42:09]
and here now it's talking about the

[21:42:05 - 21:42:11]
mongodb query language and Vector

[21:42:09 - 21:42:16]
search okay

[21:42:11 - 21:42:16]
so we can go ahead here and press

[21:42:18 - 21:42:23]
this okay and then they're talking about

[21:42:21 - 21:42:26]
the coh here

[21:42:23 - 21:42:28]
ranker so the idea here is that you're

[21:42:26 - 21:42:30]
querying we haven't ran anything yet

[21:42:28 - 21:42:31]
we're just defining functions right now

[21:42:30 - 21:42:33]
but the idea is that we are quering

[21:42:31 - 21:42:35]
something it's going to return it back

[21:42:33 - 21:42:37]
and then coh here is going to rerank it

[21:42:35 - 21:42:41]
for relevance and then that's going to

[21:42:37 - 21:42:42]
help it uh produce more relevant results

[21:42:41 - 21:42:45]
so go ahead and run this

[21:42:42 - 21:42:48]
next so what companies are NE have

[21:42:45 - 21:42:51]
negative reports uh or negative stim uh

[21:42:48 - 21:42:53]
sent sentiment that might deter from

[21:42:51 - 21:42:55]
investment long term and so there we

[21:42:53 - 21:42:58]
have some stuff handling user

[21:42:55 - 21:42:59]
queries okay named reranked documents is

[21:42:58 - 21:43:03]
not

[21:42:59 - 21:43:06]
defined did we not run it right here

[21:43:03 - 21:43:06]
and then we run it

[21:43:10 - 21:43:15]
here and I mean I believe it's

[21:43:13 - 21:43:17]
working here it is using coh here down

[21:43:15 - 21:43:20]
here with the chat okay so it came back

[21:43:17 - 21:43:23]
here and so this one

[21:43:20 - 21:43:25]
here it's bringing in the documents so

[21:43:23 - 21:43:26]
here we have format documents for chat

[21:43:25 - 21:43:28]
and then bring in the reranked documents

[21:43:26 - 21:43:30]
so we've already pulled the data and

[21:43:28 - 21:43:32]
then we're providing the documents to

[21:43:30 - 21:43:34]
coh here because that's how their API

[21:43:32 - 21:43:36]
works at least with this version

[21:43:34 - 21:43:38]
um and then we can see the final results

[21:43:36 - 21:43:41]
and then we can cite the

[21:43:38 - 21:43:43]
papers and so then we have using mongodb

[21:43:41 - 21:43:44]
as a data store for conversation history

[21:43:43 - 21:43:46]
that's of course another thing that we

[21:43:44 - 21:43:48]
can do with mongodb I'm more interested

[21:43:46 - 21:43:49]
in the rag side of it but you know

[21:43:48 - 21:43:51]
hopefully it's clear what's happening is

[21:43:49 - 21:43:53]
that we are querying mongodb for that

[21:43:51 - 21:43:55]
data we're then passing into the coher

[21:43:53 - 21:43:59]
re ranker and then we are seeing the

[21:43:55 - 21:44:01]
results now is this a good example I

[21:43:59 - 21:44:02]
don't know if the data if I understood

[21:44:01 - 21:44:04]
the data better or if it was a smaller

[21:44:02 - 21:44:06]
example I probably would be able to make

[21:44:04 - 21:44:08]
better sense of it but you can see it's

[21:44:06 - 21:44:10]
pretty similar to the last one when we

[21:44:08 - 21:44:11]
did um when we worked with elastic

[21:44:10 - 21:44:13]
search but here we're just using

[21:44:11 - 21:44:15]
documents to put it and then it's going

[21:44:13 - 21:44:17]
to embed it into the context window

[21:44:15 - 21:44:18]
however it wants to but it's not that

[21:44:17 - 21:44:20]
different from the other one so there

[21:44:18 - 21:44:22]
you go we got it working U that's all I

[21:44:20 - 21:44:24]
really wanted to show you uh and we'll

[21:44:22 - 21:44:26]
call this one done I'm going to get rid

[21:44:24 - 21:44:29]
of that cluster just because sometimes I

[21:44:26 - 21:44:30]
forget to uh do that and by getting rid

[21:44:29 - 21:44:33]
of it now I just want to deal with it

[21:44:30 - 21:44:36]
later um so I'm going to go over here

[21:44:33 - 21:44:40]
and figure out how to delete this

[21:44:36 - 21:44:42]
cluster we'll terminate this here here

[21:44:40 - 21:44:45]
we go and we'll just say terminate

[21:44:42 - 21:44:46]
terminate and we'll say bye-bye cluster

[21:44:45 - 21:44:48]
and we are all done here I'll see you in

[21:44:46 - 21:44:51]
the next one okay

[21:44:48 - 21:44:54]
[Music]

[21:44:51 - 21:44:55]
ciao hey this is Angie Brown in this

[21:44:54 - 21:44:58]
video I want to take a look at using

[21:44:55 - 21:45:00]
postrest as a um as a vector store

[21:44:58 - 21:45:01]
because I know that we can do that so

[21:45:00 - 21:45:03]
what I'm going to do is open this

[21:45:01 - 21:45:07]
environment up in GitHub Dev I clearly

[21:45:03 - 21:45:09]
had an older one here um at GitHub code

[21:45:07 - 21:45:12]
spaces I said GitHub Dev which was an

[21:45:09 - 21:45:13]
accident and we'll open this up and I

[21:45:12 - 21:45:15]
think what we'll do is we'll get a bit

[21:45:13 - 21:45:17]
of help from claw since I'm paying for

[21:45:15 - 21:45:19]
Claude I better start using it and I'm

[21:45:17 - 21:45:22]
going to say can you give

[21:45:19 - 21:45:25]
me a simple code

[21:45:22 - 21:45:28]
example of using

[21:45:25 - 21:45:30]
postgress as a vector store because it

[21:45:28 - 21:45:33]
has an extension to that we can utilize

[21:45:30 - 21:45:35]
for it here

[21:45:33 - 21:45:38]
yeah PG Vector is what we're we're

[21:45:35 - 21:45:38]
talking about

[21:45:45 - 21:45:52]
here it sure doesn't look simple but

[21:45:49 - 21:45:55]
um I think it's something we can

[21:45:52 - 21:45:57]
manage so what I'm going to do is we're

[21:45:55 - 21:46:00]
going to come over to gen Essentials and

[21:45:57 - 21:46:02]
I'm going to go bring this into a dark

[21:46:00 - 21:46:05]
mode theme I'm going to make a new

[21:46:02 - 21:46:08]
folder here called PG

[21:46:05 - 21:46:08]
Vector okay

[21:46:09 - 21:46:12]
well we want to give a permission to

[21:46:11 - 21:46:14]
there we go we fixed the permission here

[21:46:12 - 21:46:17]
good reload I don't know it's being a

[21:46:14 - 21:46:21]
bit finicky here today um and I'm going

[21:46:17 - 21:46:21]
to make a new folder here called PG

[21:46:22 - 21:46:31]
Vector okay uh can you give me code to

[21:46:26 - 21:46:33]
run uh postgress via a Docker container

[21:46:31 - 21:46:34]
I have sample code lying around espe

[21:46:33 - 21:46:36]
from previous boot camps but I'm going

[21:46:34 - 21:46:39]
to go ahead and just ask it to do it for

[21:46:36 - 21:46:39]
us we'll say PG

[21:46:42 - 21:46:47]
vector and I'm G to see if we get some

[21:46:44 - 21:46:50]
nice Docker set up

[21:46:47 - 21:46:52]
here great give me the code please what

[21:46:50 - 21:46:55]
the heck is Vector

[21:46:52 - 21:46:57]
DB oh it's saying as the database okay

[21:46:55 - 21:47:00]
great okay so here's the

[21:46:57 - 21:47:01]
file uh there's a lot going on in here I

[21:47:00 - 21:47:02]
don't think this is everything I think

[21:47:01 - 21:47:05]
yeah this is the docker file okay so

[21:47:02 - 21:47:08]
we'll grab this and I'll go back over to

[21:47:05 - 21:47:08]
here and we'll make a new Docker

[21:47:09 - 21:47:12]
file and we'll paste that in I'm not

[21:47:11 - 21:47:15]
sure what the lasest version of postest

[21:47:12 - 21:47:16]
is but 15 sounds okay to me as long as

[21:47:15 - 21:47:18]
it works that's all I care

[21:47:16 - 21:47:22]
about

[21:47:18 - 21:47:25]
and then we have our Docker compos yl

[21:47:22 - 21:47:28]
file which I missed this

[21:47:25 - 21:47:31]
here let's go ahead and do that so I'm

[21:47:28 - 21:47:33]
going to go and say docker composed.

[21:47:31 - 21:47:35]
yaml

[21:47:33 - 21:47:37]
and we'll paste that on in here so that

[21:47:35 - 21:47:39]
will set it up we um are clearly setting

[21:47:37 - 21:47:41]
up our username password right there in

[21:47:39 - 21:47:43]
line that's totally fine it's going to

[21:47:41 - 21:47:46]
run on 5432 which makes sense we are

[21:47:43 - 21:47:49]
mounting this volume so the data is not

[21:47:46 - 21:47:52]
within the container it's mounted to uh

[21:47:49 - 21:47:55]
this environment here

[21:47:52 - 21:47:58]
um sorry I'm not sure why this is left

[21:47:55 - 21:48:01]
blank I don't know if that actually

[21:47:58 - 21:48:03]
matters oh unless it's following with

[21:48:01 - 21:48:05]
the no no that doesn't why is that

[21:48:03 - 21:48:07]
blank so I'm not sure if that's an issue

[21:48:05 - 21:48:10]
but I guess we'll find out then we have

[21:48:07 - 21:48:12]
some initialized initial initial SQL so

[21:48:10 - 21:48:14]
I'm going to grab this and I'm going to

[21:48:12 - 21:48:16]
make this here I assume we'll have to

[21:48:14 - 21:48:17]
run this

[21:48:16 - 21:48:20]
manually

[21:48:17 - 21:48:23]
SQL and we'll paste it in here I'll go

[21:48:20 - 21:48:24]
back over to here and we do have some

[21:48:23 - 21:48:25]
environment variables I'm not sure why

[21:48:24 - 21:48:28]
we have to set it there when they're

[21:48:25 - 21:48:30]
getting set somewhere else but maybe we

[21:48:28 - 21:48:31]
will need this here later on there's

[21:48:30 - 21:48:33]
nothing sensitive here so this is not a

[21:48:31 - 21:48:35]
big deal

[21:48:33 - 21:48:38]
um and so yeah we should be able to do

[21:48:35 - 21:48:40]
Docker compose up I'm very skeptical of

[21:48:38 - 21:48:43]
this empty part here but maybe we'll

[21:48:40 - 21:48:46]
find out that it's not an issue so we'll

[21:48:43 - 21:48:48]
go here and type in PG Vector folder I'm

[21:48:46 - 21:48:50]
going to go ahead and do Docker compose

[21:48:48 - 21:48:52]
up how would it know because we'd have

[21:48:50 - 21:48:53]
to create the database how would it know

[21:48:52 - 21:48:55]
that the extension is enabled but maybe

[21:48:53 - 21:48:58]
we'll take a look at our extension or it

[21:48:55 - 21:49:00]
it SQL and so it enables PG Vector right

[21:48:58 - 21:49:02]
here as an extension that's usually what

[21:49:00 - 21:49:03]
you do with postgress is you will enable

[21:49:02 - 21:49:05]
them there here it's creating a document

[21:49:03 - 21:49:07]
embeddings table if it doesn't exist and

[21:49:05 - 21:49:09]
then the embeddings idx if we go to the

[21:49:07 - 21:49:11]
docker file um it's not like it's

[21:49:09 - 21:49:12]
loading it in anywhere here it would

[21:49:11 - 21:49:15]
have been nice if it set it up there but

[21:49:12 - 21:49:17]
if it doesn't that's totally fine um

[21:49:15 - 21:49:20]
we'll go to our Docker compos amble file

[21:49:17 - 21:49:21]
okay so here it is pulling the file here

[21:49:20 - 21:49:26]
okay great so it's good that we put it

[21:49:21 - 21:49:28]
in there and it's putting it here in the

[21:49:26 - 21:49:31]
volume I guess it's fine but I guess

[21:49:28 - 21:49:33]
that way that when we connect to the

[21:49:31 - 21:49:35]
docker container we can just run it in

[21:49:33 - 21:49:38]
place I feel like this is not really

[21:49:35 - 21:49:40]
necessary but it's totally fine like

[21:49:38 - 21:49:42]
it's not going to initial initially load

[21:49:40 - 21:49:42]
it I don't think it

[21:49:43 - 21:49:47]
would so we'll just wait for this to

[21:49:45 - 21:49:49]
build all right so our container is

[21:49:47 - 21:49:52]
running on Port

[21:49:49 - 21:49:55]
5432 um now we should be able to install

[21:49:52 - 21:49:58]
maybe some kind of database uh viewer um

[21:49:55 - 21:50:00]
so I just type in postest here there

[21:49:58 - 21:50:04]
might be like a generic one that we can

[21:50:00 - 21:50:04]
utilize um

[21:50:07 - 21:50:10]
is not meant for creating dropping

[21:50:08 - 21:50:12]
tables is a visual aid for crafting your

[21:50:10 - 21:50:14]
queries sure I don't care I mean we

[21:50:12 - 21:50:16]
don't need to use that to create uh the

[21:50:14 - 21:50:18]
things I just need to see something so

[21:50:16 - 21:50:19]
we'll go ahead and install that one um

[21:50:18 - 21:50:21]
is that the most popular one it looks

[21:50:19 - 21:50:23]
like it's very popular so we'll go ahead

[21:50:21 - 21:50:26]
into here so right now there are no

[21:50:23 - 21:50:28]
databases that is no surprise unless we

[21:50:26 - 21:50:30]
have to create a connection

[21:50:28 - 21:50:34]
[Music]

[21:50:30 - 21:50:36]
first I mean it is running 5432 so we

[21:50:34 - 21:50:40]
should just be able to hit enter here

[21:50:36 - 21:50:40]
say 127.0.0.1

[21:50:41 - 21:50:50]
the uh thing is Vector

[21:50:44 - 21:50:50]
DB vector and the password Here is

[21:50:50 - 21:50:57]
vector vector DB 5 for 32 I do not want

[21:50:55 - 21:50:59]
to save that well thank you and it

[21:50:57 - 21:51:01]
should be on Port 5432 it's using a

[21:50:59 - 21:51:04]
standard connection um the database name

[21:51:01 - 21:51:07]
is Vector DB and I definitely put in the

[21:51:04 - 21:51:07]
wrong

[21:51:09 - 21:51:14]
password okay so the connection failed

[21:51:12 - 21:51:17]
so we'll go back a couple steps here and

[21:51:14 - 21:51:19]
this is supposed to be Vector

[21:51:17 - 21:51:22]
pass I can't say I really like this

[21:51:19 - 21:51:24]
interface um it's not the one I usually

[21:51:22 - 21:51:27]
use and so here we can see the vector

[21:51:24 - 21:51:28]
database we'll hit enter so now we have

[21:51:27 - 21:51:30]
an established connecting to this Vector

[21:51:28 - 21:51:33]
database um I'm curious do we have

[21:51:30 - 21:51:37]
documents so it looks like nsql got

[21:51:33 - 21:51:39]
picked up AIT SQL is that a thing for

[21:51:37 - 21:51:41]
postgress okay so that actually is a

[21:51:39 - 21:51:41]
thing I didn't know

[21:51:44 - 21:51:49]
that how did it know to pick it up well

[21:51:47 - 21:51:51]
anyway that's interesting because now

[21:51:49 - 21:51:52]
our our table is set up for the stuff

[21:51:51 - 21:51:56]
that we need so that mean that's really

[21:51:52 - 21:51:58]
good um I guess my thought next is um

[21:51:56 - 21:52:03]
what can we do so let's go back over to

[21:51:58 - 21:52:05]
here and if we go here into our Vector

[21:52:03 - 21:52:07]
store example we do have some code I'm

[21:52:05 - 21:52:09]
not sure how good this code is we'll go

[21:52:07 - 21:52:11]
ahead and copy

[21:52:09 - 21:52:14]
it

[21:52:11 - 21:52:16]
um I'm going to make a iron python file

[21:52:14 - 21:52:20]
so this will be basic. iy

[21:52:16 - 21:52:21]
andb and we will make a new block of

[21:52:20 - 21:52:25]
code here we'll paste it in and we do

[21:52:21 - 21:52:25]
have a lot of stuff

[21:52:28 - 21:52:34]
here okay so I'm going to go here and

[21:52:30 - 21:52:34]
I'm going to bring this up to the top

[21:52:34 - 21:52:37]
come on drag up or maybe drag this one

[21:52:36 - 21:52:39]
down below that might be a little bit

[21:52:37 - 21:52:41]
easier and let's just choose the kernel

[21:52:39 - 21:52:42]
so that we get some um highlighting here

[21:52:41 - 21:52:45]
because it's a little bit annoying when

[21:52:42 - 21:52:45]
we don't have

[21:52:45 - 21:52:51]
highlighting and so we have a

[21:52:48 - 21:52:53]
class we can add documents and do

[21:52:51 - 21:52:55]
similarity

[21:52:53 - 21:52:56]
search and then down below we have our

[21:52:55 - 21:53:00]
example

[21:52:56 - 21:53:03]
code so I'm GNA cut this out of

[21:53:00 - 21:53:06]
here python python 312 that's totally

[21:53:03 - 21:53:07]
fine and I'm going to go ahead and paste

[21:53:06 - 21:53:10]
this

[21:53:07 - 21:53:11]
in I imagine we wouldn't have pyop

[21:53:10 - 21:53:12]
installed so I'm going to go ahead here

[21:53:11 - 21:53:15]
and

[21:53:12 - 21:53:16]
drag sometimes easier drag the ones

[21:53:15 - 21:53:19]
below

[21:53:16 - 21:53:21]
it this one

[21:53:19 - 21:53:24]
below and so I think we'll have to

[21:53:21 - 21:53:27]
probably do pip

[21:53:24 - 21:53:30]
install cyop also I can't imagine we'd

[21:53:27 - 21:53:31]
have numpy in here let's go ahead and do

[21:53:30 - 21:53:34]
that and hopefully those two will

[21:53:31 - 21:53:34]
install

[21:53:35 - 21:53:42]
I don't know if there's like ayop PG ory

[21:53:39 - 21:53:43]
psycho oh it's psycho I've been calling

[21:53:42 - 21:53:46]
it pyop for so many years but it's

[21:53:43 - 21:53:48]
psycho pg2 there might be a version

[21:53:46 - 21:53:50]
three I'm not sure but I'm going to just

[21:53:48 - 21:53:52]
use whatever works here um so we'll go

[21:53:50 - 21:53:54]
ahead and run this so that works and

[21:53:52 - 21:53:55]
then we're going to initialize our class

[21:53:54 - 21:53:58]
so let's see what's happening here you

[21:53:55 - 21:53:59]
pass the connection string to it okay it

[21:53:58 - 21:54:01]
sets up the database we don't need to

[21:53:59 - 21:54:03]
set up the database so we're going to go

[21:54:01 - 21:54:08]
back over to here uh you know can you

[21:54:03 - 21:54:12]
update the class because we don't need

[21:54:08 - 21:54:17]
it to set up the database let's just see

[21:54:12 - 21:54:17]
if it can um refactor our code

[21:54:18 - 21:54:22]
there because really all it needs to do

[21:54:20 - 21:54:24]
is add documents and things like

[21:54:22 - 21:54:27]
that so it seems like it's as simple as

[21:54:24 - 21:54:30]
just deleting out those functions but

[21:54:27 - 21:54:31]
we'll go ahead and copy this now cla's

[21:54:30 - 21:54:35]
pretty good at producing good code so

[21:54:31 - 21:54:37]
I'm pretty confident that this will will

[21:54:35 - 21:54:39]
work we will not know until we work with

[21:54:37 - 21:54:42]
this

[21:54:39 - 21:54:42]
here

[21:54:42 - 21:54:48]
okay and so we'll paste it in here like

[21:54:45 - 21:54:49]
this and so this needs a connection

[21:54:48 - 21:54:51]
string URL we'll go down to our

[21:54:49 - 21:54:53]
implementation down below this is

[21:54:51 - 21:54:55]
getting our our string which looks

[21:54:53 - 21:54:57]
correct here we have some sample

[21:54:55 - 21:54:59]
documents that we can insert so yeah

[21:54:57 - 21:54:59]
let's see if this

[21:55:01 - 21:55:04]
works okay

[21:55:04 - 21:55:09]
okay if it does Works that'd be awesome

[21:55:07 - 21:55:12]
and it doesn't so password

[21:55:09 - 21:55:13]
authentication failed for username um

[21:55:12 - 21:55:16]
that's because this isn't the username

[21:55:13 - 21:55:18]
so this is a vector DB and then it's

[21:55:16 - 21:55:22]
Vector

[21:55:18 - 21:55:22]
pass and so we'll try that

[21:55:23 - 21:55:29]
again and cannot adopt

[21:55:27 - 21:55:30]
dictionary what line does it have a

[21:55:29 - 21:55:32]
problem with

[21:55:30 - 21:55:35]
this um

[21:55:32 - 21:55:35]
Parts

[21:55:38 - 21:55:44]
append so

[21:55:40 - 21:55:44]
somewhere the format's not

[21:55:45 - 21:55:48]
correct so I'm just carefully looking

[21:55:47 - 21:55:50]
through this to see where the issue

[21:55:48 - 21:55:51]
could be maybe it's the sample document

[21:55:50 - 21:55:53]
that it doesn't like because that's the

[21:55:51 - 21:55:56]
only dictionary that I'm seeing here uh

[21:55:53 - 21:55:59]
right now that could be an

[21:55:56 - 21:56:02]
issue yeah add documents so store add

[21:55:59 - 21:56:06]
documents

[21:56:02 - 21:56:06]
and here it's saying

[21:56:06 - 21:56:12]
um so we'll go over here and we'll just

[21:56:10 - 21:56:16]
give it back some of the information

[21:56:12 - 21:56:18]
here and then maybe you can correct

[21:56:16 - 21:56:19]
it but clearly it's some some way it's

[21:56:18 - 21:56:21]
formatting so we need to convert the

[21:56:19 - 21:56:26]
dictionary metad dat adjacent format

[21:56:21 - 21:56:26]
before inserting into post CR fair

[21:56:29 - 21:56:36]
enough so it seems like

[21:56:33 - 21:56:36]
there's some formatting

[21:56:37 - 21:56:43]
issue okay so we'll bring this here

[21:56:40 - 21:56:43]
we'll go back over to

[21:56:43 - 21:56:47]
here and not this

[21:56:49 - 21:56:53]
one yeah so somewhere here it's doing

[21:56:52 - 21:56:55]
some kind of formatting so clearly it

[21:56:53 - 21:56:58]
wasn't being formatted correctly we'll

[21:56:55 - 21:57:01]
try this again and Json is not defined

[21:56:58 - 21:57:03]
well fair enough um we'll just go import

[21:57:01 - 21:57:04]
that here

[21:57:03 - 21:57:06]
import

[21:57:04 - 21:57:08]
Jason and I don't think we have to run

[21:57:06 - 21:57:10]
the class again but we'll run it again

[21:57:08 - 21:57:12]
and then we'll run

[21:57:10 - 21:57:17]
this Jason's not

[21:57:12 - 21:57:17]
defined uhuh that's why we imported it

[21:57:20 - 21:57:25]
right I do not see where this line is

[21:57:22 - 21:57:25]
Jason oh it's right

[21:57:27 - 21:57:33]
here oh from this okay great okay so

[21:57:30 - 21:57:36]
we'll copy this

[21:57:33 - 21:57:38]
it's really here it has its own Json

[21:57:36 - 21:57:41]
structure we run this then we'll run

[21:57:38 - 21:57:44]
that we'll scroll on down we'll run

[21:57:41 - 21:57:46]
this um no operator matches given name

[21:57:44 - 21:57:49]
arguments types you might need to add

[21:57:46 - 21:57:50]
explicit type casting oh my goodness so

[21:57:49 - 21:57:53]
I mean at least it's getting close to

[21:57:50 - 21:57:53]
producing what we

[21:57:57 - 21:58:01]
want MH

[21:58:05 - 21:58:10]
yeah so again it's done something

[21:58:08 - 21:58:13]
here worst case we can always read the

[21:58:10 - 21:58:14]
code and make sense of it it's not that

[21:58:13 - 21:58:15]
big of a deal but I'd rather get a

[21:58:14 - 21:58:16]
working person and then read the code

[21:58:15 - 21:58:19]
which is kind of backwards but that's

[21:58:16 - 21:58:20]
totally fine so we'll go that's our

[21:58:19 - 21:58:22]
example code here we'll go ahead and

[21:58:20 - 21:58:25]
grab

[21:58:22 - 21:58:27]
this and then we'll hit

[21:58:25 - 21:58:29]
run I was just hoping that it would work

[21:58:27 - 21:58:31]
oh there we go okay so great so we have

[21:58:29 - 21:58:33]
a working example let's now go read our

[21:58:31 - 21:58:36]
code and see what's going on here so the

[21:58:33 - 21:58:39]
idea is that we have uh PG Vector store

[21:58:36 - 21:58:42]
right and we have some sample documents

[21:58:39 - 21:58:46]
and so in here we have some

[21:58:42 - 21:58:48]
text um here I'm not sure I guess what

[21:58:46 - 21:58:49]
it's saying is that it's just randomly

[21:58:48 - 21:58:51]
creating the embedding so this is not

[21:58:49 - 21:58:53]
the real embedding but if we were to

[21:58:51 - 21:58:56]
store this in the database we'd actually

[21:58:53 - 21:58:57]
need an embedding Library so I guess

[21:58:56 - 21:58:59]
what they're saying here is like this is

[21:58:57 - 21:59:00]
the text representation and this is the

[21:58:59 - 21:59:03]
embedding

[21:59:00 - 21:59:06]
example right um and then down below

[21:59:03 - 21:59:10]
here you can see it's we're adding the

[21:59:06 - 21:59:12]
documents and it says MPR random 3842

[21:59:10 - 21:59:14]
list so replace with a real query

[21:59:12 - 21:59:16]
embedding okay and then doing a

[21:59:14 - 21:59:18]
similarity search and stuff like that so

[21:59:16 - 21:59:22]
maybe there is a real embedding weing

[21:59:18 - 21:59:25]
can we use a real opsource uh uh

[21:59:22 - 21:59:25]
embedding

[21:59:26 - 21:59:29]
library because it's not really doing

[21:59:27 - 21:59:31]
real

[21:59:29 - 21:59:32]
embeddings so here's talking about all

[21:59:31 - 21:59:35]
mini

[21:59:32 - 21:59:37]
uh L L6 V2 let's go take a look at that

[21:59:35 - 21:59:38]
before we go use it oh it's by sentence

[21:59:37 - 21:59:40]
Transformers okay so that's what I was

[21:59:38 - 21:59:41]
thinking that maybe something like

[21:59:40 - 21:59:43]
sentence Transformers would be a use

[21:59:41 - 21:59:45]
case that we could utilize so we'll go

[21:59:43 - 21:59:46]
ahead over here I'm going to scroll up

[21:59:45 - 21:59:49]
and we will place in sentence

[21:59:46 - 21:59:51]
Transformers whoops that's not what we

[21:59:49 - 21:59:55]
want we'll go back over to here to our

[21:59:51 - 21:59:57]
code and we'll grab sentence

[21:59:55 - 21:59:58]
Transformers and then we will paste it

[21:59:57 - 22:00:03]
in here as

[21:59:58 - 22:00:04]
such um then we'll go back over to here

[22:00:03 - 22:00:07]
and so now I'm just carefully looking at

[22:00:04 - 22:00:09]
what it's changed so here it's passing

[22:00:07 - 22:00:09]
the model

[22:00:12 - 22:00:16]
name I guess the code looks more or less

[22:00:14 - 22:00:20]
the

[22:00:16 - 22:00:20]
same so grab

[22:00:21 - 22:00:25]
this looks like it added a lot more

[22:00:23 - 22:00:30]
documentation I'm not sure

[22:00:25 - 22:00:33]
why um but here we see

[22:00:30 - 22:00:35]
model so s Transformer is being loaded

[22:00:33 - 22:00:36]
and then we're doing model and code

[22:00:35 - 22:00:40]
using that particular model so it's

[22:00:36 - 22:00:42]
doing that great and so then in here I

[22:00:40 - 22:00:45]
imagine that we might see some of that

[22:00:42 - 22:00:48]
here as well so we'll go down

[22:00:45 - 22:00:48]
below um oh it actually updated the uh

[22:00:48 - 22:00:51]
Vector

[22:00:48 - 22:00:54]
store so that's good like the connection

[22:00:51 - 22:00:55]
string was not correct before and we'll

[22:00:54 - 22:00:56]
go down here we're getting different

[22:00:55 - 22:01:00]
kinds of data to insert which is totally

[22:00:56 - 22:01:04]
fine so we'll go ahead and paste this in

[22:01:00 - 22:01:06]
here and so now we have a bunch of text

[22:01:04 - 22:01:08]
we have Associated metadata with each

[22:01:06 - 22:01:10]
text and so we're saying add the text

[22:01:08 - 22:01:12]
and so it did create a new function up

[22:01:10 - 22:01:15]
here and so in

[22:01:12 - 22:01:17]
here it's going to encode each one and

[22:01:15 - 22:01:19]
return back the documents and then

[22:01:17 - 22:01:20]
insert the documents for us so they've

[22:01:19 - 22:01:22]
kind of they've definitely refactored

[22:01:20 - 22:01:23]
this in another way so instead of add

[22:01:22 - 22:01:25]
documents they renamed to add text I

[22:01:23 - 22:01:26]
don't know why they renamed it and then

[22:01:25 - 22:01:30]
we have our similarity search so let's

[22:01:26 - 22:01:33]
go ahead and run this and then we'll run

[22:01:30 - 22:01:34]
that um um oh right right right we'll go

[22:01:33 - 22:01:37]
all the way to the top so we'll go to

[22:01:34 - 22:01:39]
the top and actually we need to uh

[22:01:37 - 22:01:41]
install sentence Transformers so let's

[22:01:39 - 22:01:45]
go back over to sentence Transformers

[22:01:41 - 22:01:47]
and grab this here and then we'll run

[22:01:45 - 22:01:50]
this great that we actually got to use

[22:01:47 - 22:01:51]
sentence Transformers for embeddings so

[22:01:50 - 22:01:53]
because we we talked about it before

[22:01:51 - 22:01:55]
espert earlier in that that part of the

[22:01:53 - 22:01:58]
video but I wasn't sure if we'd actually

[22:01:55 - 22:02:00]
get to utilize it in this kind of manner

[22:01:58 - 22:02:02]
so we'll wait for this to finish

[22:02:00 - 22:02:03]
installing there we go and then we'll go

[22:02:02 - 22:02:06]
ahead and run

[22:02:03 - 22:02:09]
this uh it's like highlighting as if

[22:02:06 - 22:02:12]
it's not utilizing it but hopefully it

[22:02:09 - 22:02:15]
does we'll go ahead and run

[22:02:12 - 22:02:18]
this and then we'll run

[22:02:15 - 22:02:21]
this and there we go and so we've done a

[22:02:18 - 22:02:23]
similarity search we've used postgress

[22:02:21 - 22:02:26]
as a vector store um postgress is okay

[22:02:23 - 22:02:28]
early on uh in terms of production you

[22:02:26 - 22:02:30]
probably don't want to use post grass

[22:02:28 - 22:02:31]
but again it depends on the scope of

[22:02:30 - 22:02:32]
your project so it's up to you to figure

[22:02:31 - 22:02:34]
that out

[22:02:32 - 22:02:36]
that is our postgress example with PG

[22:02:34 - 22:02:36]
Vector

[22:02:37 - 22:02:41]
store there we

[22:02:38 - 22:02:42]
go and I will see you in the next one

[22:02:41 - 22:02:46]
okay

[22:02:42 - 22:02:48]
[Music]

[22:02:46 - 22:02:50]
ciao hey this is Andrew Brown I want to

[22:02:48 - 22:02:52]
take a look at Ser API as this is

[22:02:50 - 22:02:53]
something that will be commonly used to

[22:02:52 - 22:02:56]
search out to the internet and you will

[22:02:53 - 22:03:00]
see Sur there's another competing uh one

[22:02:56 - 22:03:02]
so there's like Ser versus Ser API

[22:03:00 - 22:03:04]
versus

[22:03:02 - 22:03:08]
uh was it talvi talvi yeah that's the

[22:03:04 - 22:03:11]
other one um so I honestly don't rarely

[22:03:08 - 22:03:12]
I rarely ever use these apis directly

[22:03:11 - 22:03:15]
but I'm sure we can figure it out so

[22:03:12 - 22:03:19]
let's go jump into it uh do we have to

[22:03:15 - 22:03:21]
sign up to utilize this let's go over to

[22:03:19 - 22:03:23]
pricing I mean there's a free tier so

[22:03:21 - 22:03:25]
let's go ahead and sign up and I'm going

[22:03:23 - 22:03:26]
just connect with my GitHub account here

[22:03:25 - 22:03:28]
actually I'm going to connect with

[22:03:26 - 22:03:30]
Google because it'll be

[22:03:28 - 22:03:32]
easier github's going to make it a lot

[22:03:30 - 22:03:34]
more work for me here today and let's

[22:03:32 - 22:03:36]
see if we can go utilize their API so we

[22:03:34 - 22:03:39]
successfully signed in with Google free

[22:03:36 - 22:03:41]
plan includes 100 searches per month

[22:03:39 - 22:03:43]
non-commercial use only uh for free

[22:03:41 - 22:03:45]
plans you need to verify your account

[22:03:43 - 22:03:47]
check your inbox and verify your email

[22:03:45 - 22:03:49]
verify your phone

[22:03:47 - 22:03:51]
number okay so I'm going to go ahead and

[22:03:49 - 22:03:52]
do that so I'll be back in just a moment

[22:03:51 - 22:03:55]
all right so I've confirmed both we're

[22:03:52 - 22:03:56]
going to go ahead and hit subscribe now

[22:03:55 - 22:03:59]
and so that should bring us into here

[22:03:56 - 22:04:01]
and so we have our account there's a

[22:03:59 - 22:04:04]
very old photo of me but that's totally

[22:04:01 - 22:04:06]
okay and wow oh wow is there a lot of

[22:04:04 - 22:04:08]
documentation but um I already have an

[22:04:06 - 22:04:10]
environment uh or developer environment

[22:04:08 - 22:04:12]
open here in GitHub

[22:04:10 - 22:04:13]
GitHub code spaces for our gen

[22:04:12 - 22:04:17]
Essentials I'm going to make a new

[22:04:13 - 22:04:20]
folder here called Ser

[22:04:17 - 22:04:23]
API and I'm going to just continue on

[22:04:20 - 22:04:25]
with using uh iron

[22:04:23 - 22:04:29]
python

[22:04:25 - 22:04:32]
ipnb okay and so we should I no that's

[22:04:29 - 22:04:37]
not right it's IP

[22:04:32 - 22:04:40]
ipy iron python Jupiter notebook the Y

[22:04:37 - 22:04:45]
is for Jupiter which is to me silly um

[22:04:40 - 22:04:46]
so we have an API key here um I need to

[22:04:45 - 22:04:48]
learn how to start working this we'll

[22:04:46 - 22:04:49]
take take a look at the playground I'm

[22:04:48 - 22:04:51]
not sure if there's anything interesting

[22:04:49 - 22:04:54]
here I mean that's kind of cool uh but

[22:04:51 - 22:04:58]
what I want to find out is how to

[22:04:54 - 22:05:02]
programmatically work with this

[22:04:58 - 22:05:02]
so where is the Sur API

[22:05:05 - 22:05:08]
SDK okay so here's an

[22:05:08 - 22:05:14]
example

[22:05:10 - 22:05:15]
um so it seems like that's a ruby

[22:05:14 - 22:05:17]
example I love Ruby but uh let's go

[22:05:15 - 22:05:20]
switch over to

[22:05:17 - 22:05:24]
Python and so here we go all right

[22:05:20 - 22:05:27]
so we will go close this out that's my

[22:05:24 - 22:05:32]
personal email uh we'll go

[22:05:27 - 22:05:37]
and add Ser so say pip install

[22:05:32 - 22:05:39]
Sur API and then we'll also get python.

[22:05:37 - 22:05:42]
EnV so we'll

[22:05:39 - 22:05:42]
grab both of those

[22:05:43 - 22:05:48]
there

[22:05:44 - 22:05:51]
and then we have some stuff down

[22:05:48 - 22:05:54]
below and we'll add this

[22:05:51 - 22:05:56]
here and I mean is that my API key if

[22:05:54 - 22:05:59]
that is it's really silly that they did

[22:05:56 - 22:06:03]
that um we'll go back to my

[22:05:59 - 22:06:05]
counts and this is my API key

[22:06:03 - 22:06:07]
here oh yeah they put it right in there

[22:06:05 - 22:06:09]
that's a very weird interface we'll go

[22:06:07 - 22:06:13]
ahead and we'll just place it in here

[22:06:09 - 22:06:16]
and I will also make a example file

[22:06:13 - 22:06:18]
here and it's not like I can hide my key

[22:06:16 - 22:06:20]
like it's they don't make that easy

[22:06:18 - 22:06:24]
there but we'll go ahead and say get

[22:06:20 - 22:06:28]
ignore and we're going to ignore the EnV

[22:06:24 - 22:06:32]
here um so we have an API key I'm just

[22:06:28 - 22:06:34]
going to call this uh ser

[22:06:32 - 22:06:37]
Ser API

[22:06:34 - 22:06:39]
key okay and then we'll go over here

[22:06:37 - 22:06:42]
we'll go back to this example I'm going

[22:06:39 - 22:06:44]
to grab this on out here and I'll paste

[22:06:42 - 22:06:47]
it into here and then we'll go back over

[22:06:44 - 22:06:50]
to here I'll need to import

[22:06:47 - 22:06:51]
um a few things we'll go over to

[22:06:50 - 22:06:53]
streamlet here I always pull that

[22:06:51 - 22:06:54]
because it's at the bottom we'll grab

[22:06:53 - 22:06:57]
these three lines here we'll go back

[22:06:54 - 22:07:03]
over to this example we'll go down a

[22:06:57 - 22:07:06]
line and we'll load in ourv file here um

[22:07:03 - 22:07:06]
I'm not sure why this is an

[22:07:06 - 22:07:11]
issue cannot import I'll bring this down

[22:07:10 - 22:07:13]
a line so that just doesn't conflict

[22:07:11 - 22:07:15]
with what we're doing I'm going to run

[22:07:13 - 22:07:15]
this

[22:07:16 - 22:07:21]
again from Ser API import that well

[22:07:19 - 22:07:24]
that's what the library is

[22:07:21 - 22:07:26]
called okay well let's go maybe it's not

[22:07:24 - 22:07:28]
called that Ser API python maybe that's

[22:07:26 - 22:07:31]
not the name of the

[22:07:28 - 22:07:34]
library they didn't particularly tell us

[22:07:31 - 22:07:37]
what the the name of the library

[22:07:34 - 22:07:40]
was okay but how do we install it okay

[22:07:37 - 22:07:44]
so the actual one's called this

[22:07:40 - 22:07:46]
interesting so we go back over to here

[22:07:44 - 22:07:49]
and then we'll paste this in here as

[22:07:46 - 22:07:50]
such and we will then install the Google

[22:07:49 - 22:07:54]
search results that way then we'll run

[22:07:50 - 22:07:54]
this one then we'll run this

[22:07:55 - 22:07:59]
one no no that should not be an issue

[22:07:58 - 22:08:02]
now I'm going to go ahead and give this

[22:07:59 - 22:08:04]
a restart maybe this requires hard

[22:08:02 - 22:08:05]
restart and then we'll load this in here

[22:08:04 - 22:08:08]
and then we'll load this in here there

[22:08:05 - 22:08:11]
we go now we have a non-issue um and so

[22:08:08 - 22:08:15]
then we'll grab this I'm just say os. n

[22:08:11 - 22:08:19]
byron. getet and this will be uh what do

[22:08:15 - 22:08:19]
we call this Ser API

[22:08:20 - 22:08:24]
key and so this is literally just

[22:08:22 - 22:08:26]
searching out to

[22:08:24 - 22:08:32]
Google and we'll go down here and then

[22:08:26 - 22:08:32]
we'll print results AI overview

[22:08:39 - 22:08:44]
um okay well whatever the results were

[22:08:41 - 22:08:46]
let's go ahead and just print

[22:08:44 - 22:08:48]
them I'm going to do this in a separate

[22:08:46 - 22:08:49]
one just so that I'm not calling it a

[22:08:48 - 22:08:52]
bunch of

[22:08:49 - 22:08:54]
times and let's just print it here and

[22:08:52 - 22:08:57]
so you can see we

[22:08:54 - 22:09:02]
have some kind of

[22:08:57 - 22:09:05]
results this is uh not easy to read

[22:09:02 - 22:09:09]
pretty print

[22:09:05 - 22:09:12]
Json python because I I can't read

[22:09:09 - 22:09:12]
this

[22:09:16 - 22:09:24]
um I suppose we could just dump the file

[22:09:20 - 22:09:24]
too let's go take a look at

[22:09:26 - 22:09:33]
that that

[22:09:29 - 22:09:33]
work yeah

[22:09:33 - 22:09:36]
import

[22:09:37 - 22:09:41]
Json we go and then we'll go down to

[22:09:39 - 22:09:44]
here and then we'll run this and so now

[22:09:41 - 22:09:45]
we're starting to see our results okay

[22:09:44 - 22:09:47]
so what do we have we have search

[22:09:45 - 22:09:50]
metadata results search

[22:09:47 - 22:09:54]
parameters search

[22:09:50 - 22:09:57]
information ads um this is not very

[22:09:54 - 22:09:58]
useful to me so I'm not exactly sure

[22:09:57 - 22:10:00]
what we're expected to do with this but

[22:09:58 - 22:10:02]
let's go back here and see if there are

[22:10:00 - 22:10:03]
better examples

[22:10:02 - 22:10:07]
so yeah we have Google search API over

[22:10:03 - 22:10:07]
here search query that's

[22:10:08 - 22:10:12]
fine

[22:10:10 - 22:10:14]
um so here they're showing the example

[22:10:12 - 22:10:18]
of oh what's being returned back okay

[22:10:14 - 22:10:18]
great so

[22:10:18 - 22:10:23]
here we have a bunch of stuff and so I

[22:10:21 - 22:10:25]
guess it's like what are we looking for

[22:10:23 - 22:10:28]
so if we go here we have local results

[22:10:25 - 22:10:30]
related questions organic search organic

[22:10:28 - 22:10:31]
results so maybe we're interested in

[22:10:30 - 22:10:36]
organic results results if that even

[22:10:31 - 22:10:36]
shows up and so we'll go back over to

[22:10:37 - 22:10:40]
[Music]

[22:10:42 - 22:10:48]
here why doesn't that

[22:10:45 - 22:10:50]
match search information oh it's right

[22:10:48 - 22:10:52]
here organic results States results for

[22:10:50 - 22:10:53]
exact results for exact spelling no

[22:10:52 - 22:10:55]
that's still not very

[22:10:53 - 22:10:58]
useful let's go take a look at what they

[22:10:55 - 22:11:00]
thought we were going to get

[22:10:58 - 22:11:01]
back well this one's a little bit more

[22:11:00 - 22:11:03]
different right this this one's

[22:11:01 - 22:11:05]
searching coffee and this one's

[22:11:03 - 22:11:07]
specifically looking at the organic

[22:11:05 - 22:11:08]
results in here but if we go back over

[22:11:07 - 22:11:12]
to

[22:11:08 - 22:11:14]
here we just have search. get

[22:11:12 - 22:11:15]
dictionary so I'm going to go ahead and

[22:11:14 - 22:11:17]
grab this code

[22:11:15 - 22:11:19]
here and let's see if we can get a

[22:11:17 - 22:11:22]
better

[22:11:19 - 22:11:25]
result okay and so I want to grab

[22:11:22 - 22:11:27]
this and here we're specifically

[22:11:25 - 22:11:29]
specifying the engine to be Google

[22:11:27 - 22:11:31]
search which maybe that will get us

[22:11:29 - 22:11:35]
better results I'm not sure those lines

[22:11:31 - 22:11:37]
are still the same um and I'm going to

[22:11:35 - 22:11:40]
go down here and just print this out

[22:11:37 - 22:11:40]
like this we'll go ahead and run

[22:11:40 - 22:11:45]
that it's going out and

[22:11:43 - 22:11:47]
searching and then we'll come back here

[22:11:45 - 22:11:51]
run this and so now we are getting the

[22:11:47 - 22:11:52]
organic results back okay so now that is

[22:11:51 - 22:11:54]
a lot more useful in terms of

[22:11:52 - 22:11:56]
information I'm kind of curious like how

[22:11:54 - 22:11:58]
would it go and get stuff from a very

[22:11:56 - 22:11:59]
specific website because when we were

[22:11:58 - 22:12:02]
doing

[22:11:59 - 22:12:05]
um uh a last CLC search it was using Ser

[22:12:02 - 22:12:09]
API I believe and I'm not sure how it

[22:12:05 - 22:12:09]
was crawling specific contents of a

[22:12:11 - 22:12:16]
website but you can see there's a lot of

[22:12:14 - 22:12:18]
stuff in

[22:12:16 - 22:12:20]
here I mean this must be old there's no

[22:12:18 - 22:12:23]
way you can get Twitter information now

[22:12:20 - 22:12:23]
but clearly at one point you

[22:12:25 - 22:12:31]
could yeah it seems like this allows

[22:12:28 - 22:12:33]
for a lot of different stuff inline

[22:12:31 - 22:12:36]
images buying

[22:12:33 - 22:12:36]
guide

[22:12:38 - 22:12:42]
um but I guess if there's like a website

[22:12:40 - 22:12:44]
maybe they have like a cache version of

[22:12:42 - 22:12:46]
the website that you follow through well

[22:12:44 - 22:12:48]
you do have links right so I guess what

[22:12:46 - 22:12:49]
you would do is that you would just use

[22:12:48 - 22:12:52]
something like if it was Ruby use

[22:12:49 - 22:12:54]
something like noiri but you use um XML

[22:12:52 - 22:12:56]
or HTML parser and then you would just

[22:12:54 - 22:12:59]
follow the link and then parse those

[22:12:56 - 22:13:02]
pages but this is giving you um uh a way

[22:12:59 - 22:13:04]
to explore those pages from there um so

[22:13:02 - 22:13:06]
I mean that's

[22:13:04 - 22:13:09]
something um what I would probably want

[22:13:06 - 22:13:12]
to do is look up a grammar rule so let's

[22:13:09 - 22:13:12]
say I was trying to learn what NOA was

[22:13:12 - 22:13:18]
so I'm going to try to switch my

[22:13:12 - 22:13:19]
keyboard over here so there is a no ha

[22:13:18 - 22:13:21]
and I probably would actually search

[22:13:19 - 22:13:23]
bunpro and so that would probably be my

[22:13:21 - 22:13:25]
results I go bunpro like

[22:13:23 - 22:13:27]
this I'm trying to make like a real

[22:13:25 - 22:13:31]
example that I would

[22:13:27 - 22:13:31]
use bun Pro

[22:13:33 - 22:13:38]
and then I would go back over to

[22:13:36 - 22:13:41]
here and I would replace this in my

[22:13:38 - 22:13:43]
query like

[22:13:41 - 22:13:45]
this and then I would run

[22:13:43 - 22:13:48]
this I want to see the organic search

[22:13:45 - 22:13:51]
results and so now I'm starting to get

[22:13:48 - 22:13:52]
it and here we can see we have a link uh

[22:13:51 - 22:13:54]
and the first position is correct like

[22:13:52 - 22:13:57]
that's what I want and so I might add

[22:13:54 - 22:14:01]
another one here and so in this I want

[22:13:57 - 22:14:01]
the actual link

[22:14:05 - 22:14:10]
okay and I'm not sure what we' use for

[22:14:08 - 22:14:12]
pythons so I'm going to go over to

[22:14:10 - 22:14:14]
Claude just because again I'm paying for

[22:14:12 - 22:14:18]
it you probably see me using open AI

[22:14:14 - 22:14:20]
more than Claude but uh using python I

[22:14:18 - 22:14:23]
have a link of a

[22:14:20 - 22:14:28]
website and I need to

[22:14:23 - 22:14:31]
scrape uh the text uh but also clean

[22:14:28 - 22:14:32]
out all the uh HTML I know there's like

[22:14:31 - 22:14:35]
a cleaning library in Python I can't

[22:14:32 - 22:14:38]
remember what it's called um

[22:14:35 - 22:14:40]
but oh yeah we could use beautiful soup

[22:14:38 - 22:14:40]
to do it that's

[22:14:41 - 22:14:48]
right beautiful soup is like the noiri

[22:14:44 - 22:14:48]
of of python

[22:14:50 - 22:14:55]
um yeah okay we'll give it a go um it

[22:14:53 - 22:14:56]
probably has something built in to be

[22:14:55 - 22:14:58]
able to scrape it out so maybe that's

[22:14:56 - 22:15:01]
what it's doing so I'm going to go here

[22:14:58 - 22:15:04]
and make a new link and we will go ahead

[22:15:01 - 22:15:06]
and do pip install request and beautiful

[22:15:04 - 22:15:08]
soup 4 I guess it's version four that

[22:15:06 - 22:15:11]
we're on right now that was a really

[22:15:08 - 22:15:14]
fast run this use no takes forever um

[22:15:11 - 22:15:16]
and so here we have an example of text

[22:15:14 - 22:15:18]
so I'm going to go ahead and grab this

[22:15:16 - 22:15:20]
here and

[22:15:18 - 22:15:22]
so this

[22:15:20 - 22:15:24]
defines that we'll bring this on to the

[22:15:22 - 22:15:27]
next line

[22:15:24 - 22:15:31]
here okay so I'm just hoping that this

[22:15:27 - 22:15:32]
works remove script and style not not

[22:15:31 - 22:15:34]
exactly what I meant clean the text okay

[22:15:32 - 22:15:37]
so maybe that that that's what cleans it

[22:15:34 - 22:15:40]
right there um but what I want is the

[22:15:37 - 22:15:42]
link from the first result so we have

[22:15:40 - 22:15:46]
organic search and so maybe we do zero

[22:15:42 - 22:15:49]
and then link so here I'm thinking what

[22:15:46 - 22:15:51]
we do is we paste this in as such and

[22:15:49 - 22:15:52]
then we do Square Braes here and then we

[22:15:51 - 22:15:54]
do

[22:15:52 - 22:15:56]
zero and then we'll see if we can scrape

[22:15:54 - 22:15:59]
the content from here oh we got the

[22:15:56 - 22:16:01]
content back cool okay so now we have

[22:15:59 - 22:16:04]
this grammar rule all the information

[22:16:01 - 22:16:06]
about this grammar Rule and so now what

[22:16:04 - 22:16:08]
I can do is I can bring in an

[22:16:06 - 22:16:11]
llm right and then I can tell it like

[22:16:08 - 22:16:14]
hey help me learn this grammar rule or

[22:16:11 - 22:16:16]
even maybe what I can do is say extract

[22:16:14 - 22:16:17]
out from this the grammar examples

[22:16:16 - 22:16:23]
because if we were to follow this link

[22:16:17 - 22:16:25]
here like we go back and say uh NOA Boon

[22:16:23 - 22:16:27]
Pro uh that's not the example but here

[22:16:25 - 22:16:28]
like here's kind of the one that I was

[22:16:27 - 22:16:31]
looking for

[22:16:28 - 22:16:33]
NOA or Noah Noah I'm saying NOA it's no

[22:16:31 - 22:16:34]
W but we'll go back and turn back on my

[22:16:33 - 22:16:38]
Japanese keyboard here so I can type it

[22:16:34 - 22:16:41]
in but we say no

[22:16:38 - 22:16:44]
h it's not probably H I'm just saying it

[22:16:41 - 22:16:47]
like that weird way um but we go here

[22:16:44 - 22:16:48]
and this is like a jlp N5 it's like

[22:16:47 - 22:16:51]
beginner level stuff and in here they

[22:16:48 - 22:16:56]
have examples right so maybe I want to

[22:16:51 - 22:16:59]
extract out um the examples here right

[22:16:56 - 22:17:01]
um and so we have the text the body text

[22:16:59 - 22:17:03]
and now I want to feed it over to llm

[22:17:01 - 22:17:05]
and I know that we've done an example

[22:17:03 - 22:17:09]
with a few different ones and so maybe

[22:17:05 - 22:17:10]
I'd like to go use a um Co just because

[22:17:09 - 22:17:12]
I'm already using it I'm going to

[22:17:10 - 22:17:15]
probably go use anthropic and so in

[22:17:12 - 22:17:18]
anthropic we do have a basic example

[22:17:15 - 22:17:21]
here and so I'm going to go ahead and do

[22:17:18 - 22:17:23]
this I don't need um python Dev so I'm

[22:17:21 - 22:17:26]
just going to grab anthropic here and

[22:17:23 - 22:17:30]
I'm going to go on the next

[22:17:26 - 22:17:30]
line and

[22:17:30 - 22:17:34]
probably have to reload. EnV here but

[22:17:32 - 22:17:36]
I'm going to go ahead here and paste

[22:17:34 - 22:17:39]
this in and what I want to do is I want

[22:17:36 - 22:17:41]
to say

[22:17:39 - 22:17:47]
um please

[22:17:41 - 22:17:47]
extract out the example Japanese

[22:17:50 - 22:17:58]
sentences and provide

[22:17:53 - 22:18:00]
them in a bullet list just the okay so

[22:17:58 - 22:18:04]
that's what I wanted to do

[22:18:00 - 22:18:04]
from this

[22:18:04 - 22:18:10]
text and I need to do interpolation so

[22:18:07 - 22:18:12]
I'm going to do curly here and this will

[22:18:10 - 22:18:13]
be clean text I think that was called up

[22:18:12 - 22:18:15]
here

[22:18:13 - 22:18:16]
yeah and then I think I have to put an F

[22:18:15 - 22:18:19]
in front of this for it to be

[22:18:16 - 22:18:21]
interpreted correctly and so this should

[22:18:19 - 22:18:22]
be what we need I do need a key in here

[22:18:21 - 22:18:25]
so I'm going to go back up to the

[22:18:22 - 22:18:28]
anthropic example and copy this and go

[22:18:25 - 22:18:30]
down to here and I'm going to go here

[22:18:28 - 22:18:32]
onto the next line obviously if we want

[22:18:30 - 22:18:34]
to do this we do this one as well I'm

[22:18:32 - 22:18:37]
going to go back over to

[22:18:34 - 22:18:37]
anthropic

[22:18:37 - 22:18:42]
API I think I loaded up some money on

[22:18:40 - 22:18:44]
this yeah because what we found out was

[22:18:42 - 22:18:46]
that anthropic even though it says has a

[22:18:44 - 22:18:48]
free tier I could not find it um it is

[22:18:46 - 22:18:50]
gone so we're going to go over to my API

[22:18:48 - 22:18:53]
Keys here um I'm going to create a new

[22:18:50 - 22:18:56]
API key this will just be for

[22:18:53 - 22:18:58]
Ser I'm going to add this

[22:18:56 - 22:19:00]
key so now I have this key I'm going to

[22:18:58 - 22:19:03]
go back over to here I'm going to paste

[22:19:00 - 22:19:05]
it into here as such and so now I have

[22:19:03 - 22:19:06]
myself a key you're not going to be able

[22:19:05 - 22:19:08]
to do this unless you have a paid

[22:19:06 - 22:19:10]
version of anthropic if you don't and

[22:19:08 - 22:19:13]
you use open AI free one if you don't go

[22:19:10 - 22:19:14]
use coh here I have code around here you

[22:19:13 - 22:19:16]
can adapt it we have them over here we

[22:19:14 - 22:19:19]
have a coh here example we have an we

[22:19:16 - 22:19:22]
have an open AI example um I'm going to

[22:19:19 - 22:19:24]
reload the EMV file here um I don't

[22:19:22 - 22:19:26]
think I ran this I'm going to go run

[22:19:24 - 22:19:29]
this oh no no we're in the wrong thing

[22:19:26 - 22:19:32]
okay so I'm over here so I ran that I

[22:19:29 - 22:19:35]
need to re load mymv

[22:19:32 - 22:19:37]
file which is up here and then we can go

[22:19:35 - 22:19:39]
all the way down to the ground and so

[22:19:37 - 22:19:42]
hopefully this just

[22:19:39 - 22:19:43]
works I'm going to just separate this

[22:19:42 - 22:19:45]
out just so I'm not making multiple

[22:19:43 - 22:19:49]
calls to the

[22:19:45 - 22:19:51]
API um but I'm going to go ahead and run

[22:19:49 - 22:19:51]
this

[22:19:51 - 22:19:55]
here and we'll give it a moment here we

[22:19:53 - 22:19:56]
probably could to use tyu for this hiu

[22:19:55 - 22:19:59]
would be good for extraction here are

[22:19:56 - 22:20:03]
the example texts that are listed here

[22:19:59 - 22:20:06]
um and so so if we look at

[22:20:03 - 22:20:08]
this uh was that atarashi

[22:20:06 - 22:20:11]
NOA

[22:20:08 - 22:20:14]
no I'm not sure what that character is

[22:20:11 - 22:20:17]
we'll go back over here and take a look

[22:20:14 - 22:20:25]
and see if it did a good job so this was

[22:20:17 - 22:20:27]
here atarashi no oh k k no kurum so that

[22:20:25 - 22:20:30]
was the first one does that match it

[22:20:27 - 22:20:32]
does okay so basically achieved EX what

[22:20:30 - 22:20:35]
I wanted to do and so that's how you

[22:20:32 - 22:20:37]
would integrate Ser as a full example so

[22:20:35 - 22:20:39]
this one is completely done I'm going to

[22:20:37 - 22:20:41]
make sure I'm G to make sure that I

[22:20:39 - 22:20:44]
clear out my key because I don't want

[22:20:41 - 22:20:47]
any of you folks stealing my data my my

[22:20:44 - 22:20:48]
free free or not free but my my credits

[22:20:47 - 22:20:51]
there and anyway we're going to go ahead

[22:20:48 - 22:20:53]
here and grab this and I'm going to go

[22:20:51 - 22:20:55]
ahead and show Sur API example and so

[22:20:53 - 22:20:58]
now we have an example of how to work

[22:20:55 - 22:21:00]
with Ser so there you go um and actually

[22:20:58 - 22:21:03]
before I go I'm going to see if I can

[22:21:00 - 22:21:03]
get rid of my Ser

[22:21:04 - 22:21:11]
key I'm going to delete my c key there

[22:21:07 - 22:21:13]
we go it's deleted and oh no that's

[22:21:11 - 22:21:14]
copied I thought I deleted it and I'm

[22:21:13 - 22:21:15]
going to regenerate the key so I'm going

[22:21:14 - 22:21:16]
to do that off screen but we're going to

[22:21:15 - 22:21:18]
call this Den I'll see you in the next

[22:21:16 - 22:21:21]
one okay

[22:21:18 - 22:21:24]

[22:21:21 - 22:21:26]
ciao so our friend George who's really

[22:21:24 - 22:21:27]
good at building out agentic workflows

[22:21:26 - 22:21:30]
was telling me about all hands which is

[22:21:27 - 22:21:33]
an open source project I believe

[22:21:30 - 22:21:36]
that is by I thought it was by GitHub

[22:21:33 - 22:21:37]
but maybe it's just on GitHub um so yeah

[22:21:36 - 22:21:41]
I'm not sure I'm familiar with the

[22:21:37 - 22:21:43]
company per se but this project started

[22:21:41 - 22:21:46]
as open Devon and now it's been renamed

[22:21:43 - 22:21:50]
to um open hands if you've heard of

[22:21:46 - 22:21:53]
Devon that is a agentic um coding agent

[22:21:50 - 22:21:55]
that will uh write code for you and so

[22:21:53 - 22:21:57]
open Devon is the Open Source One of it

[22:21:55 - 22:21:59]
and they renamed it to Open Hands um so

[22:21:57 - 22:22:00]
I have seen this in the past but it's

[22:21:59 - 22:22:02]
been a while since I used it and so

[22:22:00 - 22:22:04]
might be fun to give this a go it looks

[22:22:02 - 22:22:06]
like we can run this in a Docker

[22:22:04 - 22:22:07]
container and so if we are going to do

[22:22:06 - 22:22:10]
that I think this is where I'm going to

[22:22:07 - 22:22:12]
use my Intel machine uh if you can run

[22:22:10 - 22:22:14]
Docker containers on your on your local

[22:22:12 - 22:22:15]
machine then go ahead and do that last

[22:22:14 - 22:22:18]
time I tried this in a video it was

[22:22:15 - 22:22:21]
failing because this machine is very old

[22:22:18 - 22:22:23]
um not my Intel machine but this uh this

[22:22:21 - 22:22:25]
my big recording machine here is so I'm

[22:22:23 - 22:22:27]
going to go ahead and open up a remote

[22:22:25 - 22:22:30]
desktop connection as I have it on my

[22:22:27 - 22:22:31]
network this other machine I believe

[22:22:30 - 22:22:32]
that it's still still turned on so we'll

[22:22:31 - 22:22:34]
go ahead and try to connect to

[22:22:32 - 22:22:37]
it

[22:22:34 - 22:22:40]
okay say

[22:22:37 - 22:22:42]
yes and here we go so as you can see I

[22:22:40 - 22:22:44]
was trying to do something earlier here

[22:22:42 - 22:22:46]
that failed uh I think I was trying to

[22:22:44 - 22:22:49]
use VM and that was like super hard to

[22:22:46 - 22:22:51]
use unbelievably difficult to use um at

[22:22:49 - 22:22:53]
least in that take that I was taking it

[22:22:51 - 22:22:56]
let's go look for uh I think it was

[22:22:53 - 22:22:56]
called Open Hands Open

[22:22:56 - 22:23:01]
Hands by All Hands yep

[22:23:00 - 22:23:03]
and so they're suggesting that we can

[22:23:01 - 22:23:05]
start working with this by running a

[22:23:03 - 22:23:07]
container I'm not sure how large this

[22:23:05 - 22:23:09]
container is so hopefully it is not

[22:23:07 - 22:23:14]
super large but we'll go ahead and we

[22:23:09 - 22:23:14]
will open up um Visual Studio

[22:23:14 - 22:23:19]
code okay I'm going to go ahead and run

[22:23:16 - 22:23:19]
new

[22:23:21 - 22:23:24]
terminal and I'm just going to CD into

[22:23:23 - 22:23:25]
my sites directory we're not doing

[22:23:24 - 22:23:27]
anything insights but I want to make

[22:23:25 - 22:23:28]
sure that I have Docker installed if you

[22:23:27 - 22:23:30]
don't have Docker installed we have a

[22:23:28 - 22:23:31]
tutorial on that setting up your Dev

[22:23:30 - 22:23:33]
fire

[22:23:31 - 22:23:35]
um and so follow instructions there

[22:23:33 - 22:23:36]
let's go ahead whoops I did not mean to

[22:23:35 - 22:23:39]
split that uh side by side but actually

[22:23:36 - 22:23:42]
that might work perfectly for me here um

[22:23:39 - 22:23:46]
and so I want to First pull the

[22:23:42 - 22:23:46]
container so go ahead and do

[22:23:47 - 22:23:53]
that and we will just wait for that to

[22:23:50 - 22:23:54]
pull okay all right so we've pulled the

[22:23:53 - 22:23:56]
image and now the next question is can

[22:23:54 - 22:23:59]
we run it so I'm just carefully looking

[22:23:56 - 22:24:01]
here if we need um anything additional

[22:23:59 - 22:24:05]
it doesn't appear that we

[22:24:01 - 22:24:06]
do it's a lot of lines here but let's

[22:24:05 - 22:24:09]
hope that this just works we'll go ahead

[22:24:06 - 22:24:09]
and hit

[22:24:09 - 22:24:13]
enter and we'll give it a moment one

[22:24:12 - 22:24:15]
thing it is saying is that we'll need a

[22:24:13 - 22:24:17]
model provider and API key such as

[22:24:15 - 22:24:18]
Claude Sonet um and I mean that's

[22:24:17 - 22:24:21]
something that we could probably try to

[22:24:18 - 22:24:21]
get set

[22:24:22 - 22:24:27]
up so we will see what configuration has

[22:24:26 - 22:24:28]
I wonder if we have to we can configure

[22:24:27 - 22:24:31]
that through ads that would be the

[22:24:28 - 22:24:32]
easiest way to do it but I imagine it

[22:24:31 - 22:24:35]
wants an API key

[22:24:32 - 22:24:36]
directly so that is something let's go

[22:24:35 - 22:24:38]
take a look at at that while that is

[22:24:36 - 22:24:42]
going here

[22:24:38 - 22:24:42]
oops and we'll just expand this

[22:24:42 - 22:24:47]
here so let's see what options we do

[22:24:47 - 22:24:52]
have I mean the easiest for me to hook

[22:24:49 - 22:24:54]
up would be GP uh GPT 40 and so I might

[22:24:52 - 22:24:54]
just do

[22:24:58 - 22:25:03]
that but yeah we'll have to wait for it

[22:25:00 - 22:25:04]
to get running here first seems like

[22:25:03 - 22:25:06]
it's pulling another image so maybe

[22:25:04 - 22:25:08]
there's something else that needed says

[22:25:06 - 22:25:10]
it's now running on Port 3000 so we'll

[22:25:08 - 22:25:12]
go take a look we'll give it a moment

[22:25:10 - 22:25:12]
here to get

[22:25:14 - 22:25:17]
started and we are in here so now we

[22:25:16 - 22:25:19]
have some options I'm going to go with

[22:25:17 - 22:25:21]
open AI again you can choose whatever

[22:25:19 - 22:25:22]
you want looks like we can put in Azure

[22:25:21 - 22:25:25]
but that's going to be the same thing as

[22:25:22 - 22:25:28]
open AI I'm going to choose GPT

[22:25:25 - 22:25:30]
40 and now I'll go get an API key so

[22:25:28 - 22:25:34]
that again is just easy for me to get so

[22:25:30 - 22:25:37]
we'll go to open

[22:25:34 - 22:25:39]
Ai and I'm just doing this off screen

[22:25:37 - 22:25:44]
here

[22:25:39 - 22:25:46]
okay uh we'll say let's drop down

[22:25:44 - 22:25:48]
research there we go I'm not sure why

[22:25:46 - 22:25:52]
they uh have all that animation there

[22:25:48 - 22:25:53]
for their their stuff and I'm going to

[22:25:52 - 22:25:54]
go here I'm going to create a new

[22:25:53 - 22:25:56]
project this one's going to be called

[22:25:54 - 22:25:56]
open

[22:25:57 - 22:26:01]
hands and then we will go into manage

[22:26:00 - 22:26:03]
projects and then from here we'll go to

[22:26:01 - 22:26:05]
API keys I'm going to create a new API

[22:26:03 - 22:26:07]
key this will be open hands I'm going to

[22:26:05 - 22:26:09]
select the project here as open hands

[22:26:07 - 22:26:11]
I'm going to create the key I'm going to

[22:26:09 - 22:26:13]
copy the key I'm going to go back over

[22:26:11 - 22:26:15]
here I'm going to paste in the

[22:26:13 - 22:26:16]
key so now we have the key I'm going to

[22:26:15 - 22:26:19]
go ahead and hit

[22:26:16 - 22:26:22]
save uh we use tools to understand how

[22:26:19 - 22:26:25]
applications uh how our application is

[22:26:22 - 22:26:26]
used sure that's totally fine I don't

[22:26:25 - 22:26:28]
need to save the password that is fine

[22:26:26 - 22:26:30]
there so now we're in here and saying

[22:26:28 - 22:26:33]
what do you want to build and so

[22:26:30 - 22:26:34]
understand that we are using open AI um

[22:26:33 - 22:26:36]
but we can plug in whatever we want we

[22:26:34 - 22:26:39]
could also import stuff I wonder if we

[22:26:36 - 22:26:43]
could use an open source

[22:26:39 - 22:26:43]
model it says llama

[22:26:43 - 22:26:49]
3.1 so that would be kind of interesting

[22:26:45 - 22:26:49]
if we could plug in a local open source

[22:26:52 - 22:26:57]
model

[22:26:54 - 22:26:58]
um I mean if it's open AI compatible I

[22:26:57 - 22:27:02]
bet you could yeah so you could probably

[22:26:58 - 22:27:05]
use a maybe there's also open

[22:27:02 - 22:27:08]
router so I'm not sure but we will just

[22:27:05 - 22:27:14]
use uh the API for now and I'll just say

[22:27:08 - 22:27:17]
you know I want to build a game of uh

[22:27:14 - 22:27:19]
zorc okay so now it opens this this

[22:27:17 - 22:27:19]
really interesting

[22:27:20 - 22:27:24]
interface and so we are just waiting for

[22:27:22 - 22:27:27]
it to do something so say waiting for

[22:27:24 - 22:27:27]
the client to become

[22:27:27 - 22:27:31]
ready I've never used this before so I'm

[22:27:29 - 22:27:35]
not sure what experience is going to be

[22:27:31 - 22:27:35]
like so the agent is now running the

[22:27:38 - 22:27:42]
task

[22:27:40 - 22:27:44]
okay design the game choose a

[22:27:42 - 22:27:46]
programming language set the developer

[22:27:44 - 22:27:48]
environment uh develop the game if you

[22:27:46 - 22:27:49]
need help for the specific Parts process

[22:27:48 - 22:27:51]
such as setting up the development

[22:27:49 - 22:27:52]
environment coding a particular feature

[22:27:51 - 22:27:55]
feel free to

[22:27:52 - 22:27:58]
ask uh okay so we'll download the

[22:27:55 - 22:28:02]
files um I guess we'll just make a new

[22:27:58 - 22:28:05]
folder here and we'll call this uh new

[22:28:02 - 22:28:08]
game and we'll select this folder we'll

[22:28:05 - 22:28:09]
say View files save changes and so I

[22:28:08 - 22:28:12]
imagine that the idea is that we need to

[22:28:09 - 22:28:13]
open up that workspace here so I'm just

[22:28:12 - 22:28:15]
carefully looking I'm not sure what

[22:28:13 - 22:28:18]
these buttons

[22:28:15 - 22:28:21]
[Music]

[22:28:18 - 22:28:21]
do

[22:28:21 - 22:28:26]
okay what if I click

[22:28:24 - 22:28:29]
this I'm not sure what that button

[22:28:26 - 22:28:30]
does I'm just trying to open them up

[22:28:29 - 22:28:32]
here right so let's say open

[22:28:30 - 22:28:34]
code

[22:28:32 - 22:28:37]
yes and what I go

[22:28:34 - 22:28:40]
file open

[22:28:37 - 22:28:40]
folder I think it was

[22:28:43 - 22:28:47]
documents okay so my question is like

[22:28:46 - 22:28:48]
all right we have this open but how do

[22:28:47 - 22:28:51]
we start working with the code here so

[22:28:48 - 22:28:52]
give me just a moment okay all right so

[22:28:51 - 22:28:53]
I mean here they're just suggesting to

[22:28:52 - 22:28:55]
do something really simple but they're

[22:28:53 - 22:28:57]
not really explaining as to how we can

[22:28:55 - 22:28:58]
go ahead and do that so I'm going to go

[22:28:57 - 22:28:59]
ahead I'm just going to write this line

[22:28:58 - 22:29:01]
here which is please write me a Bas

[22:28:59 - 22:29:03]
script I'm expecting there to be files

[22:29:01 - 22:29:05]
oh here we go so here's a file I'm not

[22:29:03 - 22:29:09]
sure why this one was so uh so much more

[22:29:05 - 22:29:13]
complicated but now we have our hello.sh

[22:29:09 - 22:29:16]
file uh so C can you can you run the

[22:29:13 - 22:29:18]
hello.sh let's see if we can do

[22:29:16 - 22:29:21]
that look at that so the idea is that it

[22:29:18 - 22:29:22]
has the ability to write code it also

[22:29:21 - 22:29:24]
has the ability to execute code which I

[22:29:22 - 22:29:26]
think is really interesting um looks

[22:29:24 - 22:29:30]
like we could also um have a duper

[22:29:26 - 22:29:33]
notebook so let say can you make a

[22:29:30 - 22:29:33]
simple Jupiter

[22:29:36 - 22:29:46]
notebook to uh use Bert to do

[22:29:42 - 22:29:46]
classification let's see if we can do

[22:29:52 - 22:29:58]
that we'll just give it a moment

[22:29:56 - 22:30:02]
there okay and so it's telling us some

[22:29:58 - 22:30:02]
things it can do so

[22:30:08 - 22:30:11]
continue all right but the thing is I

[22:30:10 - 22:30:13]
what I wanted to do is I actually wanted

[22:30:11 - 22:30:15]
to create the files oh it did there it

[22:30:13 - 22:30:19]
is okay great and so now if I go over to

[22:30:15 - 22:30:19]
here why can't I see it over here

[22:30:22 - 22:30:25]
though well at least we have the file

[22:30:24 - 22:30:27]
here so that's fine if we go over to

[22:30:25 - 22:30:31]
here we can see it over here as

[22:30:27 - 22:30:32]
well so I can say yes

[22:30:31 - 22:30:35]
and now I'm somewhere completely else

[22:30:32 - 22:30:39]
let's try this again open code there we

[22:30:35 - 22:30:39]
go and so it has written one for

[22:30:39 - 22:30:46]
us can you

[22:30:43 - 22:30:49]
execute the uh The

[22:30:46 - 22:30:51]
Notebook make sure it's

[22:30:49 - 22:30:52]
working not exactly what I meant to

[22:30:51 - 22:30:55]
write but the question is would it be

[22:30:52 - 22:30:57]
able to execute

[22:30:55 - 22:31:01]
it so supposedly it is running the

[22:30:57 - 22:31:01]
command oh over okay over here

[22:31:04 - 22:31:08]
and I mean we obviously wouldn't see it

[22:31:06 - 22:31:09]
here but it clearly is executing so it's

[22:31:08 - 22:31:12]
opening the notebook and then it's

[22:31:09 - 22:31:14]
trying to execute and see what

[22:31:12 - 22:31:16]
happens while that's happening let's

[22:31:14 - 22:31:20]
read through it so it installs

[22:31:16 - 22:31:23]
torch um it brings in Bert uncased we

[22:31:20 - 22:31:24]
have a simple data set so yeah it should

[22:31:23 - 22:31:26]
be pretty simple and easy for this to

[22:31:24 - 22:31:27]
run on my machine so I'm going to just

[22:31:26 - 22:31:29]
pause and I'm going to see if it

[22:31:27 - 22:31:30]
actually works all right so it said it

[22:31:29 - 22:31:32]
ran the jupyter command now it's running

[22:31:30 - 22:31:34]
it again I'm not sure as to why it's

[22:31:32 - 22:31:36]
doing it twice here have execution time

[22:31:34 - 22:31:38]
out Jupiter current working space is

[22:31:36 - 22:31:41]
this and so it might be attempting it

[22:31:38 - 22:31:43]
more than once to make this work um and

[22:31:41 - 22:31:44]
here we can see that it did time out I

[22:31:43 - 22:31:46]
don't want it to do it multiple times so

[22:31:44 - 22:31:48]
I'm just going to hit stop but you get

[22:31:46 - 22:31:51]
kind of the idea of what it can do here

[22:31:48 - 22:31:56]
so we can go and say uh can you make my

[22:31:51 - 22:31:56]
bash script into a simple

[22:31:56 - 22:32:01]
game let's see if we can do that

[22:32:03 - 22:32:06]
great and so it says that script can

[22:32:05 - 22:32:09]
generate a random number between one to

[22:32:06 - 22:32:09]
10 so let's see if it does

[22:32:15 - 22:32:19]
that obviously you can also work with

[22:32:17 - 22:32:21]
browser files that's kind of

[22:32:19 - 22:32:23]
interesting we'll give it some time here

[22:32:21 - 22:32:25]
to generate all right so it comes back

[22:32:23 - 22:32:26]
here and it says transform your bass

[22:32:25 - 22:32:27]
script we can create a text based

[22:32:26 - 22:32:30]
Adventure

[22:32:27 - 22:32:31]
game I'll create it in the B script I'm

[22:32:30 - 22:32:33]
not sure why it's saying the jupyter

[22:32:31 - 22:32:35]
notebook as we were not suggesting for

[22:32:33 - 22:32:37]
it to do that the hript has been

[22:32:35 - 22:32:38]
transformed into the simple number

[22:32:37 - 22:32:39]
guessing game you can use the script of

[22:32:38 - 22:32:42]
the following command so if we go back

[22:32:39 - 22:32:44]
over to here uh it does not look like

[22:32:42 - 22:32:46]
it's been

[22:32:44 - 22:32:48]
transformed okay and so you know this

[22:32:46 - 22:32:50]
thing isn't exactly perfect oh maybe we

[22:32:48 - 22:32:52]
have to continue to do this this we

[22:32:50 - 22:32:52]
start the

[22:32:54 - 22:32:58]
game so yeah I'm not exactly sure how to

[22:32:56 - 22:33:00]
get this to work but it is cool that

[22:32:58 - 22:33:02]
it's available Maybe we use a different

[22:33:00 - 22:33:05]
model like uh Claude Sonet 3.5 would

[22:33:02 - 22:33:06]
perform a lot better I'm not certain um

[22:33:05 - 22:33:07]
it's kind of a pain for me to switch out

[22:33:06 - 22:33:09]
my keys right now so it's not something

[22:33:07 - 22:33:12]
I'm going to do we do have some other

[22:33:09 - 22:33:13]
Advanced options and so it looks like we

[22:33:12 - 22:33:16]
can switch out the agent so right now we

[22:33:13 - 22:33:17]
have a Kodak agent but there are other

[22:33:16 - 22:33:19]
ones here I don't know much about these

[22:33:17 - 22:33:21]
other agents but it is uh interesting

[22:33:19 - 22:33:24]
that we can do this so that's all I

[22:33:21 - 22:33:26]
really wanted to show you um that you

[22:33:24 - 22:33:27]
know there are open source projects and

[22:33:26 - 22:33:28]
you know you have to play around with

[22:33:27 - 22:33:32]
this to see what the results are but you

[22:33:28 - 22:33:33]
can uh see all the code right and if you

[22:33:32 - 22:33:36]
wanted to modify your own and make your

[22:33:33 - 22:33:39]
own that would be really cool

[22:33:36 - 22:33:41]
[Music]

[22:33:39 - 22:33:43]
okay hey this is Andrew Brown in this

[22:33:41 - 22:33:46]
video I want to show you crew AI which

[22:33:43 - 22:33:49]
allows you to build AI agents so it is

[22:33:46 - 22:33:51]
an opinionated framework um I George our

[22:33:49 - 22:33:54]
friend showed us it uh over at stack

[22:33:51 - 22:33:57]
pack um and so wow is this thing

[22:33:54 - 22:33:59]
powerful but when I tried it last time

[22:33:57 - 22:34:00]
uh the library wasn't pulling and so I'm

[22:33:59 - 22:34:02]
hoping that this time around we're going

[22:34:00 - 22:34:05]
to have a a bit better luck so I'm going

[22:34:02 - 22:34:07]
to go over to my GitHub J AI Essentials

[22:34:05 - 22:34:08]
and if I already have a GitHub uh Cod

[22:34:07 - 22:34:10]
space running I'm going to go ahead and

[22:34:08 - 22:34:12]
utilize that as you see with a lot of

[22:34:10 - 22:34:14]
these open source or sorry uh serverless

[22:34:12 - 22:34:16]
things we don't need a lot of compute um

[22:34:14 - 22:34:19]
so things have been uh pretty easy so

[22:34:16 - 22:34:20]
far but I'm going to go ahead and uh

[22:34:19 - 22:34:22]
this I think again this environment is

[22:34:20 - 22:34:23]
already running from last time you seen

[22:34:22 - 22:34:25]
me launch these environments hundreds of

[22:34:23 - 22:34:27]
time so I don't think I need to show you

[22:34:25 - 22:34:28]
that and these are old keys so I'm not

[22:34:27 - 22:34:32]
really worried about it but I'm going to

[22:34:28 - 22:34:33]
make a new folder here called crew Ai

[22:34:32 - 22:34:36]
and we're going to go ahead and start

[22:34:33 - 22:34:38]
working with this if we can get it to uh

[22:34:36 - 22:34:40]
install properly so I'm going to go over

[22:34:38 - 22:34:42]
to here to crew aai and they should have

[22:34:40 - 22:34:44]
a lot of cool examples that we can

[22:34:42 - 22:34:48]
utilize so I'm going to go here into

[22:34:44 - 22:34:49]
examples um not exactly what I wanted I

[22:34:48 - 22:34:54]
know they have a ton of

[22:34:49 - 22:34:56]
examples how to nope tools nope where

[22:34:54 - 22:34:58]
did I see this before let's go back over

[22:34:56 - 22:35:00]
to

[22:34:58 - 22:35:02]
here and go to

[22:35:00 - 22:35:04]
examples ah they have a completely

[22:35:02 - 22:35:05]
different repo for it and so here we

[22:35:04 - 22:35:07]
have our examples I'm going to press

[22:35:05 - 22:35:10]
period on my keyboard to open up

[22:35:07 - 22:35:10]
github.com

[22:35:30 - 22:35:34]
download this one here so I'm going to

[22:35:31 - 22:35:37]
go ahead and download it and I'm just

[22:35:34 - 22:35:39]
downloading it to my desktop in a folder

[22:35:37 - 22:35:41]
so just give me a moment here it went to

[22:35:39 - 22:35:43]
Quest UI I'm not sure what what quest UI

[22:35:41 - 22:35:44]
was but I'm going to download into there

[22:35:43 - 22:35:47]
and then once that's downloaded I'm

[22:35:44 - 22:35:49]
going to bring it over into here into

[22:35:47 - 22:35:53]
this folder here so give me a moment as

[22:35:49 - 22:35:55]
I'm looking for uh this Quest youi

[22:35:53 - 22:35:56]
directory not sure why it's called that

[22:35:55 - 22:35:58]
but I believe it's downloaded so I'm

[22:35:56 - 22:36:02]
going to go ahead into this crew AI

[22:35:58 - 22:36:06]
directory and Dr drag it in right if you

[22:36:02 - 22:36:08]
are uh using my repo then you can just

[22:36:06 - 22:36:11]
open it up and so they're talking about

[22:36:08 - 22:36:14]
how this might work um there is a Pi

[22:36:11 - 22:36:16]
Project tomel in here that shows some

[22:36:14 - 22:36:19]
configuration I believe that this is

[22:36:16 - 22:36:24]
utilized does this use um poetry I found

[22:36:19 - 22:36:27]
out there's a thing called poetry for um

[22:36:24 - 22:36:30]
Python and it sounds like it's supposed

[22:36:27 - 22:36:34]
to be uh basically bundler for

[22:36:30 - 22:36:37]
um python right so poad whatever

[22:36:34 - 22:36:39]
whatever so similar to pip but more like

[22:36:37 - 22:36:40]
whatever that is yeah there's a there's

[22:36:39 - 22:36:44]
a poetry lock file this is totally

[22:36:40 - 22:36:47]
totally like um just like uh uh what do

[22:36:44 - 22:36:50]
you call it um bundler so maybe I should

[22:36:47 - 22:36:52]
like uh crew AI if that's what it is or

[22:36:50 - 22:36:54]
sorry not crew AI but poetry we'll go

[22:36:52 - 22:36:56]
ahead here and I don't think poetry is

[22:36:54 - 22:36:57]
installed yeah there's no way that that

[22:36:56 - 22:37:00]
would be installed especially if I spell

[22:36:57 - 22:37:03]
it wrong it's not going to work poet

[22:37:00 - 22:37:04]
no so I'm going to do a pip install

[22:37:03 - 22:37:06]
poetry I'm going to assume that's how we

[22:37:04 - 22:37:09]
install it

[22:37:06 - 22:37:11]
right I haven't used it before well

[22:37:09 - 22:37:12]
sorry I've seen it before but when I did

[22:37:11 - 22:37:14]
this last time it didn't work as

[22:37:12 - 22:37:17]
expected I'm going to do a poetry

[22:37:14 - 22:37:19]
install and see if that

[22:37:17 - 22:37:20]
works and it's saying doesn't find it

[22:37:19 - 22:37:22]
because we're in the wrong directory and

[22:37:20 - 22:37:24]
so we'll CD into it okay so we'll go

[22:37:22 - 22:37:26]
ahead and do a PO install and here it

[22:37:24 - 22:37:28]
says the current activated python

[22:37:26 - 22:37:30]
version 312 is not supported by the

[22:37:28 - 22:37:32]
project so it wants a version of 310 and

[22:37:30 - 22:37:34]
We've ran into this issue before this is

[22:37:32 - 22:37:36]
where we'll need to create a new

[22:37:34 - 22:37:40]
environment do we have cond installed ah

[22:37:36 - 22:37:43]
we do excellent and so I believe we have

[22:37:40 - 22:37:45]
in here in our local Dev environment

[22:37:43 - 22:37:48]
instructions on how to set up a new

[22:37:45 - 22:37:51]
python environment so let's go ahead and

[22:37:48 - 22:37:51]
read through

[22:37:55 - 22:38:00]
that create a new environment here we go

[22:37:58 - 22:38:02]
so let's go ahead we'll do to create

[22:38:00 - 22:38:05]
hyphen hyen name this one's going to be

[22:38:02 - 22:38:08]
called crew AI I guess crew AI um and

[22:38:05 - 22:38:11]
we'll say python version

[22:38:08 - 22:38:14]
3.1.0 hyphen y we'll go ahead install

[22:38:11 - 22:38:17]
that and so this will be our workaround

[22:38:14 - 22:38:20]
uh for us here once this is all set up

[22:38:17 - 22:38:22]
so we now have uh that set up we'll say

[22:38:20 - 22:38:25]
cond

[22:38:22 - 22:38:26]
activate uh crew AI so we'll activate

[22:38:25 - 22:38:30]
that

[22:38:26 - 22:38:32]
there um cond nit before cond activate

[22:38:30 - 22:38:33]
Okay cond and it did we not I guess we'd

[22:38:32 - 22:38:37]
have to do that for the first time

[22:38:33 - 22:38:37]
that's fine kond cre

[22:38:38 - 22:38:43]
activate

[22:38:39 - 22:38:45]
Okay but we did do that right I'm going

[22:38:43 - 22:38:47]
to try this again maybe it didn't create

[22:38:45 - 22:38:48]
it all I'm thinking is that maybe didn't

[22:38:47 - 22:38:50]
create it because we didn't do the condo

[22:38:48 - 22:38:53]
knit that's something that I didn't

[22:38:50 - 22:38:54]
expect that we'd have to do because um

[22:38:53 - 22:38:55]
um I I just honestly thought we wouldn't

[22:38:54 - 22:38:57]
have to do that but if we didn't have to

[22:38:55 - 22:38:59]
do that we'll do that again it's still

[22:38:57 - 22:39:02]
complaining about this let's try cond KN

[22:38:59 - 22:39:05]
off all maybe that's what it wants there

[22:39:02 - 22:39:07]
we go and now we'll try this I'm going

[22:39:05 - 22:39:09]
to close the shell out I'm going to make

[22:39:07 - 22:39:12]
a new shell here and then close this one

[22:39:09 - 22:39:13]
out I'll try this again so now we're

[22:39:12 - 22:39:15]
seeing it so it is definitely

[22:39:13 - 22:39:17]
initialized and so maybe that was just a

[22:39:15 - 22:39:20]
little bit of the problem there um we'll

[22:39:17 - 22:39:22]
go into game builder and I'll say cond

[22:39:20 - 22:39:25]
activate crew

[22:39:22 - 22:39:27]
AI there we

[22:39:25 - 22:39:30]
go stopping starting sometimes just

[22:39:27 - 22:39:32]
fixes things for us so now we'll do a

[22:39:30 - 22:39:34]
pip install

[22:39:32 - 22:39:37]
poetry I'm just going based on my

[22:39:34 - 22:39:39]
bundler information from uh Ruby so

[22:39:37 - 22:39:41]
hopefully that works and so that is

[22:39:39 - 22:39:42]
going through there now we'll do poetry

[22:39:41 - 22:39:45]
and

[22:39:42 - 22:39:48]
install and we'll go ahead and install

[22:39:45 - 22:39:51]
that so there says the Pi Pi Project

[22:39:48 - 22:39:53]
tomel has significantly uh has changed

[22:39:51 - 22:39:56]
significantly since po lock was

[22:39:53 - 22:40:00]
generated um run to fix the lock file

[22:39:56 - 22:40:04]
okay let's do that poetry lock

[22:40:00 - 22:40:04]
I'm not sure did it install the

[22:40:04 - 22:40:10]
dependencies i h no update I mean I I

[22:40:08 - 22:40:13]
want to use whatever is in the lock file

[22:40:10 - 22:40:15]
right but I'm not that familiar with

[22:40:13 - 22:40:18]
this tool so I'm surprised it's running

[22:40:15 - 22:40:20]
that it's just giving me red text I'm

[22:40:18 - 22:40:21]
like is that a bad thing I don't know so

[22:40:20 - 22:40:22]
we'll wait for this to do whatever it

[22:40:21 - 22:40:25]
needs to do and then we'll see what

[22:40:22 - 22:40:27]
happens all right so it looks like yeah

[22:40:25 - 22:40:31]
that resolved and so maybe this time I

[22:40:27 - 22:40:33]
have crew aai installed correctly um so

[22:40:31 - 22:40:36]
I'm going to do here is let's take a

[22:40:33 - 22:40:37]
look at um well we do have a EnV example

[22:40:36 - 22:40:38]
that we have to configure so I'm going

[22:40:37 - 22:40:39]
to assume that we're going to have to

[22:40:38 - 22:40:42]
make that so I'm going to go ahead and

[22:40:39 - 22:40:47]
do exe EMV make sure that file is

[22:40:42 - 22:40:49]
ignored it is and luckily I use open AI

[22:40:47 - 22:40:51]
constantly so this is going to be easy

[22:40:49 - 22:40:55]
for US Open

[22:40:51 - 22:40:59]
AI really hate where this

[22:40:55 - 22:41:01]
is it's like so slow loading too

[22:40:59 - 22:41:02]
um and I have a basic project in here

[22:41:01 - 22:41:04]
that I just keep using and so I'm going

[22:41:02 - 22:41:06]
to go into that if you don't have it

[22:41:04 - 22:41:08]
create your project we're going to go to

[22:41:06 - 22:41:10]
API keys I have a key from earlier I'm

[22:41:08 - 22:41:12]
going to revoke that key I'm going to

[22:41:10 - 22:41:15]
create a new key I'm going to call this

[22:41:12 - 22:41:17]
uh crew Ai and we'll go

[22:41:15 - 22:41:19]
ahead and we will select basic and we'll

[22:41:17 - 22:41:20]
create that and now we have a key we're

[22:41:19 - 22:41:24]
going to copy that we're going to make

[22:41:20 - 22:41:26]
our way back over to here um and I'll

[22:41:24 - 22:41:30]
paste that in here so now we have this

[22:41:26 - 22:41:33]
open AI key here right so that's good

[22:41:30 - 22:41:36]
um so what I'm thinking about

[22:41:33 - 22:41:37]
is so that's configured that's good but

[22:41:36 - 22:41:39]
let's go take a look at our source code

[22:41:37 - 22:41:41]
so we understand so we have a

[22:41:39 - 22:41:43]
main.py right and this is going to load

[22:41:41 - 22:41:46]
in the game crew Builder which is

[22:41:43 - 22:41:49]
another file over

[22:41:46 - 22:41:52]
here okay and we'll talk about this file

[22:41:49 - 22:41:54]
in a second but here we are loading in

[22:41:52 - 22:41:55]
the game design configuration yamel file

[22:41:54 - 22:41:57]
from over

[22:41:55 - 22:42:00]
here

[22:41:57 - 22:42:02]
okay and if you can tell it's kind of it

[22:42:00 - 22:42:04]
basically is a prompt it's telling you

[22:42:02 - 22:42:06]
how this game works all the core game

[22:42:04 - 22:42:09]
mechanics uh that the agent has to

[22:42:06 - 22:42:12]
follow right and we actually have three

[22:42:09 - 22:42:14]
different game examples here okay so

[22:42:12 - 22:42:16]
coming back over to our

[22:42:14 - 22:42:18]
main.py we can see that the input of

[22:42:16 - 22:42:21]
this game here is snake so it's going to

[22:42:18 - 22:42:24]
run the snake game and then it's saying

[22:42:21 - 22:42:26]
get the crew kick it off and provided

[22:42:24 - 22:42:28]
the inputs and here are the results then

[22:42:26 - 22:42:29]
we have down below here an example so

[22:42:28 - 22:42:32]
train the crew for given number of uh

[22:42:29 - 22:42:33]
interactions so it's going through here

[22:42:32 - 22:42:35]
and this is specifically for Pac-Man

[22:42:33 - 22:42:37]
okay so we have run and we have train

[22:42:35 - 22:42:39]
which are two different things we're

[22:42:37 - 22:42:41]
going to go over here to the actual game

[22:42:39 - 22:42:43]
uh game builder crew and it's importing

[22:42:41 - 22:42:45]
agent crew process tasks so I assume

[22:42:43 - 22:42:47]
that these are components of crew AI

[22:42:45 - 22:42:48]
that we have to work with and what I

[22:42:47 - 22:42:50]
think is really interesting is that it

[22:42:48 - 22:42:53]
defines a senior engineer agent a

[22:42:50 - 22:42:56]
quality assurance engineer agent a chief

[22:42:53 - 22:42:58]
qaa engineer agent and then we have our

[22:42:56 - 22:43:00]
code task that we want them to perform a

[22:42:58 - 22:43:02]
revieww task and evaluate task and then

[22:43:00 - 22:43:04]
the crew itself we go over to task. yaml

[22:43:02 - 22:43:06]
this isn't this isn't explicitly get

[22:43:04 - 22:43:07]
loaded anywhere so I think it's

[22:43:06 - 22:43:09]
implicitly being loaded and we're

[22:43:07 - 22:43:11]
describing specific tasks that it's

[22:43:09 - 22:43:13]
supposed to do so you will create a game

[22:43:11 - 22:43:15]
using python uh these are the

[22:43:13 - 22:43:17]
instructions right your final answer

[22:43:15 - 22:43:19]
must be the full python code then we

[22:43:17 - 22:43:20]
have a review task so you will create a

[22:43:19 - 22:43:23]
game using python these are your

[22:43:20 - 22:43:25]
instructions using the code you got

[22:43:23 - 22:43:26]
check for errors so this is the one

[22:43:25 - 22:43:27]
that's reviewing it then we have an

[22:43:26 - 22:43:29]
evaluation task you're helping create a

[22:43:27 - 22:43:32]
game using python you'll look over the

[22:43:29 - 22:43:33]
code ensure that it it is is complete

[22:43:32 - 22:43:36]
and does the job that it's supposed to

[22:43:33 - 22:43:38]
do so that kind of correlates I believe

[22:43:36 - 22:43:40]
with our three agents right and their

[22:43:38 - 22:43:42]
goals that they need to achieve so

[22:43:40 - 22:43:44]
that's really really interesting so

[22:43:42 - 22:43:45]
let's go ahead and figure out how to run

[22:43:44 - 22:43:48]
this

[22:43:45 - 22:43:50]
um so if we go to the read me does it

[22:43:48 - 22:43:53]
tell us was there a read me in

[22:43:50 - 22:43:56]
here did we get a read me we do okay

[22:43:53 - 22:43:58]
great and so we'll go over to here so

[22:43:56 - 22:44:00]
this one says it's using gp40 which is

[22:43:58 - 22:44:02]
fine that's what I like it to use this

[22:44:00 - 22:44:04]
will use the GT40 unless you change it

[22:44:02 - 22:44:06]
to a different model which is totally

[22:44:04 - 22:44:07]
fine um you may incur cost I'm using a

[22:44:06 - 22:44:09]
paid version of it if you're using the

[22:44:07 - 22:44:12]
free version this might fail I don't

[22:44:09 - 22:44:13]
know so we did poetry install which is

[22:44:12 - 22:44:15]
fine we didn't do poetry lock poetry

[22:44:13 - 22:44:18]
install but we did poetry

[22:44:15 - 22:44:21]
install um we can modify the agents or

[22:44:18 - 22:44:22]
tasks if we want to run it's poetry Run

[22:44:21 - 22:44:25]
game

[22:44:22 - 22:44:29]
builder uh game builder

[22:44:25 - 22:44:30]
crew okay I did not know that could also

[22:44:29 - 22:44:33]
be utilized well I guess that makes

[22:44:30 - 22:44:34]
sense CU like if I was doing bundler I

[22:44:33 - 22:44:36]
would run in the context of bundler

[22:44:34 - 22:44:38]
right so i' do bundle exact Ruby

[22:44:36 - 22:44:40]
whatever whatever and so this is a

[22:44:38 - 22:44:43]
library and so it knows that it can run

[22:44:40 - 22:44:44]
that mod or Library module there so

[22:44:43 - 22:44:45]
we'll go ahead and do this and we'll see

[22:44:44 - 22:44:47]
what

[22:44:45 - 22:44:49]
happens if it works that'd be really

[22:44:47 - 22:44:51]
cool says there's no module named game

[22:44:49 - 22:44:53]
builder crew I think it's because we are

[22:44:51 - 22:44:57]
in the game builder directory I wonder

[22:44:53 - 22:45:00]
if that's messing us up

[22:44:57 - 22:45:02]
H I'm not sure

[22:45:00 - 22:45:03]
maybe if we go back at directory let's

[22:45:02 - 22:45:05]
see what happens what if we do it here

[22:45:03 - 22:45:09]
like

[22:45:05 - 22:45:11]
this could not find Project toml okay so

[22:45:09 - 22:45:15]
that's not helping it

[22:45:11 - 22:45:15]
out oops no no we're still in

[22:45:16 - 22:45:21]
there

[22:45:18 - 22:45:23]
okay is there like a file missing from

[22:45:21 - 22:45:24]
this we have the nitpy right so that's

[22:45:23 - 22:45:27]
what it needs to know that it is a

[22:45:24 - 22:45:30]
library maybe we need a CD into the

[22:45:27 - 22:45:32]
source directory

[22:45:30 - 22:45:34]
but then why is the EnV out here then

[22:45:32 - 22:45:34]
how would it load

[22:45:37 - 22:45:42]
it

[22:45:39 - 22:45:43]
okay so game builder crew is the entry

[22:45:42 - 22:45:46]
point defined in the project tomel but

[22:45:43 - 22:45:46]
it's not installed as a

[22:45:47 - 22:45:52]
script so I'm going to CD back a

[22:45:49 - 22:45:52]
directory

[22:45:54 - 22:45:59]
here okay so now it's not saying that it

[22:45:57 - 22:46:01]
doesn't exist oh it says no module name

[22:45:59 - 22:46:02]
called game builder crew so let's

[22:46:01 - 22:46:04]
carefully read this then so game builder

[22:46:02 - 22:46:06]
crew is an entry point defined in the Pi

[22:46:04 - 22:46:06]
Project

[22:46:08 - 22:46:12]
tunel

[22:46:10 - 22:46:16]
yes well first of all what's a pi tomel

[22:46:12 - 22:46:16]
P project tomel Pi Project

[22:46:24 - 22:46:30]
tomel the CES the build system

[22:46:26 - 22:46:30]
requirements for p python projects

[22:46:32 - 22:46:36]
okay let me go back over to here for

[22:46:35 - 22:46:37]
those that know what they're doing

[22:46:36 - 22:46:39]
they're probably like Andrew this is so

[22:46:37 - 22:46:41]
easy why are you getting so confused let

[22:46:39 - 22:46:45]
me just read this a little bit

[22:46:41 - 22:46:46]
here um let just give me a second okay

[22:46:45 - 22:46:48]
okay here it's suggesting I need to do

[22:46:46 - 22:46:51]
po reinstall I mean we already did it

[22:46:48 - 22:46:51]
but let's do it again I

[22:46:52 - 22:46:56]
guess oh maybe because we resolved the

[22:46:55 - 22:46:58]
lock file that it actually never

[22:46:56 - 22:46:59]
installed anything okay that's probably

[22:46:58 - 22:47:02]
what

[22:46:59 - 22:47:04]
happened I see so now we're actually

[22:47:02 - 22:47:06]
installing things for real and this

[22:47:04 - 22:47:07]
looks a lot like Ruby this is totally a

[22:47:06 - 22:47:09]
ruby

[22:47:07 - 22:47:10]
experience all right so that's now

[22:47:09 - 22:47:13]
installed let's go take a look and see

[22:47:10 - 22:47:16]
if we can get this

[22:47:13 - 22:47:18]
running and it's going out to I assume

[22:47:16 - 22:47:21]
chat

[22:47:18 - 22:47:24]
gbt what do we have so

[22:47:21 - 22:47:27]
far so the objective of the

[22:47:24 - 22:47:29]
game okay so we have the agent you will

[22:47:27 - 22:47:32]
create the task so we have the task okay

[22:47:29 - 22:47:32]
that makes sense we'll go down

[22:47:32 - 22:47:36]
below I assume what it's doing is it's

[22:47:34 - 22:47:39]
just working so we'll just wait there we

[22:47:36 - 22:47:39]
go so came

[22:47:40 - 22:47:44]
back with the code so now we're getting

[22:47:43 - 22:47:47]
code

[22:47:44 - 22:47:50]
back final answer okay so now it's

[22:47:47 - 22:47:50]
produced the final answer for

[22:47:51 - 22:47:55]
us so now it's going through the

[22:47:53 - 22:47:58]
software quality control engineer this

[22:47:55 - 22:47:59]
is really interesting because um this is

[22:47:58 - 22:48:00]
not out yet but but in the boot camp we

[22:47:59 - 22:48:02]
we code something and we're not

[22:48:00 - 22:48:05]
necessarily using an agent but we are

[22:48:02 - 22:48:07]
using um we're reading this by hand and

[22:48:05 - 22:48:09]
I like how this process is very similar

[22:48:07 - 22:48:10]
so that's really interesting so now we

[22:48:09 - 22:48:11]
have the software quality control

[22:48:10 - 22:48:14]
engineer it looks like it's producing

[22:48:11 - 22:48:18]
its own code

[22:48:14 - 22:48:21]
okay and then we have the third agent

[22:48:18 - 22:48:21]
running

[22:48:23 - 22:48:29]
okay

[22:48:26 - 22:48:31]
cool and so here's the result okay so

[22:48:29 - 22:48:33]
now we can go ahead here final code for

[22:48:31 - 22:48:36]
the game I can assume that this works

[22:48:33 - 22:48:38]
because otherwise how would it not if um

[22:48:36 - 22:48:40]
it have it as an example we'll go ahead

[22:48:38 - 22:48:41]
and copy that and I'm going to make the

[22:48:40 - 22:48:43]
new game here let be

[22:48:41 - 22:48:46]
snake

[22:48:43 - 22:48:50]
P go ahead and paste it

[22:48:46 - 22:48:52]
in and so now we have our game here I'm

[22:48:50 - 22:48:54]
not sure what this utilizes uses Pi game

[22:48:52 - 22:48:57]
um I'm not sure if I can run this

[22:48:54 - 22:49:01]
on my on this

[22:48:57 - 22:49:04]
environment cuz I think this has a UI

[22:49:01 - 22:49:06]
right so I'm not sure if I could

[22:49:04 - 22:49:08]
actually run it here I I'll try but I'm

[22:49:06 - 22:49:10]
not I don't think it will work here um

[22:49:08 - 22:49:14]
so we'll do

[22:49:10 - 22:49:19]
python python um snake.

[22:49:14 - 22:49:19]
py well do pip install P

[22:49:20 - 22:49:25]
game pip install P game my typing get a

[22:49:23 - 22:49:27]
little bit off my office is really cold

[22:49:25 - 22:49:28]
because it's winter right now um but

[22:49:27 - 22:49:31]
we'll go ahead and try this I really

[22:49:28 - 22:49:33]
don't expect this to work

[22:49:31 - 22:49:35]
here yeah because this would only work

[22:49:33 - 22:49:37]
on a local machine so what I'll do is

[22:49:35 - 22:49:39]
I'll download this

[22:49:37 - 22:49:42]
file this looks successful so I'm going

[22:49:39 - 22:49:46]
to go ahead and copy what I can

[22:49:42 - 22:49:50]
here so go ahead here and just say

[22:49:46 - 22:49:52]
save um but what I want to do is I want

[22:49:50 - 22:49:54]
to open up visual studio code locally

[22:49:52 - 22:49:57]
here we go and I'm just going to load in

[22:49:54 - 22:49:58]
this single file here so I'm in the Gen

[22:49:57 - 22:50:01]
Essentials here this actually is the

[22:49:58 - 22:50:01]
same cor so I could just pull

[22:50:06 - 22:50:11]
it okay so we're just pulling the latest

[22:50:09 - 22:50:12]
code and now I'm in my local developer

[22:50:11 - 22:50:14]
environment

[22:50:12 - 22:50:16]
obviously um and then I'm going to CD

[22:50:14 - 22:50:19]
into crew

[22:50:16 - 22:50:21]
Ai and into the game crew

[22:50:19 - 22:50:22]
Builder and I'm going to do I'm going to

[22:50:21 - 22:50:24]
do pip

[22:50:22 - 22:50:28]
install P game because I think that's

[22:50:24 - 22:50:28]
the only thing we need to run this

[22:50:31 - 22:50:34]
okay and so that's going to

[22:50:37 - 22:50:44]
install and now what I'm going to do is

[22:50:40 - 22:50:47]
go ahead and run this we'll say um

[22:50:44 - 22:50:47]
python

[22:50:47 - 22:50:54]
snake.

[22:50:50 - 22:50:57]
um no it's just python maybe Python 3

[22:50:54 - 22:50:57]
st.

[22:50:58 - 22:51:02]
and so what I'm expecting is it to

[22:51:00 - 22:51:06]
launch some kind of

[22:51:02 - 22:51:08]
interface but right now we are in uh WSL

[22:51:06 - 22:51:10]
so that might not

[22:51:08 - 22:51:11]
work now that I'm thinking about it I'm

[22:51:10 - 22:51:14]
not sure how would that how would that

[22:51:11 - 22:51:15]
work here it wouldn't so it is running

[22:51:14 - 22:51:17]
but I don't think it has any way for us

[22:51:15 - 22:51:21]
to see it so actually I'm going to have

[22:51:17 - 22:51:23]
to go over to um terminal here now I'm

[22:51:21 - 22:51:25]
on Windows

[22:51:23 - 22:51:26]
Windows I have command prompt on this

[22:51:25 - 22:51:29]
machine

[22:51:26 - 22:51:33]
here uh do I have python

[22:51:29 - 22:51:36]
installed okay so we'll type exit and um

[22:51:33 - 22:51:38]
I'm going to CD into this directory here

[22:51:36 - 22:51:40]
and then we're going to go into J

[22:51:38 - 22:51:41]
Essentials and then we're going to go

[22:51:40 - 22:51:43]
into crew

[22:51:41 - 22:51:45]
AI if you can't get this to run it's

[22:51:43 - 22:51:46]
totally fine like it's a lot of work to

[22:51:45 - 22:51:48]
do this if you're on a Mac this would be

[22:51:46 - 22:51:52]
a lot easier obviously but um I'm going

[22:51:48 - 22:51:55]
to go ahead here and let's do

[22:51:52 - 22:51:58]
di um so I'm going to do python or we'll

[22:51:55 - 22:52:00]
do pip install pip install P game so

[22:51:58 - 22:52:01]
we'll install it now now it's installing

[22:52:00 - 22:52:03]
on my windows side of my machine not

[22:52:01 - 22:52:05]
within WSL because this needs a way of

[22:52:03 - 22:52:09]
launching and it needs some kind of

[22:52:05 - 22:52:11]
interface that Taps into the uh Windows

[22:52:09 - 22:52:12]
um API this should work on Mac by the

[22:52:11 - 22:52:15]
way if you're on a Mac on on Linux I

[22:52:12 - 22:52:17]
have no idea um so we'll go ahead and

[22:52:15 - 22:52:20]
we'll run this so we'll say uh

[22:52:17 - 22:52:22]
python uh

[22:52:20 - 22:52:24]
snakey so now it should open up and

[22:52:22 - 22:52:27]
there we go so we have our

[22:52:24 - 22:52:30]
game and it

[22:52:27 - 22:52:30]
works cool

[22:52:40 - 22:52:43]
Co all right I'm sure you don't want to

[22:52:42 - 22:52:46]
watch me play this all day but let's go

[22:52:43 - 22:52:48]
back to the source code in the browser

[22:52:46 - 22:52:50]
here and

[22:52:48 - 22:52:54]
so we saw that there were two different

[22:52:50 - 22:52:56]
ones here we had in the

[22:52:54 - 22:53:00]
instructions um not instructions but in

[22:52:56 - 22:53:00]
our code example

[22:53:02 - 22:53:06]
we have one that's train and there's one

[22:53:04 - 22:53:06]
that's

[22:53:06 - 22:53:11]
run so notice that this one says train

[22:53:09 - 22:53:13]
and so this allows it to go through

[22:53:11 - 22:53:15]
multiple iterations and um I can't

[22:53:13 - 22:53:17]
remember the term for it what's it

[22:53:15 - 22:53:18]
called it's a reinforcement learning

[22:53:17 - 22:53:20]
this is reinforcement learning and so

[22:53:18 - 22:53:21]
that's really interesting to me that we

[22:53:20 - 22:53:23]
can go through that and so I guess the

[22:53:21 - 22:53:25]
idea is that it would continuously

[22:53:23 - 22:53:27]
produce the code that produces the best

[22:53:25 - 22:53:29]
outcome um and so I mean we're not going

[22:53:27 - 22:53:31]
to run that here to day cuz I don't want

[22:53:29 - 22:53:33]
to use up a bunch of my um compute or my

[22:53:31 - 22:53:34]
sorry my API credits because I'm not

[22:53:33 - 22:53:36]
sure how much it would utilize but this

[22:53:34 - 22:53:38]
is just one example and so we are

[22:53:36 - 22:53:40]
obviously looking at the uh coding

[22:53:38 - 22:53:42]
example for a game but you could apply

[22:53:40 - 22:53:44]
this to anything and yeah it's just that

[22:53:42 - 22:53:45]
it gives you the boilerplate code to do

[22:53:44 - 22:53:48]
it and so this is something that's super

[22:53:45 - 22:53:49]
powerful and really awesome um I don't

[22:53:48 - 22:53:52]
know why I don't use it more be because

[22:53:49 - 22:53:53]
I know about it but uh anyway there you

[22:53:52 - 22:53:56]
go and so we will see you in the next

[22:53:53 - 22:53:56]
one okay ciao

### 8. @sonnymckelvey5938 (üëç 23)
I just started looking at the AI Toolkit for VS Code. I really like that you have access to all of the models listed as well as models pulled from Ollama. All of the different things that going on in GenAI are happening very quickly and it is very difficult to decide on and follow a course of action, especially for someone fairly new to the field. At the moment I have no idea what the future for an 80 year old Python programmer holds, but I do find LLMs rather fascinating especially in RAG environments.
