## 説明

What happens when we have very little time to build something and the next person has to guess what it is? Then the next person has to build what that person's guess is, and so on. By the end, will it be anything close to the original? Let's find out!

[00:00 - 00:03]
Welcome back everybody. Another guest of

[00:01 - 00:04]
the build and I want to do something a

[00:03 - 00:06]
little different this time. I want to

[00:04 - 00:08]
kind of flip this on its head. Instead

[00:06 - 00:10]
of having it be that the first prompt

[00:08 - 00:12]
has to be matched at the end, I want to

[00:10 - 00:15]
make it so that the prompts actually get

[00:12 - 00:17]
a little wild so they grow as we go.

[00:15 - 00:18]
Which means every time you're guessing

[00:17 - 00:20]
somebody's build, just add your own

[00:18 - 00:22]
thing to it. Whatever. Whatever. Just

[00:20 - 00:24]
make something up. Add to the add to the

[00:22 - 00:25]
prompt for the next person. Try to make

[00:24 - 00:27]
them build something. You know what I

[00:25 - 00:29]
mean? All right. Pass it on edition. I'm

[00:27 - 00:30]
going to screw you so much. Whoever is

[00:29 - 00:32]
after me, D. Can't wait to see how wild

[00:30 - 00:34]
these get. All right, everybody take a

[00:32 - 00:37]
second. Get your uh get your Just pick a

[00:34 - 00:39]
noun. Whatever. One word, two words,

[00:37 - 00:40]
whatever. Whatever. Not just a single

[00:39 - 00:42]
single word, single thing, whatever.

[00:40 - 00:46]
First, place the thing. Go. Uh we'll go

[00:42 - 00:47]
with uh milk carton. That's it. So,

[00:46 - 00:49]
what's kind of nice about this is like

[00:47 - 00:51]
our initial build should actually be

[00:49 - 00:52]
fairly simple. I don't even know that

[00:51 - 00:53]
we're going to need like all five

[00:52 - 00:55]
minutes. You know what I'm going to go

[00:53 - 00:57]
with, dude? We're going with a unicycle

[00:55 - 00:59]
chicken. Don't know why I said it in a

[00:57 - 01:01]
Scottish accent, but it's chicken. All

[00:59 - 01:02]
right, we are going to go wild with

[01:01 - 01:04]
this, guys. We're going to build Big

[01:02 - 01:06]
Ben. All right, we're going to do a uh

[01:04 - 01:08]
lava lamp cuz that's what's in my

[01:06 - 01:11]
office. Person place or thing. I'm doing

[01:08 - 01:13]
a person/ place. I have sir on I'm

[01:11 - 01:15]
hoping this first build to be fairly

[01:13 - 01:18]
simple. Please let us go. Everyone's

[01:15 - 01:20]
getting a case of the silly silly. It's

[01:18 - 01:22]
happening fast. Silly. Hardly nowhere.

[01:20 - 01:23]
All right, let's get going, shall we?

[01:22 - 01:25]
All right. Yeah, let's do it. Ready? 3 2

[01:23 - 01:27]
3 1 go. So, milk carton. I'm going to go

[01:25 - 01:31]
with the classic squared off kind of

[01:27 - 01:34]
milk carton. We'll go five by five. We

[01:31 - 01:36]
have enough time. Let's not go too

[01:34 - 01:38]
big cuz

[01:36 - 01:41]
otherwise we'll be here all night. This

[01:38 - 01:45]
is This is a kind of a wheel, isn't it?

[01:41 - 01:48]
Yes, it is. Wait a minute. Something got

[01:45 - 01:50]
stupid. What got stupid? We're doing it

[01:48 - 01:53]
white, of course, because people will

[01:50 - 01:56]
recognize it more if it's white. Let's

[01:53 - 01:56]
build the wing.

[01:56 - 02:01]
Like so. Lovely. It might look like a

[01:59 - 02:02]
goose. I've just realized it could look

[02:01 - 02:05]
like a goose. We need to make sure the

[02:02 - 02:07]
neck is not too long so people don't

[02:05 - 02:10]
think it's a goose. Who is guessing

[02:07 - 02:12]
this? Is it Jimmy? Oh, it might be

[02:10 - 02:15]
Jimmy. I don't know if Jimmy can guess

[02:12 - 02:17]
this. I don't know if he's watched this.

[02:15 - 02:18]
And I can't even judge him because I

[02:17 - 02:20]
also don't watch movies. But I think

[02:18 - 02:22]
that everybody should watch Lord of the

[02:20 - 02:24]
Rings. You can clearly tell that I

[02:22 - 02:25]
didn't do my homework cuz I just looked

[02:24 - 02:28]
at what was in my

[02:25 - 02:32]
office and saw the lava lamp. And then I

[02:28 - 02:36]
looked to my left or right and I saw

[02:32 - 02:39]
Skis. I was like, "Haha, original idea.

[02:36 - 02:41]
Let's put Skis in a lava lamp." You

[02:39 - 02:43]
know, the more I think about this, the

[02:41 - 02:46]
more it might actually be hard to see.

[02:43 - 02:48]
Wait, maybe if they go around the edge,

[02:46 - 02:50]
right, we could do something like this,

[02:48 - 02:53]
right? So that it actually kind of

[02:50 - 02:56]
spells out milk. That is good, dude.

[02:53 - 02:58]
Okay, now I need to have a different

[02:56 - 02:59]
type of Let's bring Let's get uh iron

[02:58 - 03:02]
blocks. I don't know why I keep going

[02:59 - 03:06]
back to iron, but we're doing iron. And

[03:02 - 03:08]
we need it to come straight up like

[03:06 - 03:11]
this. Okay. And I need to have a seat up

[03:08 - 03:14]
here. So this is the this is the seat. I

[03:11 - 03:16]
need to put some gold along it, I think,

[03:14 - 03:19]
as well. because it adds a lot. It adds

[03:16 - 03:21]
a bit of gold, but like Oh, this is

[03:19 - 03:23]
going to look stupid, isn't it? You know

[03:21 - 03:26]
what? I might just do one ski head if

[03:23 - 03:28]
I've if I've even got the space for it.

[03:26 - 03:29]
I don't know what the next person is

[03:28 - 03:30]
going to do with this, but I'm excited

[03:29 - 03:35]
to

[03:30 - 03:37]
see. There we go. Nice bit of orange on

[03:35 - 03:38]
there. Does that look like a chicken? I

[03:37 - 03:40]
mean, chickens normally have their eyes

[03:38 - 03:43]
a bit further apart, don't they? Like

[03:40 - 03:46]
this. But then, does that look

[03:43 - 03:48]
weird? Kind of. kind of weird. I'm done

[03:46 - 03:52]
really early, so I'm just going to hang

[03:48 - 03:54]
out. I'm done. I crushed it. Thing is,

[03:52 - 03:58]
the Big Ben tower, it kind of has like

[03:54 - 04:00]
gold. It looks kind of like golden with

[03:58 - 04:02]
its kind of like features and details

[04:00 - 04:06]
and stuff. It don't look like this, by

[04:02 - 04:09]
the way. So, maybe just don't take this

[04:06 - 04:10]
as um reference. Honestly, that's that's

[04:09 - 04:12]
kind of enough time. I've kind of done

[04:10 - 04:15]
it. I'm just going to catch a couple of

[04:12 - 04:18]
things on fire and then that will do.

[04:15 - 04:20]
Who's following me? Oh no. Oh, it's

[04:18 - 04:22]
Skis. Skiis knows what chickens look

[04:20 - 04:24]
like,

[04:22 - 04:26]
right? Uh, I think I got his eyes the

[04:24 - 04:28]
wrong way around. Oh, I've got less than

[04:26 - 04:29]
a minute. This is not good. I didn't

[04:28 - 04:33]
even do it the

[04:29 - 04:36]
same the same width. It's longer than it

[04:33 - 04:42]
is than it is

[04:36 - 04:42]
thick. I'm an idiot. And time is up.

[04:43 - 04:48]
Well, I'm not That's not too shabby. All

[04:46 - 04:51]
things considered, that's not too

[04:48 - 04:53]
shabby. Genuinely horrendous. What do

[04:51 - 04:55]
you mean? You had to build one thing one

[04:53 - 04:57]
thing. I'm telling you, that should have

[04:55 - 04:58]
been the easiest build you've ever done.

[04:57 - 05:00]
It might have been the worst thing

[04:58 - 05:04]
you've ever seen in your life. Oh, come

[05:00 - 05:04]
on, dude. And I'm following you.

[05:04 - 05:10]
Everybody move. Wait, you're not. You're

[05:08 - 05:13]
not going to have a clue, right? Great.

[05:10 - 05:15]
Just let you know. A mug. A blade of

[05:13 - 05:17]
grass. I'm so annoyed myself. I guess

[05:15 - 05:19]
this is fitting because we're basically

[05:17 - 05:21]
making stuff up anyway to add to the

[05:19 - 05:23]
prompt. So,

[05:21 - 05:24]
that's fine. Right. All right. Go ahead.

[05:23 - 05:26]
Reveal. Go ahead, Jimmy. Reveal. Kick it

[05:24 - 05:28]
off. A keyboard

[05:26 - 05:31]
perhaps. Do you know what that is,

[05:28 - 05:34]
Jimmy?

[05:31 - 05:36]
A cloud. I I I know it, but I can't

[05:34 - 05:39]
remember the name of it. Oh my god,

[05:36 - 05:41]
Jimmy. Come on. I think we fried him,

[05:39 - 05:42]
dude. I think Jimmy's gone. He hasn't

[05:41 - 05:46]
recovered from Joel's round. This is a

[05:42 - 05:46]
cool way to help.

[05:47 - 05:53]
I'm going to look at Skizzes now. Watch

[05:49 - 05:55]
this reaction, please. I know what that

[05:53 - 05:56]
is. Brilliant. Ski. Next one. We're

[05:55 - 05:58]
going to move along quickly here because

[05:56 - 06:01]
you will know what this is instantly.

[05:58 - 06:04]
Let's do it.

[06:01 - 06:07]
Oh, easy. Right. Okay. Next. Okay.

[06:04 - 06:09]
Brian, what have you built? Easy. Right.

[06:07 - 06:12]
Yep. Perfect. Keep it rolling. Keep it

[06:09 - 06:15]
rolling. Keep it rolling. You know about

[06:12 - 06:17]
it. What? Who am I following? Impulse.

[06:15 - 06:19]
Yeah. Full circle if you need to. But I

[06:17 - 06:20]
was expecting to hear the word easy.

[06:19 - 06:24]
Yeah, that's the word you're looking

[06:20 - 06:24]
for. Yeah, that's that's

[06:25 - 06:31]
I actually Okay. Can I call the umpire?

[06:28 - 06:32]
What is this? Did you do a full circle

[06:31 - 06:35]
around it? I literally spelled it out

[06:32 - 06:38]
for you. Okay. Oh, should we mute and

[06:35 - 06:40]
guess? Yep. Mute up and guess. Okay. So,

[06:38 - 06:44]
this is

[06:40 - 06:45]
um the eye of Sauron from Lord of the

[06:44 - 06:47]
Rings the

[06:45 - 06:53]
tower.

[06:47 - 06:56]
But the eye is 10 times the size of the

[06:53 - 06:58]
tower. Okay, this is the fun part of

[06:56 - 07:00]
Impulse's video cuz I know this is a

[06:58 - 07:02]
unicycle and I don't have to build what

[07:00 - 07:04]
I'm about to guess. So, I'm going to add

[07:02 - 07:07]
something to this that is very

[07:04 - 07:10]
difficult. Let's go. An

[07:07 - 07:13]
elephant riding a

[07:10 - 07:18]
unicycle

[07:13 - 07:20]
cycle holding a mouse on its

[07:18 - 07:23]
trunk. And do you know what that is?

[07:20 - 07:25]
That's not my problem. That's what that

[07:23 - 07:27]
is. This I mean literally it's like

[07:25 - 07:29]
there's a command that says build a

[07:27 - 07:31]
duck, right? That's a duck, right? This

[07:29 - 07:32]
is This is a very good That's is that

[07:31 - 07:35]
That's a duck. This is a good duck.

[07:32 - 07:37]
Duck.

[07:35 - 07:40]
Oh, dude. I'm so sorry. I was trying to

[07:37 - 07:40]
shoot through your legs to hit that

[07:40 - 07:46]
duck. That's

[07:44 - 07:49]
chicken. Oh, right. Okay. So, I'm going

[07:46 - 07:52]
to say it's a chicken and I need to add

[07:49 - 07:56]
to it. This is a chicken

[07:52 - 07:58]
putting in a contact lens. Why would I

[07:56 - 08:00]
do that to myself? All right. This is a

[07:58 - 08:01]
skill lava lamp. That's basically what

[08:00 - 08:05]
it is. But we get to add something to

[08:01 - 08:08]
it. walking down a

[08:05 - 08:10]
road. There we go. Okay. It It is It is

[08:08 - 08:12]
actually what I thought it was. It He

[08:10 - 08:17]
did spell it out. It is milk. It is a

[08:12 - 08:20]
carton of milk. Carton of milk that is

[08:17 - 08:25]
preparing for

[08:20 - 08:27]
launch to Saturn. This looks like um a

[08:25 - 08:29]
clock tower. I mean, do I call it Big

[08:27 - 08:30]
Ben? It's got the pointy tip and then

[08:29 - 08:32]
it's just a full thing and then this

[08:30 - 08:34]
guy. Yeah, that's Big Ben. Okay, great.

[08:32 - 08:36]
But Big Ben doing what? We got to come

[08:34 - 08:38]
up with that. Big Ben

[08:36 - 08:39]
enjoying a

[08:38 - 08:42]
day

[08:39 - 08:44]
out at the

[08:42 - 08:48]
circus. Okay, good luck. This is where

[08:44 - 08:49]
friendships are lost. I just realized.

[08:48 - 08:51]
Have fun with that. Actually being a bit

[08:49 - 08:54]
vindictive. We're just like trying to be

[08:51 - 08:54]
horrible.

[08:55 - 09:00]
The eye of Sauron's tower, but the eye

[08:58 - 09:03]
is 10 times bigger than the tower. Are

[09:00 - 09:06]
you kidding me? My prompt is an elephant

[09:03 - 09:08]
riding a unicycle holding a mouse on its

[09:06 - 09:10]
trunk. I

[09:08 - 09:12]
genuinely I don't think I'm going to be

[09:10 - 09:14]
able to sleep tonight. I don't think I'm

[09:12 - 09:16]
going to be able to sleep tonight. My

[09:14 - 09:20]
prompt is a chicken putting on contact

[09:16 - 09:22]
lenses. Look at this prompt. A ski lava

[09:20 - 09:24]
lamp walking down a road. How am I

[09:22 - 09:26]
supposed to do that? I can't do

[09:24 - 09:28]
anything. I suck. Okay, we I'm great.

[09:26 - 09:31]
I'm great. Carton of milk that is

[09:28 - 09:34]
preparing for launch. I like it. I like

[09:31 - 09:36]
it. Okay,

[09:34 - 09:38]
this is I I don't know how I'm going to

[09:36 - 09:41]
pull this off. Are we ready? I think I'm

[09:38 - 09:41]
ready.

[09:41 - 09:48]
Uh, now now if if I

[09:46 - 09:50]
was a good

[09:48 - 09:55]
[Music]

[09:50 - 09:57]
builder, which I'm obviously not. Um, I

[09:55 - 10:01]
would I

[09:57 - 10:04]
would do world edit, right? And like

[10:01 - 10:06]
make this pretty fast. What does a wheel

[10:04 - 10:08]
look like? See, I'm that broken. What

[10:06 - 10:10]
does a wheel look like? All right, let's

[10:08 - 10:12]
do this. First thing I'm going to do is

[10:10 - 10:13]
I'm going to build a little stool for

[10:12 - 10:16]
our chicken to sit on because he's got

[10:13 - 10:18]
to be ch he's got to be sitting at a

[10:16 - 10:20]
vanity. I've decided I'm my instincts

[10:18 - 10:23]
are telling me to go a little bit bigger

[10:20 - 10:26]
than this instincts. Like I have those.

[10:23 - 10:29]
Make a little launch pad like that. And

[10:26 - 10:31]
then we'll put these on the ground.

[10:29 - 10:34]
Maybe. Wait, we could do like iron maybe

[10:31 - 10:38]
underneath this. That's it. Got the

[10:34 - 10:39]
circus. Boom. Circus done. Easy. I'm

[10:38 - 10:43]
This is This one's going to get me in

[10:39 - 10:44]
trouble for sure. For sure. Um, and I

[10:43 - 10:46]
would like to be able to spend a little

[10:44 - 10:49]
bit of time on the top bit. This is

[10:46 - 10:53]
going to be my elephant, guys.

[10:49 - 10:53]
Imagine there's like circus music going

[10:56 - 11:00]
on. But we'll finish the vanity later

[10:58 - 11:01]
cuz that's not actually the important

[11:00 - 11:04]
part of this prompt. The important part

[11:01 - 11:05]
is that I nailed the chicken. I think it

[11:04 - 11:07]
was a chicken, right? Yeah. No, it was

[11:05 - 11:08]
definitely a chicken. Sometimes you got

[11:07 - 11:10]
to double check the ski cuz you start

[11:08 - 11:13]
reading what he wrote and you get all

[11:10 - 11:16]
confused real fast. A a Skiis lava lamp.

[11:13 - 11:17]
Are you kidding me? What? What is that?

[11:16 - 11:19]
Before I tell you what it is, that

[11:17 - 11:21]
sounds awesome. And then we'll put like,

[11:19 - 11:24]
you know, I feel like they have like

[11:21 - 11:26]
things like this on them to make sure

[11:24 - 11:28]
it's going to launch. We'll put like

[11:26 - 11:30]
some grind stones underneath to make it

[11:28 - 11:33]

We're almost there. I' I've only going

[11:54 - 12:00]
fence. That can't be a And then we just

[11:58 - 12:02]
We get a mirror going here. Cuz you need

[12:00 - 12:05]
a mirror if you're putting in contacts.

[12:02 - 12:08]

[12:15 - 12:20]
dude. Yes, it is perfect. I'm really

[12:18 - 12:22]
happy with this. I think this is really

[12:20 - 12:25]
good. I've got 30 seconds to make this

[12:22 - 12:30]
look better, but he's enjoying himself

[12:25 - 12:30]
at at at the circus.

[12:33 - 12:40]
So, this the best I can do. I got 15

[12:37 - 12:43]
seconds. I hate this so much. Okay,

[12:40 - 12:45]
let's get a road here. No. Okay, well, I

[12:43 - 12:48]
got no road. We're going. We don't need

[12:45 - 12:49]
roads. I think Green's going to get it.

[12:48 - 12:52]
Let's see. What do you think, Green? Go

[12:49 - 12:56]

[12:56 - 13:00]
Okay. Yeah. Well, I know what that is.

[12:57 - 13:02]

something. This

[13:04 - 13:06]
You'll get it. I can't give you any more

[13:05 - 13:09]
hints. I gave you a hint on the last

[13:06 - 13:13]
one. All right, let's see what we got.

[13:09 - 13:17]
Jimmy uh has made Love it. Okay, next

[13:13 - 13:18]
trick is

[13:17 - 13:23]
Oh my gosh.

[13:18 - 13:23]

[13:23 - 13:29]
[Music]

[13:24 - 13:32]
What? I'm sorry. Who is this? What?

[13:29 - 13:36]
What? What? I can't wait for everybody

[13:32 - 13:36]
else to have to see this.

[13:36 - 13:40]
I got to teach you about arms, dude.

[13:38 - 13:42]
What is going on? Wait till you see the

[13:40 - 13:44]
prompt, dude. Just wait.

[13:42 - 13:46]
Uh, you know what that is, right, dude?

[13:44 - 13:50]
You know what that is. You know what

[13:46 - 13:52]
that is? Radical, my dude.

[13:50 - 13:55]
Oh. Oh, I know what this is. Cool. All

[13:52 - 13:59]
right, let's reveal mine. Joel, I spent

[13:55 - 14:02]
all my time on the big bit. I forgot to

[13:59 - 14:06]
What is the thing in the

[14:02 - 14:09]
It's an icon. It's a Oh, wait. I think

[14:06 - 14:11]
No, maybe. All right, everybody.

[14:09 - 14:13]
Everybody take a guess and then figure

[14:11 - 14:14]
out what you want to add to your prompt.

[14:13 - 14:16]
All right. An

[14:14 - 14:22]
elephant

[14:16 - 14:24]
carrying a duck while riding a

[14:22 - 14:26]
unicycle. I hope that's how you spell

[14:24 - 14:28]
that. On the

[14:26 - 14:31]
freeway. So, they're going to have to

[14:28 - 14:33]
make a I hope freeway is a universal

[14:31 - 14:35]
term that the Brits will understand. But

[14:33 - 14:37]
hope yeah, they should know it. Okay.

[14:35 - 14:41]
I'm trying to guess what I'm looking at

[14:37 - 14:46]
here, guys. It's either a

[14:41 - 14:49]
duck. A duck checking out

[14:46 - 14:50]
glass. Why is he holding glass? He's

[14:49 - 14:53]
looking in a

[14:50 - 14:57]
mirror. What's happening here? Cuz he's

[14:53 - 14:57]
got glass in his

[14:57 - 15:03]
eye. A

[14:59 - 15:07]
glass. A duck with a glass eye looking

[15:03 - 15:12]
at a piece of glass while looking into a

[15:07 - 15:15]
sheet of glass. Oh my

[15:12 - 15:18]
gosh. So I think this is

[15:15 - 15:23]
Skis as a tall drink of

[15:18 - 15:27]
water on a walking table in a b a

[15:23 - 15:31]
beautiful meadow. This is a milk

[15:27 - 15:32]
carton. That is a rocket ship. And I got

[15:31 - 15:34]
to add something. And I don't have to

[15:32 - 15:39]
build this. So I can do whatever I want.

[15:34 - 15:39]
A Bill Carton rocket ship. Um being

[15:41 - 15:50]
flown by by a

[15:46 - 15:53]
turtle. Take that gem. Okay. So I think

[15:50 - 15:55]
this is a grandfather clock in a circus

[15:53 - 15:58]
tent. And we're going to add in Oh,

[15:55 - 16:01]
Posquez riding a

[15:58 - 16:02]
unicycle. Let's see if he could Let's

[16:01 - 16:06]
see if he could do that. The eye of

[16:02 - 16:09]
Sauron looking at What would What would

[16:06 - 16:11]
the eye of Sauron look at? I'm just I'm

[16:09 - 16:13]
just I don't have to build this. There.

[16:11 - 16:14]
Look. There you go. The eye of Sauron

[16:13 - 16:16]
looking at a puppy version of Skiz and

[16:14 - 16:19]
blushing. There you go. Someone else has

[16:16 - 16:20]
to deal with this mess.

[16:19 - 16:23]
All right. Feel free to read your

[16:20 - 16:26]
prompts. Start thinking about it.

[16:23 - 16:26]
Okay.

[16:26 - 16:31]
No. Literally not. Literally not.

[16:29 - 16:33]
Literally not.

[16:31 - 16:34]
I ain't ready. I ain't going. I ain't

[16:33 - 16:36]
ready.

[16:34 - 16:39]
I'm

[16:36 - 16:41]
literally I'm ready. Green. I'm ready.

[16:39 - 16:44]
Gri

[16:41 - 16:45]
Oh, here we go. All right. A duck. Okay.

[16:44 - 16:47]
A duck. Right. We're going to go We're

[16:45 - 16:52]
going to go classic duck here.

[16:47 - 16:56]
Um duck feet. Duck feet. Duck feet.

[16:52 - 16:59]
Longer. Longer. Staggered. Maybe. Ooh,

[16:56 - 17:03]
now we're getting fancy. Staggered. Duck

[16:59 - 17:05]
feet. Okay, sure. Jeez Louise. How am I

[17:03 - 17:07]
supposed to make a Do you know what? My

[17:05 - 17:09]
table's going to have Oh, no. A table

[17:07 - 17:12]
has four

[17:09 - 17:15]
legs. Stupid Jimmy. And then we'll do

[17:12 - 17:19]
like the rocket part right here. Like

[17:15 - 17:22]
this. Uh, yellow. And then orange.

[17:19 - 17:25]
The turtle is the bit that I think ski

[17:22 - 17:27]
added. And so that's just going to go on

[17:25 - 17:29]
top. Oh, let's let's make a let's see if

[17:27 - 17:31]
we can get some time on there, right?

[17:29 - 17:31]
Does this look like

[17:32 - 17:38]
time? Kind of. Is that time, dude? I

[17:36 - 17:39]
don't know. The glass part. There's no

[17:38 - 17:42]
way. So, this is where this challenge

[17:39 - 17:46]
gets super hard because you have to

[17:42 - 17:48]
build fast, which is not my strong suit.

[17:46 - 17:50]
So, why did I come up with this? Well,

[17:48 - 17:52]
because I thought it would be fun. Okay.

[17:50 - 17:54]
I thought it would be fun to see what

[17:52 - 17:56]
people come up with when they have the

[17:54 - 17:58]
freedom to make their own prompts like

[17:56 - 18:00]
on the fly, you know? And that's that's

[17:58 - 18:02]
where we're at. Excuse you. Okay. I'm

[18:00 - 18:04]
going to make So, this is like like the

[18:02 - 18:05]
black hole that this slide, you know

[18:04 - 18:06]
what I mean? Like, have you guys ever

[18:05 - 18:08]
seen where you kind of like come out of

[18:06 - 18:10]
the slide and it's got like the like the

[18:08 - 18:12]
black tube that you came out of and now

[18:10 - 18:13]
you're kind of like sliding down. Yeah.

[18:12 - 18:16]
Perfect. And it's got to have little

[18:13 - 18:18]
guardrails on it cuz, you know, safety

[18:16 - 18:22]
first, everybody. There we go. That's

[18:18 - 18:28]
not too bad. Right. Okay. Got the legs

[18:22 - 18:32]
going. He's a G. It's so stupid. This is

[18:28 - 18:34]
clearly a turtle. Hold on. Moss right

[18:32 - 18:36]
here for the little turtle's

[18:34 - 18:39]
tail.

[18:36 - 18:42]
Beautiful. It's a turtle. And then I do

[18:39 - 18:42]
a button. I do a button for

[18:43 - 18:48]
eyeballs. Very nice. Okay. Milk carton.

[18:46 - 18:50]
Rocket ship flown by a

[18:48 - 18:51]
turtle. I don't know how you can get any

[18:50 - 18:53]
better than that to be honest. I think

[18:51 - 18:55]
I've nailed that. Let's do some skullk

[18:53 - 18:57]
now because that will look like it's in

[18:55 - 18:59]
space.

[18:57 - 18:59]
Time.

[19:00 - 19:05]
No. Ran out of time so bad.

[19:06 - 19:12]
Mine was a person or a place. Eye of

[19:09 - 19:15]
Sauron. Eye of Sauron. Eye of Sauron.

[19:12 - 19:17]
Going with the Lord of the Rings. Lord

[19:15 - 19:21]
of the Rings. Right. So, who was after

[19:17 - 19:23]
this? Hol. Jimmy. I built I guess. No,

[19:21 - 19:25]
wait. I did the guess. Yeah, Jimmy did

[19:23 - 19:29]
the guest. Added something. You added

[19:25 - 19:33]
some Jimmy, right? What did you add?

[19:29 - 19:35]
A. Did we somehow lose this? No. No. No.

[19:33 - 19:37]
I think What did you add, Jimmy? I think

[19:35 - 19:40]
I know what might have gone a little

[19:37 - 19:43]
wrong. I just changed it. What's

[19:40 - 19:43]
different?

[19:45 - 19:51]
I didn't build this. I didn't build it.

[19:48 - 19:54]
You gave the prompt. Yeah. Okay. The eye

[19:51 - 19:57]
of I changed it. But the eye is 10 times

[19:54 - 20:00]
bigger than the tower. Yeah, I still

[19:57 - 20:02]
changed it. I don't know if I nailed it

[20:00 - 20:05]
10 times, but that's as big as I could

[20:02 - 20:06]
do. What the heck? What do you mean? For

[20:05 - 20:10]
me, for me, this was just the eye of

[20:06 - 20:11]
Sauron just built badly.

[20:10 - 20:14]
Well, that's a prompt as well, I

[20:11 - 20:16]
suppose. Eye of Saron, but worse. Three

[20:14 - 20:19]
of the added.

[20:16 - 20:22]
Okay. The eye of Saron looking at a

[20:19 - 20:24]
puppy version of Skiis. And Ran out of

[20:22 - 20:26]
time. Ran out of time, guys. Ran out. Oh

[20:24 - 20:29]
my gosh. I had to make up for the last

[20:26 - 20:31]
one. I couldn't do the eyes. The puppy

[20:29 - 20:33]
did not turn out.

[20:31 - 20:36]
It kind of looks like a I realize now it

[20:33 - 20:39]
looks like it's burnt the puppy. I

[20:36 - 20:42]
realized the puppy. Death beam. Oh, poor

[20:39 - 20:45]
guy. That time it was very spam clicky.

[20:42 - 20:48]
It was the final guest. Final guest says

[20:45 - 20:50]
crushed it. By the way, I have Syron

[20:48 - 20:54]
frying a sweet

[20:50 - 20:56]
little so dark. It got dark. It got

[20:54 - 20:58]
dark.

[20:56 - 21:00]
Let's move on from that. Hey, ISRO made

[20:58 - 21:01]
it though. Initial object made it. I was

[21:00 - 21:05]
curious to see if that would that would

[21:01 - 21:07]
still happen. It did. Next lane. Okay,

[21:05 - 21:10]
this is me.

[21:07 - 21:14]
Okay, so my prompt was simple. Just

[21:10 - 21:15]
straight up a unicycle. See?

[21:14 - 21:17]
Good

[21:15 - 21:19]
uncle pedals. Dude, you've you've

[21:17 - 21:21]
practiced that, haven't you? You

[21:19 - 21:23]
practice that, brother.

[21:21 - 21:24]
Hey, that's that's a creative world

[21:23 - 21:27]
right there. That's a comfy That's a

[21:24 - 21:30]
comfy looking seat. I see. I see you. I

[21:27 - 21:31]
see. Okay, first of all, no, I would

[21:30 - 21:34]
never do that to the show. Second of

[21:31 - 21:37]
all, I very shocked you guys think that

[21:34 - 21:42]
that's good at all.

[21:37 - 21:45]
So I made it my mission build. Oh, huh.

[21:42 - 21:47]
So it was my mission to make Jimmy's

[21:45 - 21:48]
life very hard. So all my additions are

[21:47 - 21:51]
Oh boy. So

[21:48 - 21:54]
Jeff changed it to an elephant riding a

[21:51 - 21:57]
unicycle holding a mouse on its trunk. I

[21:54 - 21:58]
think you'll be happy. Kind of. Okay.

[21:57 - 22:03]
Mouse.

[21:58 - 22:04]
Oh, Jimmy. Jiggles. This is good. The

[22:03 - 22:06]
only thing I couldn't get right is the

[22:04 - 22:09]
mouse. I I didn't know what to do with a

[22:06 - 22:09]
mouse. This is a great

[22:11 - 22:19]
ele The head to body ratio is fantastic.

[22:15 - 22:20]
Don't do that again, Jim. It was good.

[22:19 - 22:23]
Who had to guess this? Who had to guess

[22:20 - 22:25]
it? I had to guess that one. And Jimmy

[22:23 - 22:28]
did such a good job. I only mistook the

[22:25 - 22:30]
mouse for a duck. I think I put This is

[22:28 - 22:32]
good. You put an elephant carrying a

[22:30 - 22:34]
duck while riding a unicycle on the

[22:32 - 22:36]
freeway. That's good. Yeah, I added the

[22:34 - 22:38]
freeway. I'm sorry, Green. I hope we're

[22:36 - 22:42]
still friends after this. Freeway, baby.

[22:38 - 22:45]
I didn't add any cars, but Oh, got the

[22:42 - 22:48]
lines. Got the lines. Okay. Look at that

[22:45 - 22:50]
duck. Oh, I like the duck. Duck. A

[22:48 - 22:53]
lovely little I like the birch. The

[22:50 - 22:55]
duck. Such a good duck. I guess the

[22:53 - 22:57]
breed of duck.

[22:55 - 23:00]
Is that a malard? An elephant riding a

[22:57 - 23:02]
unicycle down the street holding a

[23:00 - 23:05]
malard duck. Wow. Nice.

[23:02 - 23:06]
That was really well done.

[23:05 - 23:08]
Really well done. Good job, everybody.

[23:06 - 23:11]
Good job. No one messed up. Well done,

[23:08 - 23:13]
everyone. So, I also kept it really

[23:11 - 23:16]
simple. My prompt was chicken. All

[23:13 - 23:18]
right, my Bill. And it's just chicken.

[23:16 - 23:20]
Chicken.

[23:18 - 23:22]
I'm telling you, dude. I was like, is

[23:20 - 23:25]
there a world edit like command that's

[23:22 - 23:27]
set chicken?

[23:25 - 23:30]
That's really good. Can't get that

[23:27 - 23:33]
wrong. Can't get that wrong. So, who has

[23:30 - 23:35]
altered this? I changed it. Yeah. To a

[23:33 - 23:41]
chicken putting in contact lenses.

[23:35 - 23:41]
Jesus. Oh my gosh. That's so hard.

[23:41 - 23:48]
Oh my goodness. So good. So good, Jim.

[23:46 - 23:51]
So good. Oh, it went all right. It went

[23:48 - 23:53]
bad after. That's a good build, though.

[23:51 - 23:54]
I love how it stood on the stool. Did

[23:53 - 23:56]
you see the other eyeball? Look at the

[23:54 - 23:58]
other eyeball at the end of it. That's

[23:56 - 24:02]
great.

[23:58 - 24:04]
I I guessed it. Jimmy guessed it. Right.

[24:02 - 24:07]
Just

[24:04 - 24:09]
You set me up. You son of a So we've

[24:07 - 24:11]
already got it wrong. A duck with a

[24:09 - 24:13]
glass. By the way, a duck. Jimmy duck.

[24:11 - 24:16]
Sorry.

[24:13 - 24:17]
I don't know my birds. I don't know my

[24:16 - 24:20]
birds.

[24:17 - 24:22]
With a glass eye inspecting a piece of

[24:20 - 24:25]
glass while looking at himself in the

[24:22 - 24:29]
mirror while sliding. No, but wait. he

[24:25 - 24:31]
added while sliding down a big slide.

[24:29 - 24:33]
Jimmy, right? Wait, wait, wait, wait,

[24:31 - 24:35]
wait, wait. Go look at the previous one.

[24:33 - 24:36]
It looks like he's got glass eye looking

[24:35 - 24:39]
at a piece of glass while in front of a

[24:36 - 24:42]
mirror. All right. Okay. Yeah, maybe we

[24:39 - 24:44]
focus on the animal.

[24:42 - 24:47]
Oh, we got

[24:44 - 24:48]
to I built this. You have to understand

[24:47 - 24:51]
my confusion when I went from building a

[24:48 - 24:53]
malard duck to then seeing a malard duck

[24:51 - 24:56]
right in the next one. What are the odds

[24:53 - 24:58]
of that? Yeah, that's very weird.

[24:56 - 25:01]
Look at his glass eye by the way. Yeah,

[24:58 - 25:04]
this glass one glass eye looking at a

[25:01 - 25:06]
piece of glass holding a mirror. I love

[25:04 - 25:08]
that. That's great. I love that. And the

[25:06 - 25:11]
final guess is Professor Duck escaping

[25:08 - 25:15]
from the inflat inflatable plane hatch

[25:11 - 25:17]
with an extra monle. I love that. I I

[25:15 - 25:19]
love that.

[25:17 - 25:21]
Good guess. Gosh, good guess. Amazing.

[25:19 - 25:24]
Gosh, that was tough. Well, you're so

[25:21 - 25:27]
pressed about the duck, guys. I just

[25:24 - 25:30]
Sorry, Jimmy. I almost said duck at

[25:27 - 25:32]
first and it's a photograph of a chicken

[25:30 - 25:34]
and I

[25:32 - 25:37]
go for something super simple at the

[25:34 - 25:39]
start. I did uh lava lamp with ski

[25:37 - 25:43]
inside.

[25:39 - 25:46]
Oh, lavis lava lamp. Oh my gosh. Very

[25:43 - 25:48]
easy. Very nice. Nice. Yeah, obviously.

[25:46 - 25:51]
Ski. What they What have they done to my

[25:48 - 25:52]
boy? Oh man, this his poor face. Try to

[25:51 - 25:56]
guess

[25:52 - 25:58]
that walking down a road. So, let's see

[25:56 - 26:00]
how Ski did this.

[25:58 - 26:04]
Oh no.

[26:00 - 26:04]
Oh no.

[26:06 - 26:12]
Ski, look at this angle. Grant, you need

[26:08 - 26:16]
this angle. I nearly threw up. Wait.

[26:12 - 26:16]
Yeah. Why?

[26:16 - 26:19]
Why

[26:19 - 26:25]
the not doing yourself any favors here?

[26:23 - 26:28]
You feel like a Why does he, bro? Why

[26:25 - 26:30]
does he look like You know, Jo, when you

[26:28 - 26:31]
put yourself in one of those black bins,

[26:30 - 26:35]
that's what it looks like. It's got

[26:31 - 26:38]
inside of a black bin. Oh, so good. So,

[26:35 - 26:42]
who had to guess this? Me. I had to

[26:38 - 26:46]
guess it. What did you do from that? Oh

[26:42 - 26:46]
gosh. Go on. What did you do?

[26:48 - 26:54]
Jeff said ski as a tall drink of water

[26:51 - 26:56]
on a on a walking table in a beautiful

[26:54 - 26:59]
meadow. Yeah, I got this. Sorry about

[26:56 - 27:03]
that. Okay, it was guys. It was so

[26:59 - 27:05]
tough. This is my mind, dude. I mean,

[27:03 - 27:07]
look at what I had to go off of. I need

[27:05 - 27:08]
to like I'm going to save that. I'm

[27:07 - 27:11]
going to put it in the hall of ski with

[27:08 - 27:14]
all the other Skiis builds that made me

[27:11 - 27:16]
howl. That one's That one's in there.

[27:14 - 27:18]
That one's in there with the final

[27:16 - 27:20]
guess, dude. The final guess was Skizzle

[27:18 - 27:23]
Man's face melting off while strolling

[27:20 - 27:25]
through the park and his body as a

[27:23 - 27:27]
table. I mean, the melting ski is still

[27:25 - 27:29]
kind of there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. His

[27:27 - 27:32]
face was melting off. I'm taking a

[27:29 - 27:33]
picture real quick. Oh my gosh. That's

[27:32 - 27:35]
going in the hall, man. I'm getting a

[27:33 - 27:38]
screenshot. Oh, that's going in my

[27:35 - 27:40]
nightmares.

[27:38 - 27:44]
It's the arms. The arms. Why are the

[27:40 - 27:48]
arms like that? Side on view. Why the

[27:44 - 27:51]
legs though? I look like you have any

[27:48 - 27:53]
shame in this. All right. Who's next?

[27:51 - 27:55]
Okay, this one's my lane. Uh, initial

[27:53 - 27:58]
prompt on this one. Super simple. Just a

[27:55 - 28:00]
milk carton.

[27:58 - 28:01]
Oh yeah.

[28:00 - 28:02]
I was afraid I didn't build it good

[28:01 - 28:06]
enough, so I actually wrote milk across

[28:02 - 28:09]
it. If you follow around. Oh, is that

[28:06 - 28:11]
what you did? Okay. I can't see milk.

[28:09 - 28:12]
Oh, I can see. Yeah. Well, I did not

[28:11 - 28:15]
make a M very good with that amount of

[28:12 - 28:18]
letters. Yeah. Everybody just stood in

[28:15 - 28:20]
the circle. M I L K.

[28:18 - 28:24]
I did think it was milk, but then I

[28:20 - 28:26]
thought, is it? Yeah. Back. Is it? No.

[28:24 - 28:28]
Yeah, it's milk. It's a milk carton. Had

[28:26 - 28:30]
to guess. Green had to guess it. And uh

[28:28 - 28:32]
I I gave him a little bit. I gave him

[28:30 - 28:34]
said he he said his belt out. So, okay.

[28:32 - 28:38]
Carton of milk. Got it. Perfect. Um,

[28:34 - 28:41]
that's preparing for launch. Gave it to

[28:38 - 28:45]
him. I pretty much gave it to him. Yeah.

[28:41 - 28:48]
Whoa, this is so good. That is good.

[28:45 - 28:53]
Preparing to launch. Wow. Who did this

[28:48 - 28:55]
one? Me. Oh, Jo. That's so guys. It's a

[28:53 - 28:57]
cart of milk. Preparing to launch. It's

[28:55 - 28:58]
It's going to outer space. There's no

[28:57 - 29:00]
There's no getting around that one. It's

[28:58 - 29:03]
like functional. It looks absolutely

[29:00 - 29:06]
functional. So, who guessed? So, who

[29:03 - 29:09]
guessed that one? I did. And I added to

[29:06 - 29:13]
it. Yeah. A milk carton rocket ship

[29:09 - 29:15]
being flown by a turtle. Okay. I added

[29:13 - 29:17]
the turtle. Added the turtle. Oh, and

[29:15 - 29:22]
we've gone horizontal.

[29:17 - 29:22]
This is flying through space. Very nice.

[29:23 - 29:27]
The turtle hitching a ride on a milk

[29:25 - 29:29]
carton. That's so good. Nice. This is so

[29:27 - 29:32]
good. Very nice. Very nice. Okay, final

[29:29 - 29:34]
guess on this one is a turtle riding a

[29:32 - 29:36]
spaceship into space. Oh, we lost the

[29:34 - 29:38]
milk. I couldn't get the milk. I

[29:36 - 29:40]
couldn't get it from that. I don't think

[29:38 - 29:42]
Yeah, it does. We lost the carton. Kind

[29:40 - 29:44]
of stayed. That's okay cuz the turtle

[29:42 - 29:46]
makes it worth it. I just I tried to get

[29:44 - 29:48]
milk carton shape, but maybe they're

[29:46 - 29:50]
different in Britain. I was doing the

[29:48 - 29:51]
ones where you rip the you know, you

[29:50 - 29:53]
squeeze the top together and then you

[29:51 - 29:55]
open up just a little flappy flap on

[29:53 - 29:56]
them. You know, the schoolyard ones.

[29:55 - 29:58]
Milk cartons in Britain. No, we don't

[29:56 - 30:01]
really do milk cartons here. This this

[29:58 - 30:05]
build, Joel, is just so good. Turn

[30:01 - 30:05]
around and it met me.

[30:07 - 30:15]
Oh, man. Right. Start of the hall. Yeah.

[30:11 - 30:19]
My my prompt was um embarrassingly. Uh

[30:15 - 30:21]
it was Big Ben. Oh, Big Ben. Oh, what do

[30:19 - 30:22]
you mean embarrassingly? Just cuz you

[30:21 - 30:25]
didn't finish the bag. Yeah, it was.

[30:22 - 30:27]
Yeah. Um, obviously doesn't look like

[30:25 - 30:31]
that in real life. Um, right. And who

[30:27 - 30:34]
guesses? I had to guess that. I got you.

[30:31 - 30:39]
Big Ben the bell. English. Big Ben

[30:34 - 30:41]
enjoying a day out at the circus.

[30:39 - 30:44]
I had a hard time. This is Big Ben. I

[30:41 - 30:45]
thought, okay, did you got a big thumbs

[30:44 - 30:48]
up?

[30:45 - 30:51]
He's got to be enjoying his day.

[30:48 - 30:53]
Okay. Fantastic. Fantastic. Well done. I

[30:51 - 30:56]
had to guess this. We've got a

[30:53 - 30:58]
grandfather clock in a circus tent

[30:56 - 31:00]
riding a unicycle. Unicycle. Okay, we

[30:58 - 31:03]
lost Big Ben. Just a grandfather clock

[31:00 - 31:05]
now. Excuse me. I did not know what this

[31:03 - 31:10]
is. Okay, I want you to be so nice about

[31:05 - 31:13]
my final guess because stick

[31:10 - 31:16]
is that the That's the time. It's It

[31:13 - 31:18]
looks like the Jamaican flag. Oh my

[31:16 - 31:20]
gosh.

[31:18 - 31:22]
What? What is the actual clock part of

[31:20 - 31:24]
it? What's the stick for? It's the

[31:22 - 31:28]
clock. That's the top of the grandfather

[31:24 - 31:31]
clock. Okay, so who had to guess this?

[31:28 - 31:33]
Wow, genuinely I don't know what you

[31:31 - 31:36]
could have guessed. I feel so bad for

[31:33 - 31:37]
Jem right now. I I would have cried. I

[31:36 - 31:41]
have no idea what this is. Right, here

[31:37 - 31:43]
we go. Carnival game on a unicycle under

[31:41 - 31:44]
a circus tent. Question mark question

[31:43 - 31:46]
mark. Question mark question mark

[31:44 - 31:48]
question mark times 10. All right,

[31:46 - 31:50]
that's good. Good enough. Good enough.

[31:48 - 31:52]
There it is. Okay. Well, circus lives.

[31:50 - 31:54]
Not a There's clocks in the game. Skiz,

[31:52 - 31:57]
why don't you put a clock there? Oh,

[31:54 - 32:01]
yeah.

[31:57 - 32:03]
A stick. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, that one

[32:01 - 32:06]
went about as sideways as I expected it

[32:03 - 32:08]
to. Well done, everybody. Hope we're all

[32:06 - 32:10]
still friends after this one. Great

[32:08 - 32:12]
work. Another fun time. The ski lava

[32:10 - 32:15]
lamp. Yeah, lava lamp. Yeah. One more

[32:12 - 32:18]
look at the ski lava lamp before we go.

[32:15 - 32:18]
So beautiful.

Ngl i rly wasnt expecting to start a mini war about the colour of chickens i ofc meant the minecraft kind..... but thx for the likes ig ppl

Can't use the color to differentiate them.

What would have helped would be to add the red combs and wattles
