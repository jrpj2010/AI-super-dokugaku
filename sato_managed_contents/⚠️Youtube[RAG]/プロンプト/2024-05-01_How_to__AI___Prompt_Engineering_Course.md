## Â≠óÂπï

[00:00 - 00:07]
most people know about Chad GPT but now

[00:03 - 00:07]
we have a new free AI tool called

[00:07 - 00:13]
Claude it is not only faster but also

[00:10 - 00:15]
more creative in this master class I

[00:13 - 00:17]
will teach you how to use AI for

[00:15 - 00:19]
researching and learning new subjects

[00:17 - 00:21]
and analyzing and writing documents

[00:19 - 00:24]
after finishing this master class you'll

[00:21 - 00:26]
know the top techniques for prompting AI

[00:24 - 00:29]
at your day-to-day work my name is Ana

[00:26 - 00:31]
and I train businesses about technology

[00:29 - 00:33]
and Design so without further Ado let's

[00:31 - 00:36]
get

[00:33 - 00:39]
started this course has three chapters

[00:36 - 00:42]
number one basics of AI and llms then

[00:39 - 00:44]
basics of clawed Ai and then at the end

[00:42 - 00:46]
basics of prompt engineering let's start

[00:44 - 00:49]
with chapter number one basics of AI and

[00:46 - 00:51]
llms we need to First understand what is

[00:49 - 00:53]
AI which is artificial intelligence what

[00:51 - 00:56]
is an llm which is a large language

[00:53 - 00:58]
model and what is a chatbot by the way

[00:56 - 01:00]
we are Distributing printed certificates

[00:58 - 01:02]
of completion to stud students who

[01:00 - 01:04]
finish all of their homework and tasks

[01:02 - 01:06]
mentioned in this video You' need to

[01:04 - 01:08]
complete three tasks task number one is

[01:06 - 01:10]
to mention your top learnings and

[01:08 - 01:12]
feedback in the comment section if

[01:10 - 01:14]
you're watching this video in gaps take

[01:12 - 01:16]
notes in a different tool but make sure

[01:14 - 01:18]
you paste all of your final notes in the

[01:16 - 01:20]
comment section and do not use AI for it

[01:18 - 01:22]
I will know if you cheat people think

[01:20 - 01:25]
that AI is just about Chad GPT whereas

[01:22 - 01:28]
in reality AI has a lot of subjects

[01:25 - 01:30]
under it so let's understand what is AI

[01:28 - 01:33]
actually before understanding ing AI

[01:30 - 01:35]
let's understand what is intelligence

[01:33 - 01:38]
see if I had to oversimplify I can say

[01:35 - 01:40]
that if a person learns from her past

[01:38 - 01:43]
experiences and successfully decides

[01:40 - 01:45]
what to do today and tomorrow then we

[01:43 - 01:47]
will call that person intelligent if a

[01:45 - 01:49]
person lives life but doesn't learn from

[01:47 - 01:52]
mistakes then we don't call that person

[01:49 - 01:54]
intelligent now if a person learns from

[01:52 - 01:57]
the mistakes of other people we call

[01:54 - 01:59]
that person even more intelligent but

[01:57 - 02:01]
how can you learn from the mistakes of

[01:59 - 02:03]
other people of of course by reading

[02:01 - 02:06]
books or listening to stories or

[02:03 - 02:08]
watching movies basically you consume

[02:06 - 02:10]
information written by other people now

[02:08 - 02:13]
artificial intelligence is trying to do

[02:10 - 02:16]
the same but inside a machine now

[02:13 - 02:19]
imagine AI to be a box and this box only

[02:16 - 02:22]
has two core skills it can read and form

[02:19 - 02:24]
patterns but right now it has not read

[02:22 - 02:26]
anything because we just created this

[02:24 - 02:29]
box so there is no reading and there is

[02:26 - 02:31]
no patterns to form now we want this box

[02:29 - 02:33]
to be become intelligent but then this

[02:31 - 02:36]
box is not a living person so it cannot

[02:33 - 02:39]
learn from its own experiences therefore

[02:36 - 02:41]
we decide to feed our own experiences

[02:39 - 02:44]
and stories into this box so we decide

[02:41 - 02:47]
to collect millions of Articles and

[02:44 - 02:50]
posts and images all around the internet

[02:47 - 02:52]
to train this box if needed I can put in

[02:50 - 02:54]
my own personal files as well because it

[02:52 - 02:57]
is not necessary that internet has all

[02:54 - 02:59]
the relevant information that I have in

[02:57 - 03:01]
my brain or in my personal files to make

[02:59 - 03:05]
this training even more high quality

[03:01 - 03:07]
maybe I can handpick and choose articles

[03:05 - 03:10]
that are very well written or short list

[03:07 - 03:13]
only high quality images because as the

[03:10 - 03:15]
owner of this box I don't want my box to

[03:13 - 03:17]
learn from lowquality inspiration or

[03:15 - 03:19]
terribly written articles right so we

[03:17 - 03:23]
first put in a lot of information in

[03:19 - 03:26]
this AI box so that with time this box

[03:23 - 03:29]
can begin to read and form patterns but

[03:26 - 03:31]
how does it do that simply by reading

[03:29 - 03:33]
everything and finding commonalities so

[03:31 - 03:37]
basically it would read every text we

[03:33 - 03:39]
feed into it one by one for example if I

[03:37 - 03:43]
have uploaded 10 million articles about

[03:39 - 03:44]
animals almost 6 to seven articles would

[03:43 - 03:48]
probably have a sentence that says I

[03:44 - 03:50]
have a dog and he has four legs and most

[03:48 - 03:52]
probably this sentence would come again

[03:50 - 03:54]
and again because in most cases if

[03:52 - 03:57]
there's an article on the internet about

[03:54 - 04:00]
a dog it will mention that it has four

[03:57 - 04:02]
legs therefore my AI box will

[04:00 - 04:05]
automatically start learning that if I

[04:02 - 04:07]
have a dog he will have four legs but

[04:05 - 04:09]
then in the real world I can have a

[04:07 - 04:11]
female dog that only has three legs

[04:09 - 04:14]
because of an accident but because my

[04:11 - 04:17]
training data was biased AI would not be

[04:14 - 04:19]
able to accurately predict anything

[04:17 - 04:22]
correctly about my dog this is a very

[04:19 - 04:24]
important concept the current form of AI

[04:22 - 04:27]
that you and I use whether it's inside

[04:24 - 04:30]
Chad GPT or Google Gemini or even Claude

[04:27 - 04:33]
is limited because it has been trained

[04:30 - 04:36]
on a specific limited training data open

[04:33 - 04:39]
AI who has created Chad GPT had its own

[04:36 - 04:42]
data and thropic who has created Claude

[04:39 - 04:45]
has its own data this data has not come

[04:42 - 04:47]
from ai's real life experiences it has

[04:45 - 04:49]
come from the internet and their

[04:47 - 04:51]
personal files but you and I both know

[04:49 - 04:54]
that information on the internet is not

[04:51 - 04:56]
the most accurate representation of how

[04:54 - 04:59]
the world works the real world is way

[04:56 - 05:02]
more nuanced and subjective that is why

[04:59 - 05:04]
a tool like Claude needs our help to

[05:02 - 05:06]
fill in those gaps before we move ahead

[05:04 - 05:08]
I'd like to thank today's sponsor ODU

[06:11 - 06:16]
at a cost that is lower than ever before

[06:14 - 06:18]
I've already released a short tutorial

[06:16 - 06:19]
on their project management tool in our

[06:18 - 06:21]
last income video I'll share that link

[06:19 - 06:24]
in description let's go back to the

[06:21 - 06:26]
master class you need to understand that

[06:24 - 06:29]
the current form of AI that you and I

[06:26 - 06:32]
use today is not behind us or ahead of

[06:29 - 06:34]
us it is is here to stand next to us if

[06:32 - 06:37]
we are smart enough then we can

[06:34 - 06:40]
complement the weaknesses of AI and work

[06:37 - 06:43]
together to build great things but if

[06:40 - 06:45]
you don't learn or upskill then AI will

[06:43 - 06:47]
get ahead of you in many many ways if

[06:45 - 06:49]
you don't have real life experiences or

[06:47 - 06:51]
if you lack clear thinking or if you

[06:49 - 06:53]
simply don't understand human psychology

[06:51 - 06:56]
then you will lose your Edge to AI

[06:53 - 06:58]
because for AI to understand how human

[06:56 - 07:00]
beings behave and think on a day-to-day

[06:58 - 07:03]
basis is actually very Tri key now your

[07:00 - 07:05]
task number two is to ask yourself and

[07:03 - 07:08]
find out at least three things that you

[07:05 - 07:09]
feel AI would never be able to replace

[07:08 - 07:12]
write them down in your comment and

[07:09 - 07:15]
explain why AI would never be able to do

[07:12 - 07:17]
that I want everyone to publicly see

[07:15 - 07:19]
what all answers and reasonings do we

[07:17 - 07:21]
get in the comment section and we expect

[07:19 - 07:23]
you to support us on this journey if you

[07:21 - 07:25]
complete all of these tasks remember you

[07:23 - 07:27]
will get a chance to win a printed

[07:25 - 07:29]
certificate from us by the way just

[07:27 - 07:31]
doing task one and task two is not

[07:29 - 07:33]
enough because task three is highly

[07:31 - 07:35]
important as well and I'll tell you task

[07:33 - 07:39]
three at the end of the video now coming

[07:35 - 07:42]
back is AI all about chat GPT or Claude

[07:39 - 07:44]
no AI has actually almost six subjects

[07:42 - 07:47]
under it and I want you to spend just a

[07:44 - 07:49]
few minutes with me to understand what

[07:47 - 07:52]
they are on the very top we have machine

[07:49 - 07:54]
learning or ml this subject is all about

[07:52 - 07:57]
building a machine that can learn and

[07:54 - 07:59]
improve from experience chat GPT and

[07:57 - 08:01]
Claude are an application of machine

[07:59 - 08:03]
learning but let me give you some very

[08:01 - 08:05]
basic use cases of machine learning

[08:03 - 08:07]
because this is not very new you and I

[08:05 - 08:08]
have been using the applications of

[08:07 - 08:12]
machine learning since a very very long

[08:08 - 08:14]
time the spam warning on your emails or

[08:12 - 08:16]
Netflix recommending you a movie based

[08:14 - 08:18]
on your history or even Instagram

[08:16 - 08:20]
recommending you content all of these

[08:18 - 08:22]
are very basic applications of machine

[08:20 - 08:25]
learning now within machine learning we

[08:22 - 08:27]
have another subset called Deep learning

[08:25 - 08:30]
or DL deep learning is also about

[08:27 - 08:32]
learning and improving but deep learning

[08:30 - 08:35]
is very very close to how human beings

[08:32 - 08:37]
learn it uses a technique which is very

[08:35 - 08:39]
similar to a technique that our human

[08:37 - 08:42]
brains use which is called a neural

[08:39 - 08:44]
network our brains have real neural

[08:42 - 08:46]
networks whereas deep learning

[08:44 - 08:48]
algorithms use artificial neural

[08:46 - 08:50]
networks and if you want to learn more

[08:48 - 08:52]
about this just ask Claude once I've

[08:50 - 08:54]
taught you this because you don't need

[08:52 - 08:57]
me for that now examples of deep

[08:54 - 09:00]
learning include voice assistants like

[08:57 - 09:02]
Siri or Alexa that are trained on a big

[09:00 - 09:04]
data of possibilities but they actually

[09:02 - 09:06]
never really know what you will ask so

[09:04 - 09:09]
at some level they need to think a

[09:06 - 09:11]
little more logically as compared to an

[09:09 - 09:14]
email spam filter or Netflix

[09:11 - 09:17]
recommendations then we have natural

[09:14 - 09:20]
language processing or NLP this allows a

[09:17 - 09:23]
machine to understand text and then

[09:20 - 09:26]
respond to questions written in text and

[09:23 - 09:28]
it deals with figuring out the emotion

[09:26 - 09:31]
behind a specific text as well features

[09:28 - 09:34]
like summarization of Articles also

[09:31 - 09:36]
comes under NLP next we have computer

[09:34 - 09:38]
vision that helps a machine look at

[09:36 - 09:41]
things stuff like facial recognition

[09:38 - 09:43]
systems or those CCTV cameras that you

[09:41 - 09:45]
see at red light that can capture cars

[09:43 - 09:47]
over a speed limit that is also an

[09:45 - 09:51]
application of computer vision any AI

[09:47 - 09:53]
image reader or Creator all of these are

[09:51 - 09:55]
applications of computer vision now

[09:53 - 09:58]
you're probably wondering an where does

[09:55 - 10:00]
Claude come into this where does Chad GP

[09:58 - 10:04]
come into this or all of these tools ml

[10:00 - 10:06]
or DL or NLP like what is it so let me

[10:04 - 10:09]
just simplify this on the very top we

[10:06 - 10:11]
have ai assume AI has two branches AI

[10:09 - 10:13]
actually has a lot of branches but just

[10:11 - 10:15]
for Simplicity let's assume it only has

[10:13 - 10:17]
two branches because that is what we are

[10:15 - 10:19]
studying today so you have machine

[10:17 - 10:21]
learning and natural language processing

[10:19 - 10:24]
now within machine learning we have deep

[10:21 - 10:26]
learning so deep learning is actually a

[10:24 - 10:28]
subset of machine learning and then

[10:26 - 10:30]
within deep learning we have a New

[10:28 - 10:33]
Concept called called large language

[10:30 - 10:36]
models now as I said this is an

[10:33 - 10:37]
oversimplification in reality this is

[10:36 - 10:40]
how the branching really looks like and

[10:37 - 10:42]
you can always Google or ask Claude to

[10:40 - 10:45]
understand this but for now let me

[10:42 - 10:48]
explain you what is an llm or a large

[10:45 - 10:50]
language model assume you have a robot

[10:48 - 10:53]
friend who loves to read books and learn

[10:50 - 10:55]
from the sentences in that book now this

[10:53 - 10:58]
robot has three skills number one it can

[10:55 - 10:59]
read a lot very fast number two if you

[10:58 - 11:02]
give it a topic

[10:59 - 11:04]
it can remember what it has read so far

[11:02 - 11:07]
and then write new things about this

[11:04 - 11:09]
topic but obviously it has only learned

[11:07 - 11:11]
from the books you have asked it to read

[11:09 - 11:14]
and number three if you ask it a

[11:11 - 11:17]
question it will quickly find answers

[11:14 - 11:19]
from its memory and try to form new

[11:17 - 11:21]
interesting perspectives from everything

[11:19 - 11:23]
it has read so far if you give it an

[11:21 - 11:25]
incomplete sentence it will help you

[11:23 - 11:27]
finish that sentence as well now this

[11:25 - 11:29]
robot is not as smart as a human being

[11:27 - 11:32]
because even as human beings we we don't

[11:29 - 11:36]
just read and remember we do a lot more

[11:32 - 11:38]
but this robot can read a lot and also

[11:36 - 11:41]
remember all of it and this robot is

[11:38 - 11:44]
actually what an llm looks like and llms

[11:41 - 11:46]
are not perfect as we move ahead in the

[11:44 - 11:48]
lecture you'll understand how llms are

[11:46 - 11:51]
actually working inside chat GPT or

[11:48 - 11:53]
Claud now before we move to chapter 2

[11:51 - 11:55]
let's quickly revise what we learned in

[11:53 - 11:58]
chapter number one we understood how AI

[11:55 - 12:01]
learns and how large language models are

[11:58 - 12:04]
an application of of ai ai has a lot of

[12:01 - 12:06]
things and it's not just chat GPT it has

[12:04 - 12:09]
a whole Squad of subjects like machine

[12:06 - 12:13]
learning deep learning NLP and computer

[12:09 - 12:15]
vision llms like Claude and Chad GPT are

[12:13 - 12:18]
trained on limited data so they need our

[12:15 - 12:20]
human touch and human intervention to

[12:18 - 12:22]
navigate the nuances of the real world

[12:20 - 12:25]
if that is clear let's start with

[12:22 - 12:27]
chapter number two basics of Claude AI I

[12:25 - 12:29]
want you to first visit claw. and then

[12:27 - 12:31]
just add your email address to get the

[12:29 - 12:33]
OTP once you've logged in you'll have a

[12:31 - 12:35]
free account and this is how the

[12:33 - 12:37]
interface would look like right now I'm

[12:35 - 12:38]
on my paid plan but even on the free

[12:37 - 12:40]
plan this is how it would look like so

[12:38 - 12:42]
you have your input field this is where

[12:40 - 12:44]
you can upload your files and this is

[12:42 - 12:46]
where you can start the conversation now

[12:44 - 12:49]
Claud is also an llm but all of these

[12:46 - 12:52]
llms have different versions or models

[12:49 - 12:55]
for example the free chat GPT llm gives

[12:52 - 12:57]
you access to GPT 3.5 to get their

[12:55 - 12:59]
Advanced GPT 4 model you need to pay

[12:57 - 13:01]
extra now Claude is owned by this

[12:59 - 13:03]
company called anthropic and just how

[13:01 - 13:07]
Chad GPT has different models like Chad

[13:03 - 13:09]
GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 in Claude you have

[13:07 - 13:13]
access to three models now if I come

[13:09 - 13:15]
here and say hello you notice that I

[13:13 - 13:17]
have this drop down right here if I

[13:15 - 13:20]
click on it I can see three options so

[13:17 - 13:23]
the free one is called Haiku and then we

[13:20 - 13:25]
have Sonet and then on the very top we

[13:23 - 13:28]
have Opus you can use haiku for free but

[13:25 - 13:31]
Sonet and Opus are paid so you have to

[13:28 - 13:33]
pay around2 $23.6 a month which is

[13:31 - 13:35]
almost 2,000 Rupees a month and it's

[13:33 - 13:38]
more expensive than Chad GPD and I would

[13:35 - 13:40]
first suggest you to learn on the free

[13:38 - 13:42]
version which is haiku because uh you

[13:40 - 13:43]
need to figure out how this tool works

[13:42 - 13:45]
and if you feel that it's worth it only

[13:43 - 13:48]
then you should invest in it now as you

[13:45 - 13:51]
can see from this graph Haiku is least

[13:48 - 13:54]
intelligent but also the fastest Opus is

[13:51 - 13:56]
the smartest but it takes maximum time

[13:54 - 13:57]
and sonnet comes somewhere in the middle

[13:56 - 14:00]
it's a good balance of speed and

[13:57 - 14:02]
accuracy now UK use these llms in your

[14:00 - 14:04]
own products and there are so many AI

[14:02 - 14:07]
startups that are using these llms to

[14:04 - 14:10]
become intelligent these AI startups are

[14:07 - 14:12]
actually just a different skin on an llm

[14:10 - 14:14]
and all of these startups are called

[14:12 - 14:18]
rappers most AI companies out there are

[14:14 - 14:21]
actually running on chat GP or Claud or

[14:18 - 14:23]
Gemini llms you as a consumer can use

[14:21 - 14:26]
these llms via chat so when I come to

[14:23 - 14:29]
Claude on this website I am using the

[14:26 - 14:31]
Claude llm and which llm it could be on

[14:29 - 14:33]
it it could be Opus it could be any

[14:31 - 14:35]
model and I'm using this via chat

[14:33 - 14:37]
because chatting is very easy right it's

[14:35 - 14:39]
the easiest interaction that people have

[14:37 - 14:41]
learned on the internet so before moving

[14:39 - 14:43]
to chapter number three let's quickly

[14:41 - 14:47]
revise chapter number two Claude has

[14:43 - 14:49]
three models Haiku Sonet and Opus Haiku

[14:47 - 14:52]
is free while paid plans will cost you

[14:49 - 14:54]
around 2,000 Rupees a month or $23.6 a

[14:52 - 14:57]
month most AI startups are actually

[14:54 - 14:59]
rappers on top of these popular llms so

[14:57 - 15:01]
if you're trying to create an AI startup

[14:59 - 15:03]
instead of thinking how can I make AI

[15:01 - 15:05]
you need to ask yourself how can I use

[15:03 - 15:07]
these llms in my own product you can use

[15:05 - 15:10]
llms in any way you want but most people

[15:07 - 15:12]
use it via a chatbot now let's start

[15:10 - 15:14]
with chapter number three basics of

[15:12 - 15:16]
prompt engineering which is the main

[15:14 - 15:19]
chapter of this entire course prompt

[15:16 - 15:22]
engineering is nothing but your ability

[15:19 - 15:24]
to set context and add constraints AI

[15:22 - 15:27]
doesn't know who you are and what you

[15:24 - 15:30]
want prompting is all about educating AI

[15:27 - 15:33]
about your specific need needs right now

[15:30 - 15:35]
ai tools are new so prompting as a skill

[15:33 - 15:38]
is very important moving forward the

[15:35 - 15:40]
value of prompting will go down because

[15:38 - 15:42]
if you write a terrible prompt AI will

[15:40 - 15:44]
automatically ask you more questions to

[15:42 - 15:46]
improve it see there is a checklist for

[15:44 - 15:48]
writing a great prompt and I will teach

[15:46 - 15:50]
you that checklist in just a few minutes

[15:48 - 15:53]
any task that has a checklist can be

[15:50 - 15:55]
easily automated using AI so my

[15:53 - 15:57]
prediction is that eventually all of

[15:55 - 15:59]
these tools will learn how to improve

[15:57 - 16:01]
your prompt on their own right now they

[15:59 - 16:03]
don't do it very well hence it's

[16:01 - 16:05]
important to learn the basics of prompt

[16:03 - 16:07]
engineering to get ahead now I know

[16:05 - 16:09]
these concepts are very new you will

[16:07 - 16:13]
have to watch this video at least two

[16:09 - 16:15]
times I am not exaggerating you have to

[16:13 - 16:17]
watch this video two times because it's

[16:15 - 16:20]
just very fresh but I'm telling you it's

[16:17 - 16:22]
absolutely worth it and you might also

[16:20 - 16:24]
have to ask more follow-up questions

[16:22 - 16:27]
either in Claud or chat GPT but trust me

[16:24 - 16:29]
having this basic understanding of how

[16:27 - 16:32]
llms work of how models work can take

[16:29 - 16:34]
you ahead of 99% of the people in your

[16:32 - 16:36]
industry now let's understand what all

[16:34 - 16:37]
can we do using Claud I've done so much

[16:36 - 16:40]
of theory it's time that we actually get

[16:37 - 16:42]
into the tool and I will categorize the

[16:40 - 16:45]
use cases into two categories text based

[16:42 - 16:48]
and image based and within text based I

[16:45 - 16:50]
will cover summarization writing and

[16:48 - 16:53]
editing and discussions and there are

[16:50 - 16:55]
many more use cases this QR code WR here

[16:53 - 16:57]
will open up a page that will have all

[16:55 - 16:59]
of these free links and documentations

[16:57 - 17:02]
neatly organized let me show you one

[16:59 - 17:04]
example for all of these three use cases

[17:02 - 17:06]
but before that I want you to understand

[17:04 - 17:09]
that as smart people we need to use AI

[17:06 - 17:11]
for our first draft and not last this

[17:09 - 17:13]
thing cannot replace your brain and

[17:11 - 17:15]
creativity it is a co-pilot and it is

[17:13 - 17:17]
standing next to you and not ahead of

[17:15 - 17:19]
you if you're watching me for the first

[17:17 - 17:21]
time then i' strongly recommend you to

[17:19 - 17:23]
see our basics of AI playlist because

[17:21 - 17:26]
there I've already explained how Ai and

[17:23 - 17:28]
humans actually work together moreover

[17:26 - 17:30]
anytime you're writing a prompt please

[17:28 - 17:32]
make sure you follow this four-part

[17:30 - 17:34]
checklist number one assign a relevant

[17:32 - 17:37]
role if you want marketing advice then

[17:34 - 17:39]
say act as a marketing specialist step

[17:37 - 17:41]
number two set the context and Define

[17:39 - 17:43]
your task tell AI who are you and what

[17:41 - 17:46]
are you trying to achieve step number

[17:43 - 17:48]
three set constraints otherwise AI will

[17:46 - 17:50]
assume that you have unlimited resources

[17:48 - 17:52]
unlimited time unlimited people

[17:50 - 17:54]
unlimited money and in the end clearly

[17:52 - 17:56]
Define expectations now what do I mean

[17:54 - 17:58]
by all of these steps let me teach you

[17:56 - 18:00]
via examples so let's start with some

[17:58 - 18:02]
summarization because that is the

[18:00 - 18:04]
easiest use case to learn basically I

[18:02 - 18:07]
can paste long articles documents and

[18:04 - 18:08]
PDFs to get quick summaries let me show

[18:07 - 18:12]
you how it works so let's just say I go

[18:08 - 18:14]
to Google and type ux

[18:12 - 18:16]
design

[18:14 - 18:19]
PDF and let's click on the first link it

[18:16 - 18:21]
is from the University of Mumbai and

[18:19 - 18:23]
let's just say that as a student I want

[18:21 - 18:26]
to analyze this PDF I have an exam on

[18:23 - 18:28]
this PDF now as you can see this is a

[18:26 - 18:31]
very very detailed PDF extremely well

[18:28 - 18:33]
written and it has almost 188 slides now

[18:31 - 18:36]
I can download

[18:33 - 18:38]
this now I'll come back to Claude click

[18:36 - 18:41]
on this file icon and then choose this

[18:38 - 18:43]
PDF and now this is the prompt that I

[18:41 - 18:46]
will paste read this PDF and summarize

[18:43 - 18:49]
module 1 for me in a simple language now

[18:46 - 18:51]
I can choose Haiku Sonet or Opus let's

[18:49 - 18:55]
just say I choose Haiku which is the

[18:51 - 18:55]
free plan and then I'll press on

[18:56 - 19:03]
send in less than 30 seconds I actually

[19:00 - 19:05]
got a very brief summary of module one

[19:03 - 19:07]
which is supremely impressive now this

[19:05 - 19:10]
is where people make mistakes if you're

[19:07 - 19:12]
studying for a real exam then you cannot

[19:10 - 19:15]
rely on this AI generated summary you

[19:12 - 19:17]
should first read module one on your own

[19:15 - 19:18]
and then use this summary to make quick

[19:17 - 19:20]
notes if you're simply researching

[19:18 - 19:22]
through multiple PDFs and you're not

[19:20 - 19:23]
sure about what you want to learn then

[19:22 - 19:25]
you can get summaries without reading

[19:23 - 19:28]
the actual content or sometimes you have

[19:25 - 19:30]
to find something from a really long PDF

[19:28 - 19:31]
which is not explicitly written and

[19:30 - 19:34]
maybe you have to do a lot of pattern

[19:31 - 19:36]
recognition in that case you can do the

[19:34 - 19:39]
same but make sure that the entire PDF

[19:36 - 19:41]
has text in it now what do I mean by

[19:39 - 19:43]
that if I open this PDF you would

[19:41 - 19:46]
realize that I can copy this text this

[19:43 - 19:48]
is not a scanned jpeg right so this is

[19:46 - 19:50]
very very important because if it is a

[19:48 - 19:53]
scan of jpeg it really won't work that

[19:50 - 19:54]
well now this prompt that I just showed

[19:53 - 19:57]
you right now was very straightforward

[19:54 - 19:59]
and very simple however I can follow my

[19:57 - 20:01]
four-part checklist and get get a much

[19:59 - 20:03]
better response and I'm sticking to

[20:01 - 20:05]
Haiku because a lot of you people will

[20:03 - 20:07]
be using the free plan so I will not

[20:05 - 20:08]
switch to opas for now we'll cover that

[20:07 - 20:11]
in our upcoming episodes when we do

[20:08 - 20:13]
advanced stuff so the new optimized

[20:11 - 20:15]
prompt would look like this I am a

[20:13 - 20:18]
student of ux design and I have an McQ

[20:15 - 20:20]
quiz coming up this week from module 1 I

[20:18 - 20:22]
want you to read module one and analyze

[20:20 - 20:25]
what all McQ questions can come from

[20:22 - 20:27]
that module first give me a list of all

[20:25 - 20:29]
important bullet points in a simple and

[20:27 - 20:31]
easy to understand language then

[20:29 - 20:33]
highlight all important keywords and

[20:31 - 20:35]
terms I should know about do not sound

[20:33 - 20:37]
like an AI keep your suggestions

[20:35 - 20:38]
relevant and to the point now let me

[20:37 - 20:41]
break down this prompt for you because

[20:38 - 20:43]
you need to understand the logic behind

[20:41 - 20:45]
this prompt and how have I written this

[20:43 - 20:46]
prompt firstly I have skipped assigning

[20:45 - 20:48]
a role because this task is not about

[20:46 - 20:50]
copyrighting or marketing or anything

[20:48 - 20:52]
very specific so you can always skip

[20:50 - 20:54]
that step but by saying I am a student

[20:52 - 20:57]
of ux design and I have an McQ quiz

[20:54 - 20:59]
coming up I am setting the context I am

[20:57 - 21:02]
educating Claude about who I I am and in

[20:59 - 21:04]
what context am I using him by saying I

[21:02 - 21:06]
want you to read module one and analyze

[21:04 - 21:09]
what all McQ questions can come from

[21:06 - 21:11]
that module I am defining the task and

[21:09 - 21:13]
by saying highlight all important

[21:11 - 21:16]
keywords and terms that I should know

[21:13 - 21:18]
about I am setting the constraints as to

[21:16 - 21:20]
what exactly do I want I want proper

[21:18 - 21:21]
bullet points now where is the

[21:20 - 21:23]
constraint because I'm specifically

[21:21 - 21:25]
saying give me bullet points highlight

[21:23 - 21:28]
the keywords and all the important terms

[21:25 - 21:30]
so by doing all of this and by saying do

[21:28 - 21:32]
not sound like an AI keep your

[21:30 - 21:35]
suggestions relevant and to the point I

[21:32 - 21:36]
am setting expectations that this is the

[21:35 - 21:39]
kind of output that I expect from you

[21:36 - 21:41]
now let me press enter and this was the

[21:39 - 21:43]
answer that we got from model number one

[21:41 - 21:46]
which is useful it is timesaving but now

[21:43 - 21:48]
let me show you the difference we get

[21:46 - 21:51]
when we do these things well so it has

[21:48 - 21:54]
come up with three important definitions

[21:51 - 21:57]
specific bullet points key terms and

[21:54 - 21:59]
keywords and then it is also giving me

[21:57 - 22:01]
important guidelines on preparing for my

[21:59 - 22:03]
quiz now you can obviously see the

[22:01 - 22:05]
difference between results that come

[22:03 - 22:07]
from a basic prompt versus a

[22:05 - 22:10]
well-engineered prompt now this specific

[22:07 - 22:12]
use case of summarization can help you

[22:10 - 22:14]
research on any subject Faster by

[22:12 - 22:16]
uploading content and saying summarize

[22:14 - 22:18]
this as if I'm a 10-year-old so if

[22:16 - 22:21]
you're trying to learn about quantum

[22:18 - 22:23]
mechanics or stock market or fundamental

[22:21 - 22:25]
analysis you can upload any PDF and say

[22:23 - 22:27]
explain this specific module to me as if

[22:25 - 22:29]
I'm a 10-year-old then you can

[22:27 - 22:31]
understand complete liated articles or

[22:29 - 22:33]
even research papers because there are

[22:31 - 22:34]
so many research papers that are very

[22:33 - 22:36]
difficult to understand but then you can

[22:34 - 22:38]
use this thing right here to easily

[22:36 - 22:40]
understand the most complicated subjects

[22:38 - 22:42]
all you need to do is upload your PDF

[22:40 - 22:44]
then you can summarize your own typed

[22:42 - 22:47]
notes so that you can revise easily just

[22:44 - 22:49]
before an exam to do that just upload

[22:47 - 22:51]
them to Claude ask it to read all of the

[22:49 - 22:52]
content and in fact ask it to make a

[22:51 - 22:54]
short quiz out of them so it can

[22:52 - 22:56]
actually read from your notes and then

[22:54 - 22:59]
quiz you so if you have notes of a topic

[22:56 - 23:01]
that you are weak in you can only export

[22:59 - 23:03]
those notes and then ask CLA to quiz you

[23:01 - 23:05]
and you can do this in any llm by the

[23:03 - 23:07]
way it's not just for clot but basically

[23:05 - 23:10]
anywhere but imagine how useful this can

[23:07 - 23:11]
be for you and in CLA you can upload up

[23:10 - 23:13]
to five documents so if I hover over

[23:11 - 23:15]
here you can see the limitation that you

[23:13 - 23:17]
can upload up to five documents with a

[23:15 - 23:20]
limit of 10 MB each so basically you can

[23:17 - 23:22]
upload five reports and ask Claude to

[23:20 - 23:24]
summarize everything in those PDFs or

[23:22 - 23:26]
maybe even find patterns now let's start

[23:24 - 23:28]
with use case number two writing and

[23:26 - 23:30]
editing because I have personally used

[23:28 - 23:33]
AI to get inspiration for my social

[23:30 - 23:35]
media captions or emails proposals

[23:33 - 23:38]
outlines for you know basic

[23:35 - 23:39]
presentations and YouTube titles and you

[23:38 - 23:41]
don't need me to list out all the

[23:39 - 23:43]
prompts because you already have the

[23:41 - 23:45]
four-part checklist I regularly share

[23:43 - 23:47]
useful prompts on my Instagram broadcast

[23:45 - 23:49]
channel and you can scan this QR code to

[23:47 - 23:51]
join it for free because I share a lot

[23:49 - 23:54]
of resources and behind the scenes and

[23:51 - 23:56]
updates only on my Instagram broadcast

[23:54 - 23:58]
now because I've told you the use cases

[23:56 - 24:00]
and the checklist I personally feel that

[23:58 - 24:02]
this is is all you really need but I

[24:00 - 24:04]
would still show you a quick example so

[24:02 - 24:06]
let's assume I want inspiration for

[24:04 - 24:08]
YouTube titles and you are working with

[24:06 - 24:10]
me in my team on my YouTube channel now

[24:08 - 24:13]
you should prompt something like this

[24:10 - 24:15]
act as a YouTube title specialist who's

[24:13 - 24:18]
an expert at longform viral infotainment

[24:15 - 24:21]
content I want you to give me 10 click

[24:18 - 24:23]
byy titles around the topic of AI and

[24:21 - 24:26]
designers working together keep the

[24:23 - 24:29]
titles simple but catchy do not make

[24:26 - 24:31]
them very verbos for each title give me

[24:29 - 24:34]
three bullet points of what I should

[24:31 - 24:36]
cover and do not sound like an AI now

[24:34 - 24:39]
I'll press enter and let's see what it

[24:36 - 24:41]
does now even though I have got a lot of

[24:39 - 24:44]
ideas the important rule here is that

[24:41 - 24:46]
you use AI for your first draft and not

[24:44 - 24:48]
the last I'm reminding you again and

[24:46 - 24:51]
again which means that I will use this

[24:48 - 24:53]
to get quick ideas but blend it with my

[24:51 - 24:55]
own Human Experience my own

[24:53 - 24:57]
understanding of what works for my

[24:55 - 25:00]
audience because if I blindly copy what

[24:57 - 25:02]
AI gives me my content will start to

[25:00 - 25:04]
look like everybody else's content and

[25:02 - 25:06]
this subtlety in the shift of you know

[25:04 - 25:08]
working with AI is very very important

[25:06 - 25:10]
to understand because if Brands fire

[25:08 - 25:11]
their creative people and rely on AI

[25:10 - 25:13]
they will stand the risk of sounding

[25:11 - 25:15]
like everyone else which defeats the

[25:13 - 25:17]
entire point the real game changers are

[25:15 - 25:20]
going to be teams that combine their

[25:17 - 25:22]
human brain with AI and we've already

[25:20 - 25:24]
explained this process in detail on our

[25:22 - 25:26]
AI playlist you can always visit our

[25:24 - 25:29]
free website how prom. in to get all of

[25:26 - 25:30]
those free courses in in fact here is a

[25:29 - 25:32]
little homework for you I just explained

[25:30 - 25:35]
you what is AI but I never really

[25:32 - 25:37]
explained you what is generative Ai and

[25:35 - 25:38]
why is it called generative Ai and how

[25:37 - 25:41]
is it different from any other type of

[25:38 - 25:43]
an AI you should ask Claude and figure

[25:41 - 25:45]
out what is generative Ai and why is it

[25:43 - 25:47]
named that way because that will teach

[25:45 - 25:49]
you how do you learn something new with

[25:47 - 25:50]
the help of AI because it's going to be

[25:49 - 25:53]
the biggest strength available now let's

[25:50 - 25:55]
cover our last use case which is about

[25:53 - 25:56]
having discussions and this is my

[25:55 - 25:59]
favorite one because it allows me to use

[25:56 - 26:01]
ai's intelligence and my intelligence

[25:59 - 26:03]
together but before I do that I want to

[26:01 - 26:05]
quickly take you through the entire

[26:03 - 26:08]
interface see on the very top we have

[26:05 - 26:10]
the menu so if I click on menu I will go

[26:08 - 26:11]
back to this homepage right here if I

[26:10 - 26:14]
click on my conversation I will come

[26:11 - 26:16]
back to my history if I click on plus I

[26:14 - 26:18]
will open a new chat now let me go back

[26:16 - 26:19]
to the menu again and if you hover on

[26:18 - 26:21]
top of anything you will also see the

[26:19 - 26:24]
shortcut key for it now let's just say I

[26:21 - 26:26]
start uh or even resume any of my older

[26:24 - 26:28]
conversations if I click on this Chevron

[26:26 - 26:31]
I can rename it or delete the

[26:28 - 26:33]
conversation here I can copy this if I'm

[26:31 - 26:35]
not satisfied with the response I can

[26:33 - 26:37]
click on retry and it will rerun the

[26:35 - 26:39]
same prompt again and you will get a

[26:37 - 26:41]
different result now at the very bottom

[26:39 - 26:43]
you can switch between different models

[26:41 - 26:45]
so if I click on Sonet it's not that in

[26:43 - 26:47]
the middle of the conversation I will

[26:45 - 26:49]
switch from Haiku to Sonet no because if

[26:47 - 26:52]
I click on Sonet it opens up a new

[26:49 - 26:53]
conversation altoe so please be aware of

[26:52 - 26:56]
that that it opens a new conversation

[26:53 - 26:58]
for a specific model on the top right

[26:56 - 27:00]
corner if I click on chat controls you

[26:58 - 27:03]
will see if you've added any images or

[27:00 - 27:05]
PDFs or spreadsheets because once you

[27:03 - 27:07]
use a conversation again and again you

[27:05 - 27:10]
should be able to access all of your

[27:07 - 27:12]
documents so if I go back to my menu and

[27:10 - 27:14]
let's say I go to the summarizing thing

[27:12 - 27:16]
here when I open chat controls you can

[27:14 - 27:19]
actually see the PDF and then you can

[27:16 - 27:21]
also see the extracted content from that

[27:19 - 27:24]
PDF so this is the content that it has

[27:21 - 27:26]
read here I can also choose between

[27:24 - 27:29]
different fonts and here is my account

[27:26 - 27:30]
details so I have already subscribed to

[27:29 - 27:33]
the Pro Plan and then in your account

[27:30 - 27:35]
settings you can always go and fix your

[27:33 - 27:36]
billing operations now there is no

[27:35 - 27:39]
mobile app for cloud so you would have

[27:36 - 27:41]
to use this either on your web browser

[27:39 - 27:43]
or on your phone browser it always tells

[27:41 - 27:45]
you that Claude can make mistakes so

[27:43 - 27:47]
please double check your responses I

[27:45 - 27:49]
also say the same then they have this

[27:47 - 27:51]
small notification that says that for

[27:49 - 27:54]
our most intelligent model switch to

[27:51 - 27:56]
Claude 3 Opus so with that being clear I

[27:54 - 27:58]
want us to start with a new use case and

[27:56 - 28:00]
then I'll open a new chat and this time

[27:58 - 28:02]
let me start with Opus because I think

[28:00 - 28:04]
we haven't tried it yet and I want to

[28:02 - 28:07]
see you how creative it gets anytime I'm

[28:04 - 28:10]
working on my startup idea or a video

[28:07 - 28:12]
idea or even a workshop for any client I

[28:10 - 28:15]
would first discuss the entire context

[28:12 - 28:17]
and syllabus with AI and this is how the

[28:15 - 28:20]
template Works let's say you are trying

[28:17 - 28:22]
to achieve X for a specific set of

[28:20 - 28:24]
people y this is how the prompt template

[28:22 - 28:27]
would look like I am trying to do X for

[28:24 - 28:30]
y I want you to think from the lens of

[28:27 - 28:34]
an X expert of X and tell me all the

[28:30 - 28:36]
important perspectives views and angles

[28:34 - 28:38]
I should consider while working on X so

[28:36 - 28:41]
if I'm doing this for an AI workshop for

[28:38 - 28:43]
ux designers I would say something like

[28:41 - 28:45]
this I am trying to host a workshop on

[28:43 - 28:48]
basics of AI for ux designers at a

[28:45 - 28:50]
fintech startup I want you to think from

[28:48 - 28:53]
the lens of an expert of ux design and

[28:50 - 28:55]
Ai and tell me all the important

[28:53 - 28:57]
perspectives views and angles I should

[28:55 - 29:00]
consider while working on this pitch te

[28:57 - 29:02]
I have 45 minutes slot I cannot demo but

[29:00 - 29:05]
I can speak about interesting mindset

[29:02 - 29:07]
shifts include important Concepts use

[29:05 - 29:09]
cases relevant examples and bullet

[29:07 - 29:11]
points for the entire pitch Tech and

[29:09 - 29:13]
then I will press enter now if you

[29:11 - 29:15]
remember a bit of a checklist you would

[29:13 - 29:18]
obviously notice that I have added the

[29:15 - 29:20]
context I have set the constraints I

[29:18 - 29:22]
have put the exact expectation that I

[29:20 - 29:25]
need right so I've said that I only have

[29:22 - 29:28]
45 minutes I cannot demo etc etc and now

[29:25 - 29:30]
as a professional I can use this to get

[29:28 - 29:34]
a Kickstart this answer is not a

[29:30 - 29:36]
replacement to my deck but I'm 100% sure

[29:34 - 29:38]
that this answer can give me a lot of

[29:36 - 29:41]
points that I would have missed out in

[29:38 - 29:43]
the beginning so imagine that if I

[29:41 - 29:45]
compete with anybody else in the same

[29:43 - 29:46]
market and if that person doesn't

[29:45 - 29:48]
understand this even if that person

[29:46 - 29:49]
knows about CLA but that person has no

[29:48 - 29:51]
clue about this prompting checklist I

[29:49 - 29:54]
will always have more leverage and you

[29:51 - 29:57]
can do this for anything for planning

[29:54 - 30:00]
for strategy for research imagine how

[29:57 - 30:03]
powerful ful you can be and it's so

[30:00 - 30:05]
strange why nobody is talking about this

[30:03 - 30:07]
openly why people are just not learning

[30:05 - 30:09]
about this why businesses are not doing

[30:07 - 30:11]
this right and that is what I am trying

[30:09 - 30:14]
to do as well that is why we have been

[30:11 - 30:15]
going on Consulting to many businesses

[30:14 - 30:17]
giving workshops giving all of these

[30:15 - 30:19]
trainings now I'll give you three more

[30:17 - 30:20]
tips which are very very important when

[30:19 - 30:23]
you're using these tools in your

[30:20 - 30:25]
day-to-day work number one always ask AI

[30:23 - 30:28]
first I used to first go to YouTube and

[30:25 - 30:29]
Google but now I always ask AI because

[30:28 - 30:32]
because AI helps me find the signal from

[30:29 - 30:34]
the noise earlier there were not enough

[30:32 - 30:36]
resources to learn from today there are

[30:34 - 30:38]
too many resources to learn from So You

[30:36 - 30:40]
obviously get confused you don't know

[30:38 - 30:43]
where to start but now with a tool like

[30:40 - 30:45]
CLA or chat GPT you can easily find the

[30:43 - 30:47]
most valuable things and the order in

[30:45 - 30:49]
which you need to learn those things so

[30:47 - 30:51]
if you get stuck at any specific use

[30:49 - 30:54]
case even from the QR code and if you

[30:51 - 30:56]
have any doubts just ask AI anytime I go

[30:54 - 30:58]
for live workshops a lot of people come

[30:56 - 31:01]
to me and say anch can AI do this for me

[30:58 - 31:02]
can Chad GPT write this can CLA think

[31:01 - 31:04]
about that I would never know the answer

[31:02 - 31:07]
the only way you can get an accurate

[31:04 - 31:09]
answer is by putting the prompts at use

[31:07 - 31:11]
because you know your subject well right

[31:09 - 31:13]
I would have no clue about your subject

[31:11 - 31:16]
so the only way to see if Claude or chbt

[31:13 - 31:17]
can help you is by using it but most

[31:16 - 31:19]
people are not using it and you can

[31:17 - 31:21]
always ask AI if it can do whatever

[31:19 - 31:24]
you're trying to do and you should

[31:21 - 31:25]
always ask what all it would need to

[31:24 - 31:28]
help you so with that I come to tip

[31:25 - 31:32]
number two that always allow AI to cross

[31:28 - 31:34]
question always add that ask me more

[31:32 - 31:41]
questions if you need Clarity so if I

[31:34 - 31:46]
say give me a pitch for a tech client

[31:41 - 31:49]
ask more questions if you need

[31:46 - 31:52]
Clarity when I do that I basically give

[31:49 - 31:54]
AI permission to cross question me

[31:52 - 31:56]
because otherwise AI would always assume

[31:54 - 31:58]
that I can't ask more now this is where

[31:56 - 32:00]
prompt engineering changes because if

[31:58 - 32:02]
you don't write a good prompt if you

[32:00 - 32:04]
write just one single sentence that asks

[32:02 - 32:06]
me more questions if you need Clarity

[32:04 - 32:08]
this itself is helping you write a

[32:06 - 32:09]
better prompt this is all about becoming

[32:08 - 32:11]
a better prompter but a lot of people

[32:09 - 32:13]
don't know this trick right so if you

[32:11 - 32:15]
are missing a lot of important details

[32:13 - 32:17]
always allow AI to cross question you so

[32:15 - 32:19]
that you can improve your prompts and

[32:17 - 32:22]
get better results and tip number three

[32:19 - 32:25]
upload examples for tonality see if you

[32:22 - 32:28]
want to learn it from your specific

[32:25 - 32:30]
writing style or your tone of voice

[32:28 - 32:33]
upload at least 10 articles or scripts

[32:30 - 32:36]
or proposals written by you and then ask

[32:33 - 32:38]
it to learn how you write because how

[32:36 - 32:40]
will it know your specific style it is

[32:38 - 32:42]
too unique to you and a lot of people

[32:40 - 32:44]
say that oh I ask uh Chad GP or claw to

[32:42 - 32:45]
write content and script and it doesn't

[32:44 - 32:47]
sound like me obviously it will not

[32:45 - 32:49]
sound like you because you have not

[32:47 - 32:51]
given enough examples so please make

[32:49 - 32:54]
sure that if you're writing content or

[32:51 - 32:57]
emails please input your own examples

[32:54 - 32:59]
first now your task number three is to

[32:57 - 33:01]
try any of these use cases that I've

[32:59 - 33:03]
just taught you take a screenshot or a

[33:01 - 33:05]
video recording and then explain your

[33:03 - 33:08]
learnings either on LinkedIn X or

[33:05 - 33:11]
Instagram copy the link to that post and

[33:08 - 33:15]
simply reply to your comment on this

[33:11 - 33:17]
YouTube video exactly 5 days from now my

[33:15 - 33:19]
team will go through the comment section

[33:17 - 33:21]
of this video to check your notes and

[33:19 - 33:23]
then we will finalize top entries now

[33:21 - 33:25]
the certification is not going to help

[33:23 - 33:27]
you get a job or something it is just a

[33:25 - 33:29]
way to appreciate that you have

[33:27 - 33:31]
completed did something my certificate

[33:29 - 33:33]
any other certificate none of these

[33:31 - 33:34]
things actually help you get a great job

[33:33 - 33:35]
even if you put thousands of

[33:34 - 33:36]
certificates on your LinkedIn profile

[33:35 - 33:38]
it's not going to do anything for you I

[33:36 - 33:41]
don't have any certifications in ux or

[33:38 - 33:43]
AI the reason I'm doing this is that you

[33:41 - 33:45]
have a goal now it's just a nice thing

[33:43 - 33:47]
to have and I want you to finish this

[33:45 - 33:49]
course end to end I could have made this

[33:47 - 33:51]
into a paid course as well I could have

[33:49 - 33:52]
directly come to just showing you the

[33:51 - 33:55]
tool and showing you the features and

[33:52 - 33:57]
I'm 100% sure there's going to be

[33:55 - 33:58]
someone in the comment section saying oh

[33:57 - 34:00]
there's so much of the where is where is

[33:58 - 34:02]
the features where is the fancy stuff

[34:00 - 34:04]
the truth is you never needed me for the

[34:02 - 34:06]
fancy stuff there are many people

[34:04 - 34:08]
teaching all of those tools and systems

[34:06 - 34:09]
you need me to understand how do you use

[34:08 - 34:11]
AI in the first place what is the

[34:09 - 34:14]
mindset shift that you need to have this

[34:11 - 34:16]
year now we just finished text based use

[34:14 - 34:18]
cases but image based use cases are

[34:16 - 34:21]
still left where you can use CLA to

[34:18 - 34:23]
analyze user interfaces or website

[34:21 - 34:26]
screenshots or brochures and graphs and

[34:23 - 34:29]
a lot more so if I go here you can

[34:26 - 34:30]
obviously upload any image on this and

[34:29 - 34:33]
just ask questions again and again but I

[34:30 - 34:34]
want to check if people even want this

[34:33 - 34:36]
category of content so if this video

[34:34 - 34:38]
performs well I will script part two

[34:36 - 34:41]
because I don't know if people are

[34:38 - 34:44]
interested if people are even finishing

[34:41 - 34:46]
this level of content our goal is to hit

[34:44 - 34:49]
2,000 likes and 1,000 comments on this

[34:46 - 34:51]
video so if you want us to make such

[34:49 - 34:53]
content I want your support I want you

[34:51 - 34:55]
to finish all of your tasks and then let

[34:53 - 34:57]
me know in the comments if you want part

[34:55 - 34:59]
two where we use Claude to analyze

[34:57 - 35:01]
images now before I end this video I

[34:59 - 35:03]
want to show you all a very very cool

[35:01 - 35:05]
website that can help you compare

[35:03 - 35:08]
different llms for free so remember I

[35:05 - 35:10]
told you that Claude has an llm chat GPT

[35:08 - 35:12]
has an llm similarly there's mixl there

[35:10 - 35:16]
is llama 2 so what you need to do is you

[35:12 - 35:18]
need to go to chat. LMS y.org it takes a

[35:16 - 35:20]
time sometimes it does this verification

[35:18 - 35:23]
thing but that's completely okay and

[35:20 - 35:25]
then go to Arena side by side now this

[35:23 - 35:27]
is extremely cool because you can choose

[35:25 - 35:30]
different models Model A and model B so

[35:27 - 35:34]
here in Model A I can choose CLA 3 Opus

[35:30 - 35:36]
and here I can probably choose say Chad

[35:34 - 35:38]
gp4 turbo and then you can put your

[35:36 - 35:40]
prompt here click on send and get

[35:38 - 35:42]
answers from both of these models and

[35:40 - 35:44]
these are paid models by the way now

[35:42 - 35:45]
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

[35:44 - 35:48]
I have tried it so it works for a lot of

[35:45 - 35:51]
cases and it's not just for gp4 you have

[35:48 - 35:52]
every single popular uh llm available

[35:51 - 35:55]
right here so when it comes to like

[35:52 - 35:57]
mistl or even llama and even you know

[35:55 - 35:59]
the Google Gemini models like all of of

[35:57 - 36:01]
these things are available for free so

[35:59 - 36:03]
you access not just claw chat GPT or

[36:01 - 36:05]
Gemini but all the other llm models and

[36:03 - 36:08]
you can compare which one works the best

[36:05 - 36:10]
for you before you actually purchase so

[36:08 - 36:13]
let me copy paste my same prompt and put

[36:10 - 36:15]
it here and click on send so now you can

[36:13 - 36:17]
see that for gp4 Turbo it's not working

[36:15 - 36:18]
because the model limit has been reached

[36:17 - 36:21]
it's probably because a lot of people

[36:18 - 36:23]
are trying to use gp4 turbo from their

[36:21 - 36:25]
website but on the left side I can get

[36:23 - 36:27]
access to Opus so opas worked and Opus

[36:25 - 36:31]
is paid so that's very cool let me

[36:27 - 36:34]
refresh and start again So Meta also is

[36:31 - 36:37]
building its own llm called Lama 2 and

[36:34 - 36:39]
let's just say instead of CLA 3 let's

[36:37 - 36:43]
try llama

[36:39 - 36:46]
213b and here I'll probably go and check

[36:43 - 36:49]
Cloud 3 Opus and then paste my prompt

[36:46 - 36:51]
and then click on send so now CLA 3 Opus

[36:49 - 36:53]
limit has reached but now llama is

[36:51 - 36:55]
available so you know you'd have to wait

[36:53 - 36:57]
and try see no valuable thing in the

[36:55 - 36:59]
world is for free I keep telling this to

[36:57 - 37:01]
people a lot of people say I want a free

[36:59 - 37:03]
tool I want a free tool nothing good

[37:01 - 37:05]
enough comes for free it's always a free

[37:03 - 37:07]
trial so I think this resource is good

[37:05 - 37:09]
uh if you have a lot of time to like do

[37:07 - 37:10]
an hit and trial you can always do that

[37:09 - 37:13]
and if you click on share uh then it

[37:10 - 37:14]
creates a JPEG of both of these answers

[37:13 - 37:16]
and then you can sort of share with your

[37:14 - 37:18]
people so if I click on this thing so

[37:16 - 37:20]
you can save all of these responses very

[37:18 - 37:23]
very easily I'll be waiting to see

[37:20 - 37:25]

I have been waiting for this video for a long time, but it finally came today. I watched the entire video, and I understand how AI works and How you can change my life using AI. I have been using Chatgpt since last year, but I struggle to upload files and get the summarized text content. Finally, I got the idea to use Claude's AI, and this website gives me a better chance to upgrade my life.


I have started watching your videos in the past month, but I love your content and editing. 

Thank you, Ansh

Task 1: My Learnings
1. It's essential to continually learn and adapt, as AI is rapidly advancing.
2.  Claude AI offers a trio of models, each tailored for specific tasks.
3.  Merging human creativity with AI's analytical power yields superior outcomes.
4. AI can be a valuable conversational partner, providing insights on a wide range of topics.

Task 2: AI's Limitations
1. AI lacks the innate ability to truly comprehend and empathize with human emotions.
2. AI doesn't possess the natural ability for teamwork that involves complex human interactions and relationships.
3.  Certain professions necessitate a level of human involvement that AI cannot replace, preserving the unique value of human touch.

### 9. @revanshupusadkar2631 (üëç 2)
Task 1 :-

Really love how you breakdown the video, at first you have explained the types and basics of AI which I didn't know but surely will help to make my prompt better and make me understand behind the AI & LLMs more efficiently. 
Not only this but I also get to know about the 3 AI models of claude which I'll try out for sure .
Also your checklist to write a prompt is so useful, I have been using some of the steps from it before for sure it'll help me to level up my prompt engineering game even more.
Lastly , your two golden advice  that ' Use AI as your first draft not last. ' & ' Let AI to crossover. ' are just to useful because I didn't know 2nd one.
So for the best video as it teaches you the logic behind using AI tool not how to use AI tool.
BTW love your authenticity ‚ù§

Task 2 :-

‚Ä¢ I think AI wasn't able to do Full Stack Web development right now because it includes Frontend and Backend as well and the most trickiest part would ve backend. My guess is that after 6-7 years AI will able to do 60%-70% of Full stack web development if the relevant prompt is given.
‚Ä¢Also, AI will not be able to managing itself like we need some experience individuals to handle and manage AI so that it didn't get out of our hands.
‚Ä¢Also AI will not be to take over the Data scientist & teacher.

Task 3 :-

This video is a game-changer for anyone looking to master AI tools. Your breakdown of prompt engineering is brilliant - I love how you emphasized the importance of giving context, setting clear goals, and providing examples. Can't wait for the next video!

### 11. @nainau6204 (üëç 0)
We need content creators like you to show AI is a knife and holder is still a well intentioned human. I saw a boy who is looking at a video in slum and teaching his parents about it. Being the food for the right kind of hungry and healthy and tasty one at it is what makes me come back to you often. Kudos to hours of thought put into bringing it out to people for free.

### 12. @hepihepihepii (üëç 13)
Task1: My learnings-
The very first thing we all need to understand that if we don't learn to use AI tools, then AI and people using AI will definitely get ahead of us in many ways. 
Talking about avoiding mistakes, which can affect our career are not having enough experience, which is mostly because we don't have the confidence to participate, or may be not being aware of the opportunities ( we need to keep ourself updated always, especially in today's times, it is very important), next is not having clear thinking or understanding each other, which is obviously because we are not that much in touch of the real world, that when an actual real problem arrives, we just don't know what do to.
Remember that AI, right now is not that advance, they do need human touch, to make that material more useable, relevant.
Always go for free versions if you're just starting, don't directly go for paid versions.
Just using AI won't make you different from others, mixing it with your own experiences, understanding and knowledge definitely will.
If you're using AI for content (any type of) writing, give a lot of examples of your own writing, that's how it will give you the most accurate result.
Task 2: My opinion on what AI can't do
Right now a lot of jobs are not going to get replaced by AI, and they basically include jobs that requires critical thinking, risk, presence of mind and factors like these, for example dentists, lawyers etc. 
They will get better eventually ( AGIs), but that is going to happen after so many years.

### 16. @sonaliaggarwal7808 (üëç 0)
Thank you ansh for this amazing insightful lecture. 
Task 1: Learnings from this course
Chapter1- What is AI
Ai is a manmade machine which learns and feeds on human experiences and data and then analyze patterns from it can generate results based on its understanding. If we feed good and high-quality material to AI then we get good results and vice-versa.
There are 6 subjects under AI:
1.	Machine learning- it learns and improves from experience or user history. E.g.: ChatGPT, Claude
2.	Deep Learning- similar to how humans learn by forming mental connections. It thinks more logically. E.g.: voice assistants like Siri ,Alexa. 
3.	Natural Language Processing- understands and analyses text and emotions behind it and helps in summarizing the text or answering questions related to it. 
4.	Computer vision- can look at images. E.g.: speed cameras, facial recognition systems. 

Chapter 2: Basics of Claude AI
Claude Ai has 3 models Haiku (free), Sonet (paid) and opus (paid).
A startup should use these AI models to help them build their own business and chatbots. 

Chapter 3: basis of prompt engineering 
Prompt engineering= context + constraints 
To write a good prompt means to  give AI full context of what you want the result to be like otherwise AI will assume you have unlimited resources and time. 
A good prompt should be structured as follows: 
1.	Assign a relevant role
2.	Set context 
3.	Set constraints
4.	Define expectations
Another way to become good at prompting is to ask ai to ask you relevant questions related to a topic and then you will know what to ask or frame your prompt. 




Task 2: What AI cannot do

Somethings which AI can never do are:
1.	Process human emotions. Ai can replicate or mimic emotions but can truly never know what emotions feel like or to tell them apart like difference between love or obsession, hate or anger, beautiful or ugly etc.
2.	AI cannot have a human like conversations. He is like the annoyed relative who answers only what you ask him, no more no less until and unless you tell it to ask you questions but it again feels like an interview than a conversation. 
3.	AI can never take over certain professions like that of a politician and run a country, a teacher, doctor, judges or lawyers, engineers, psychiatrists. 
It can assist them for research or automation purposes but cannot give advice from its own experiences. 


Task 3 : Use case with video shared on LinkedIn 
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sonali-aggarwal-03121998_i-watched-ansh-mehras-class-on-complete-activity-7191745131803254784-H6e9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

### 17. @kavitakhatri9248 (üëç 0)
Hey Ansh...your are doing a wonderful job. Your courses are not only for beginners but for intermediate designers as well.
Task 1: I have learned the basics of AI, LLM, Deep learning , NLM and how to use your best prompt to get the best result.
Task2
What AI Can't do?
1. Emotional: AI cannot have the emotional feeling to understand the pain point of the human.
2. Taking Decision: The AI have million of information but it can't have the ability to think and take a judgement and information required for particular condition.
For example : The AI gave you the generic information about the dog but it can't able to give the information of my personal dog.
3. Creativity: The power of human to create something new, to think, to act . It's not possible with AI. It will always the information which is already filled not new information or new creativity.

### 18. @NaazParween-v8y (üëç 0)
My learning experience from this video is that:-
4 Step checklist of AI:-
Assign a relevant role.
Set context.
Set constraints.
Define expectations .
another is that AI:-
Ai comprises machine learning, deep learning, LLM.
Learning about basics of Claud,chatbot, prompt enginnering,NLP etc. This masterclass is really fruitful for me.‚ù§‚ù§

### 19. @theurbanwatch (üëç 11)
Task 1: My top learnings from the video 
1. AI is a powerful tool that can be used to learn new things and complete tasks more efficiently. However, it is important to remember that AI is limited by the data it is trained on.
2.Claude is a new free AI tool that is not only faster but also more creative than ChatGPT.
3.Prompt engineering is the key to getting the most out of AI tools. By carefully crafting your prompts, you can get AI to generate more relevant and helpful responses.

Task 2: Three things that AI would never be able to replace 
1.Real-life experiences: AI is trained on data and can not replace the benefits of having real-life experiences. For example,  AI can not understand the nuances of human psychology because it can not experience the world in the same way that a human can. 
2.Clear thinking: AI can be very good at following patterns and completing tasks, but it cannot replace clear thinking. AI struggles to understand the reasoning behind human decisions because it cannot think critically in the same way that a human can.
3.Human touch/intervention: AI needs human intervention to navigate the real world. AI can be biased based on the data it is trained on, and humans are needed to identify and correct these biases. Additionally, AI cannot understand the subjective and emotional aspects of human communication.
Task 3: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zainab-qureshi-119b222a5_unleash-the-power-of-ai-for-learning-key-activity-7193853928319414273-llFL?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android
