[00:00 - 00:05]
That is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of

[00:04 - 00:09]
coffee. Welcome, welcome, welcome

[00:05 - 00:11]
everybody to another episode of Fantasy

[00:09 - 00:14]
News. I am your disheveled Goblin host,

[00:11 - 00:15]
Daniel Green. And today, I would like to

[00:14 - 00:17]
go ahead and just kick it off with a

[00:15 - 00:19]
little bit of a here are the plans for

[00:17 - 00:21]
the week update. Throughout the week and

[00:19 - 00:23]
maybe even early into next week, we are

[00:21 - 00:25]
going to be getting you an andor review,

[00:23 - 00:28]
the Old Kingdom review, the wandering in

[00:25 - 00:30]
review, a video about literary rejection

[00:28 - 00:33]
and what to do and how to handle it

[00:30 - 00:36]
before finally also delivering a Wheel

[00:33 - 00:38]
of Time autopsy, though I have no idea

[00:36 - 00:40]
what order those videos are going to be

[00:38 - 00:41]
put out in, to be honest. For the Wheel

[00:40 - 00:43]
of Time autopsy, we're going to be

[00:41 - 00:45]
getting into all different kinds of

[00:43 - 00:47]
angles of what possibly went wrong for

[00:45 - 00:49]
the show. Look at what we actually do

[00:47 - 00:51]
know for sure versus what is just fan

[00:49 - 00:53]
conjecture. And look at several

[00:51 - 00:55]
additional strange things that came out

[00:53 - 00:56]
while the show was actually being

[00:55 - 00:58]
announced that it was cancelled,

[00:56 - 01:01]
including Sony putting out right before

[00:58 - 01:03]
the announcement was released a video

[01:01 - 01:06]
that ended with this line. We are not

[01:03 - 01:08]
oath breakers. To be fair, I don't think

[01:06 - 01:10]
that was intentional. I don't actually

[01:08 - 01:12]
think they're trying to signal that this

[01:10 - 01:14]
was like Amazon's decision and not on

[01:12 - 01:16]
Sony's, but part of my brain's tickled

[01:14 - 01:18]
by it. And also, it's easier to make

[01:16 - 01:19]
Amazon the bad guy. Well, they make it

[01:18 - 01:21]
easy. And we'll get into the additional

[01:19 - 01:22]
things happening within the fandom, like

[01:21 - 01:25]
the fact that there's a revival campaign

[01:22 - 01:28]
going on. All of that to be thoroughly

[01:25 - 01:29]
looked at and examined, as well as a

[01:28 - 01:31]
rather ambitious additional announcement

[01:29 - 01:33]
that kind of is part of the reason why

[01:31 - 01:36]
there's so many videos coming so fast

[01:33 - 01:40]
here. But in this next story, I have

[01:36 - 01:43]
never been so happy to be wrong. Like

[01:40 - 01:45]
aggressively super duper wrong. But I'm

[01:43 - 01:47]
so thrilled that I was. And that is

[01:45 - 01:50]
because it has been confirmed that

[01:47 - 01:53]
actually it's true. An Alex Garland

[01:50 - 01:56]
directed Elden Ring movie is in the

[01:53 - 01:59]
works with A24's involvement alongside

[01:56 - 02:02]
Bandy Namco Entertainment. And there are

[01:59 - 02:05]
just so many fascinating ways an

[02:02 - 02:06]
adaptation of Elden Ring could be done.

[02:05 - 02:08]
Like I actually think you could even do

[02:06 - 02:10]
an adaptation of El Ring where you kind

[02:08 - 02:14]
of keep the silent protagonist angle.

[02:10 - 02:16]
Like this could be fascinating and I

[02:14 - 02:18]
actually like Alex Garland who's known

[02:16 - 02:20]
for kind of taking ambitious

[02:18 - 02:23]
storytelling approaches to things. Look

[02:20 - 02:26]
at Civil War. Uh being tapped to do it.

[02:23 - 02:30]
A long time A24 who's known to allow

[02:26 - 02:33]
people to experiment. This could be a

[02:30 - 02:36]
wild endeavor. And I hope they take a

[02:33 - 02:38]
lot of big swings. I would rather see an

[02:36 - 02:40]
Elder Ring movie that takes just

[02:38 - 02:43]
haymakers creatively trying to do

[02:40 - 02:46]
something really cool than plays it

[02:43 - 02:48]
safe. And I believe most fans of the

[02:46 - 02:51]
Souls franchises will agree with me on

[02:48 - 02:52]
that. I'm also just really curious to

[02:51 - 02:54]
hear what the budget will be, which I

[02:52 - 02:56]
know is kind of like a strange thing to

[02:54 - 02:59]
care about for a movie, but how are they

[02:56 - 03:02]
going to handle bringing such a vivid

[02:59 - 03:04]
world to life? My god, dumb Daniel

[03:02 - 03:06]
moment. I actually completely forgot

[03:04 - 03:09]
that Alex Garland is the writer director

[03:06 - 03:11]
behind both Xmachina and Annihilation,

[03:09 - 03:14]
the adaptation of Jeff Vanemir's book.

[03:11 - 03:18]
So for me, it it totally seems like he

[03:14 - 03:21]
as a director could absolutely nail the

[03:18 - 03:24]
more surreal tone that must permeate any

[03:21 - 03:26]
form of Elden Ring adaptation. And with

[03:24 - 03:30]
also having Civil War under his belt, he

[03:26 - 03:33]
has a proven resume for creating a wide

[03:30 - 03:34]
variety of monsters. Definitely watch

[03:33 - 03:37]
Annihilation for that if you have not

[03:34 - 03:40]
already. And oh, I am getting more

[03:37 - 03:42]
excited for this as I look into it. Just

[03:40 - 03:43]
for some of the visuals especially, I'd

[03:42 - 03:45]
like them to kind of take some notes for

[03:43 - 03:47]
the Green Knight, but I'm getting too

[03:45 - 03:49]
much into it. Let's just get pumped.

[03:47 - 03:52]
This is years off, but still really

[03:49 - 03:55]
cool. Hell yeah. And it also could be a

[03:52 - 03:57]
comedy. Hear me out. It could like

[03:55 - 03:59]
imagine one where they keep the constant

[03:57 - 04:01]
deaths and everything and it's like you

[03:59 - 04:02]
see the person stuck in the world rage

[04:01 - 04:04]
quitting. I hope they don't do that.

[04:02 - 04:06]
That's not the kind of haymaker I want,

[04:04 - 04:09]
but they could. Don't. It's a

[04:06 - 04:11]
possibility that won't happen. Me, this

[04:09 - 04:13]
is cool. This is my favorite story of

[04:11 - 04:16]
the day. Easily. I'm so glad I was

[04:13 - 04:17]
wrong. Yay. That's the frustration I

[04:16 - 04:18]
have with leaks, though, where it's like

[04:17 - 04:21]
something gets put out and you're like,

[04:18 - 04:23]
"Oh, no. Is that for sure Rizzles?" and

[04:21 - 04:25]
then you find out ah the person who

[04:23 - 04:26]
leaked it has been wrong before so you

[04:25 - 04:29]
have to air on the side of caution when

[04:26 - 04:31]
spreading news but then you actually are

[04:29 - 04:33]
proven that you should have [¬†__¬†] I also

[04:31 - 04:35]
want to acknowledge that yes there are

[04:33 - 04:37]
like new Witcher headlines floating

[04:35 - 04:39]
about that the show is officially

[04:37 - 04:41]
cancelled at Netflix after season 5

[04:39 - 04:43]
except we've known that for a year and

[04:41 - 04:44]
even covered it here on the channel. Uh,

[04:43 - 04:46]
the only thing that's kind of new with

[04:44 - 04:48]
that is a quote from the showrunner

[04:46 - 04:51]
that's saying like, "We've had time to

[04:48 - 04:53]
actually film a cathartic ending." And

[04:51 - 04:55]
yes, Liam Hemsworth will be getting two

[04:53 - 04:58]
seasons to bring The Witcher to life.

[04:55 - 05:00]
How nice. I'm glad that the fans of the

[04:58 - 05:01]
show that are still around uh will

[05:00 - 05:04]
actually be getting an ending that will

[05:01 - 05:06]
have some form of like conclusion.

[05:04 - 05:07]
Little bit jealous. Not sure why this is

[05:06 - 05:09]
popping up again, though. I guess maybe

[05:07 - 05:10]
as like a way to generate hype, though

[05:09 - 05:12]
that doesn't really make sense when

[05:10 - 05:15]
you're saying it's going to end. But

[05:12 - 05:19]
that is going to take us into the cover

[05:15 - 05:22]
reveals of the day and we have some

[05:19 - 05:24]
beautiful ones and largely the artist

[05:22 - 05:26]
has been credited hot diggity dog. Hot

[05:24 - 05:28]
diggity. What the hell's wrong with me?

[05:26 - 05:30]
We are going to start it off by taking a

[05:28 - 05:34]
look at the cover for Allesium Heist put

[05:30 - 05:38]
out by Solaris Books. The cover art was

[05:34 - 05:39]
by Amazing 15. And I'm we're in a day

[05:38 - 05:41]
and age of the internet where I have to

[05:39 - 05:44]
be like maybe that's their real name. I

[05:41 - 05:45]
don't know. And the cover itself, I kind

[05:44 - 05:47]
of like how they're clearly doing like a

[05:45 - 05:50]
roulette table, but as like a celestial

[05:47 - 05:52]
entity in the sky. Creative, neat, and

[05:50 - 05:55]
the pastel

[05:52 - 05:57]
colors pretty. And the synopsis reads,

[05:55 - 05:59]
"Saleom Shipman is a dazzler, a hostess

[05:57 - 06:02]
working on the gaming floors of the

[05:59 - 06:05]
Allesium, the galaxy's most decadent

[06:02 - 06:07]
space casino. But she is also a prisoner

[06:05 - 06:09]
to the debt she inherited from her

[06:07 - 06:11]
deadbeat father with years of service

[06:09 - 06:15]
ahead of her until she can earn her way

[06:11 - 06:17]
out. Kiimora Goldwaver is a disgraced

[06:15 - 06:19]
Harris looking to rescue her family

[06:17 - 06:21]
business with an audacious scheme to rob

[06:19 - 06:24]
the casino. To pull it off, she needs

[06:21 - 06:26]
Salma on board. When they team up, it

[06:24 - 06:29]
looks like a simple job until Salma

[06:26 - 06:32]
meets Ilario, the jewel in Kio's master

[06:29 - 06:34]
plan and sparks begin to fly. With a

[06:32 - 06:36]
recovering alcoholic card counter and

[06:34 - 06:37]
Salma's little sister, who happens to be

[06:36 - 06:39]
dating the Allesium's artificial

[06:37 - 06:42]
intelligence as part of the crew, they

[06:39 - 06:45]
might still beat the odds or learn that

[06:42 - 06:48]
the house always wins. Ooh, that stinger

[06:45 - 06:50]
at the end. And this is by YM Resnik and

[06:48 - 06:52]
this will be coming out November. I have

[06:50 - 06:54]
a feeling that cover will specifically

[06:52 - 06:56]
look great in hardback. I have no idea

[06:54 - 06:58]
why I think that. Man, they even have

[06:56 - 07:00]
the ball like orbiting the That's cool.

[06:58 - 07:03]
But this is going to take us to a cover

[07:00 - 07:06]
reveal from a big name in the fantasy

[07:03 - 07:10]
space and that is going to be for Naomi

[07:06 - 07:12]
Novik and her cover for the summer war

[07:10 - 07:14]
kept very minimal kind of just

[07:12 - 07:16]
highlighting an incredibly beautiful

[07:14 - 07:18]
drawing of an instrument with a sword

[07:16 - 07:20]
actually built in to the neck. I kind of

[07:18 - 07:22]
like that. That's a good like way to

[07:20 - 07:23]
present in like just a pretty way. What

[07:22 - 07:26]
do you think of this? This is how I play

[07:23 - 07:30]
this instrument. This is coming from Del

[07:26 - 07:32]
Ray Books and had cover art by on screen

[07:30 - 07:34]
now cuz I thought they credited it. They

[07:32 - 07:35]
haven't. I'm going to look for it in

[07:34 - 07:38]
post. And no release date has been

[07:35 - 07:40]
announced for this Novik book. I almost

[07:38 - 07:42]
said Novikn Nook, but that wouldn't have

[07:40 - 07:45]
worked. But our final cover reveal of

[07:42 - 07:49]
the day is going to come from Orbit

[07:45 - 07:52]
Books and it is for Outlaw Planet by MR

[07:49 - 07:56]
Kerry. The million copy selling author

[07:52 - 07:58]
has her cover design being done by Meg

[07:56 - 08:02]
Shepard. Outlaw Planet synopsis reads,

[07:58 - 08:04]
"This is the story of Bess or Dog Bess

[08:02 - 08:07]
as she came to be known. It's the story

[08:04 - 08:10]
of the gun she carried whose name was

[08:07 - 08:12]
Wakeful Slim. It's the story of the dead

[08:10 - 08:14]
man who carried that gun before her and

[08:12 - 08:16]
left a piece of himself inside of it.

[08:14 - 08:19]
And it's the tale of how she turned from

[08:16 - 08:20]
teacher to renegade and ultimately to

[08:19 - 08:23]
hero. And you can pre-order this book

[08:20 - 08:25]
starting July 25th. Now, for this next

[08:23 - 08:27]
story, I'm going to be rewinding us

[08:25 - 08:29]
through the past until we've reached

[08:27 - 08:31]
just around the time the Game of Thrones

[08:29 - 08:34]
show ended. Why? Well, we have gotten an

[08:31 - 08:36]
update to the story around the stunt

[08:34 - 08:38]
performer who was injured on set,

[08:36 - 08:41]
including details of just how much they

[08:38 - 08:43]
were paid for the careerending injury

[08:41 - 08:45]
and what they have to say about it all

[08:43 - 08:47]
these years later in an interview with

[08:45 - 08:49]
Deadline because she wanted to talk

[08:47 - 08:50]
about what is wrong in the stunt

[08:49 - 08:52]
profession currently, including the fact

[08:50 - 08:54]
that the stunt coordinator who was in

[08:52 - 08:56]
charge when the injury happened

[08:54 - 09:00]
continues to deny responsibility despite

[08:56 - 09:03]
HBO admitting liability. At 27 in

[09:00 - 09:05]
February of 2018, she suffered an injury

[09:03 - 09:07]
on set that resulted in her getting paid

[09:05 - 09:10]
$9.3

[09:07 - 09:12]
million from HBO, included with an

[09:10 - 09:14]
apology from the company's lawyers. And

[09:12 - 09:16]
Deadline has uncovered at least two

[09:14 - 09:19]
other incidents under this same stunt

[09:16 - 09:22]
coordinator Rowley's watch that predated

[09:19 - 09:24]
Michael's injury, including a similar

[09:22 - 09:26]
incident in an earlier season of Game of

[09:24 - 09:28]
Thrones. Erlam is still working on the

[09:26 - 09:30]
Game of Thrones franchise, even

[09:28 - 09:32]
currently working on season 3 of House

[09:30 - 09:34]
of the Dragon. The specific issue that

[09:32 - 09:36]
Michaels is taking a larger swing at is

[09:34 - 09:39]
the fact that there has been no

[09:36 - 09:41]
independent examination of Ilam's

[09:39 - 09:43]
competency as a coordinator. And while

[09:41 - 09:45]
they do belong to the British Stunt

[09:43 - 09:48]
Registry, that body does not have the

[09:45 - 09:49]
power to investigate members or log

[09:48 - 09:51]
accidents. When it comes to Michael's

[09:49 - 09:54]
actual injury on set that happened all

[09:51 - 09:56]
those years ago, they recall the fact

[09:54 - 09:57]
that the stunt coordinator Erlam was

[09:56 - 09:59]
telling people as they fell from a high

[09:57 - 10:01]
wall that they could not spot their

[09:59 - 10:03]
landings because they were zombies and

[10:01 - 10:06]
not to look down as they fell, telling

[10:03 - 10:07]
performers to drop like a pencil. And

[10:06 - 10:09]
despite three other individuals

[10:07 - 10:11]
cooperating this testimony, Erlam denies

[10:09 - 10:13]
this. And in addition to that, between

[10:11 - 10:15]
takes, the thicker mats they were

[10:13 - 10:17]
falling on were swapped with thinner

[10:15 - 10:19]
ones without anyone being warned. So

[10:17 - 10:22]
essentially, Michaelels was told to fall

[10:19 - 10:24]
blindly onto a rig from a high height

[10:22 - 10:26]
that had been changed without telling

[10:24 - 10:29]
her, meaning she had no way to know how

[10:26 - 10:29]
to adjust.

[10:36 - 10:39]
[Applause]

[10:40 - 10:46]
[Music]

[10:44 - 10:48]
[Applause]

[10:46 - 10:52]
against.

[10:48 - 10:52]
[Music]

[11:00 - 11:07]
[Music]

[11:08 - 11:11]
Nine other stunt experts have cooporated

[11:10 - 11:14]
Michael's conclusion that the landing

[11:11 - 11:16]
rig was unsuitable, including Simon

[11:14 - 11:18]
Crane, a vastly experienced stunt man

[11:16 - 11:19]
known for James Bond and Cliffhanger.

[11:18 - 11:21]
And when it further comes to the culture

[11:19 - 11:23]
on set, apparently 2 months after her

[11:21 - 11:27]
injury took place, Casey Michaels was

[11:23 - 11:29]
asked to contribute 300 for a gift watch

[11:27 - 11:31]
to the stunt coordinator in charge of

[11:29 - 11:33]
the set when she got injured. And while

[11:31 - 11:35]
it was told to her that it would not

[11:33 - 11:36]
affect her future employment, she did

[11:35 - 11:38]
not believe that was true. And

[11:36 - 11:41]
eventually, yes, the stunt quarter was

[11:38 - 11:44]
given a watch valued at over ¬£24,000

[11:41 - 11:46]
as well as other gifts. It is alleged

[11:44 - 11:48]
this comes after stunt coordinators were

[11:46 - 11:51]
explicitly told not to take gifts

[11:48 - 11:53]
exceeding $25 in value. And while HBO

[11:51 - 11:54]
initially did claim that the injury was

[11:53 - 11:57]
caused by Casey Michael's own

[11:54 - 12:00]
negligence, remember their lawyers have

[11:57 - 12:02]
paid out over $9 million and included an

[12:00 - 12:04]
apology. But still, Aram continues to

[12:02 - 12:07]
work on HBO Productions. And this

[12:04 - 12:09]
article goes far deeper into just how

[12:07 - 12:11]
everything went so horribly wrong. I

[12:09 - 12:14]
would say like a perfect storm that

[12:11 - 12:15]
often implies like an accident when if

[12:14 - 12:18]
you look at the level of negligence on

[12:15 - 12:20]
display here, it is shocking. Especially

[12:18 - 12:22]
included with the fact that Erlam still

[12:20 - 12:24]
continues to deny everything despite so

[12:22 - 12:27]
many industry experts saying like, "No,

[12:24 - 12:29]
you did a terrible job." And HBO

[12:27 - 12:31]
admitting fault and paying out a

[12:29 - 12:32]
multi-million dollar settlement. And I

[12:31 - 12:34]
personally think this is pretty

[12:32 - 12:38]
important to cover here in Fantasy News

[12:34 - 12:41]
because yes, we as SFFF fans really

[12:38 - 12:43]
enjoy the spectacle behind our shows and

[12:41 - 12:45]
the over-the-top, you know, literal

[12:43 - 12:48]
otherworldliness they can achieve. But

[12:45 - 12:50]
oftent times, especially when it comes

[12:48 - 12:52]
to stunt performers, there is risk

[12:50 - 12:53]
involved in that. And I absolutely think

[12:52 - 12:56]
stunt performers should be allowed to do

[12:53 - 12:57]
what they do. It's an incredible literal

[12:56 - 13:01]
art form that they have to put their

[12:57 - 13:04]
bodies on the line to achieve.

[13:01 - 13:06]
but it needs to be cracked down on. I

[13:04 - 13:07]
love the fact that in 2027 we're

[13:06 - 13:09]
apparently going to be getting a stunt

[13:07 - 13:12]
Oscar and I think it's insulting to

[13:09 - 13:13]
performers to somehow imply that this is

[13:12 - 13:16]
going to motivate them to be even

[13:13 - 13:18]
riskier. They are professionals and they

[13:16 - 13:20]
should know better. But if people who

[13:18 - 13:23]
continue to deny fault responsibility

[13:20 - 13:25]
despite repeated patterns of behavior in

[13:23 - 13:28]
previous accidents on record for them

[13:25 - 13:30]
that have been in similar situations and

[13:28 - 13:32]
they continue to be stunt coordinators,

[13:30 - 13:34]
then I start to get a bit nervous. I

[13:32 - 13:37]
have a huge love for stunt performers. I

[13:34 - 13:40]
think they are brilliant, brave, and

[13:37 - 13:41]
crazy in the best way. But the people in

[13:40 - 13:44]
charge of their safety need to have the

[13:41 - 13:47]
highest standards applied to them. I

[13:44 - 13:48]
believe that absolutely.

[13:47 - 13:51]
And I would encourage you more than any

[13:48 - 13:52]
other story today to go read the full

[13:51 - 13:54]
write up from Deadline about how

[13:52 - 13:56]
everything went wrong and how this

[13:54 - 13:59]
really could have been prevented because

[13:56 - 14:01]
holy crap. Uh I personally would have

[13:59 - 14:03]
been like, "No, even as a stunt

[14:01 - 14:06]
performer, I'm not going to jump on a

[14:03 - 14:08]
pile of boxes with a bunch of other

[14:06 - 14:10]
people when the mat has been swapped out

[14:08 - 14:12]
for something thinner and it's not even

[14:10 - 14:14]
told to me and we're being told to drop

[14:12 - 14:17]
like pencils on top of each other. Are

[14:14 - 14:19]
you kidding me? That is disrespecting

[14:17 - 14:21]
the craft these people do. And I'm

[14:19 - 14:23]
thrilled that for this next story, I

[14:21 - 14:26]
actually get to do a rare thing here in

[14:23 - 14:28]
Fantasy News and go, "Awesome. Good job,

[14:26 - 14:32]
big company. I like what you're doing."

[14:28 - 14:36]
And that is because Warhammer 40k Makers

[14:32 - 14:39]
Games Workshop is giving its staff a $27

[14:36 - 14:41]
million bonus due to how well the

[14:39 - 14:43]
company has been doing. and getting into

[14:41 - 14:46]
how much money they've made. God damn,

[14:43 - 14:48]
Warhammer continues to be a huge deal. I

[14:46 - 14:50]
did not know it was this big. Game

[14:48 - 14:52]
Workshop has confirmed that as of June

[14:50 - 14:56]
1st, 2025, the core revenue over the

[14:52 - 14:58]
last year for them is going to be ¬£560

[14:56 - 15:02]
million, up from

[14:58 - 15:04]
¬£494.7 million previous year. Their year

[15:02 - 15:06]
being like ending June, you know what I

[15:04 - 15:08]
mean? You get basic company financial

[15:06 - 15:11]
year crap with their core profit in that

[15:08 - 15:13]
time being 210 million. My god. The

[15:11 - 15:15]
money is going on an equal basis to each

[15:13 - 15:16]
staff member. And apparently this is not

[15:15 - 15:18]
the first time they've even done

[15:16 - 15:20]
something like this. With the last

[15:18 - 15:23]
period they gave away $18 million. But

[15:20 - 15:26]
that means each of their 1500 staff this

[15:23 - 15:29]
year will be getting roughly a 13,000

[15:26 - 15:30]
bonus. I love this company. Holy [¬†__¬†]

[15:29 - 15:31]
And I'm sure someone's going to be

[15:30 - 15:33]
letting me know there's something crappy

[15:31 - 15:36]
this company has done in the comments

[15:33 - 15:39]
below. But I also do believe in praising

[15:36 - 15:41]
when a company in a capitalist system

[15:39 - 15:44]
does something genuinely awesome for its

[15:41 - 15:46]
employees. And in this case, turns out

[15:44 - 15:48]
that the franchise that's largely built

[15:46 - 15:51]
around criticizing like authoritarian

[15:48 - 15:53]
monsters and stuff like that uh actually

[15:51 - 15:56]
tends to give a [¬†__¬†] about its

[15:53 - 15:58]
employees. I love that. Good job. But

[15:56 - 16:00]
from here, we are going to actually take

[15:58 - 16:02]
a look at moving from leaks to official

[16:00 - 16:05]
releases once again. And that is because

[16:02 - 16:07]
the Ball Rock Lego set after the leak we

[16:05 - 16:10]
covered last week has had its official

[16:07 - 16:12]
photos released. And yep, it looks

[16:10 - 16:15]
exactly like what we saw, just in better

[16:12 - 16:16]
presentation. Now, to be fair, I think

[16:15 - 16:18]
this looks fine, and you could

[16:16 - 16:20]
definitely make it look great on a shelf

[16:18 - 16:22]
with some effort. But I I think you

[16:20 - 16:23]
could have done better. I don't know.

[16:22 - 16:25]
There's something about like the hollow

[16:23 - 16:28]
approach to it with the very thin

[16:25 - 16:30]
rounded ends that it just doesn't work

[16:28 - 16:32]
entirely for me. It's a great scene.

[16:30 - 16:33]
It's done well enough and I think it's

[16:32 - 16:35]
going to look really good on a lot of

[16:33 - 16:36]
people's Lord of the Rings shrines.

[16:35 - 16:40]
Let's be real, a lot of y'all have that.

[16:36 - 16:41]
But am I tickled to buy right away? Nah,

[16:40 - 16:43]
especially not with the cost of Legos

[16:41 - 16:46]
these days. And this is going to take us

[16:43 - 16:48]
to our favorite reoccurring segment here

[16:46 - 16:50]
in fantasy news. And that is because a

[16:48 - 16:53]
fantasy romance author is being called

[16:50 - 16:56]
out for being so sloppy with their book

[16:53 - 16:59]
that they left an AI prompt within the

[16:56 - 17:01]
text. No, I'm not kidding. Oh, the

[16:59 - 17:04]
prompt reading. I've written the passage

[17:01 - 17:05]
to align more with J Breeze style which

[17:04 - 17:08]
features more tension, gritty

[17:05 - 17:10]
undertones, and raw emotion subtext

[17:08 - 17:12]
beneath the supernatural elements, which

[17:10 - 17:14]
if you are unaware with Chacht, uh if

[17:12 - 17:16]
you say, "Hey, please do this." It'll at

[17:14 - 17:18]
the end of it be like, "Here is what

[17:16 - 17:20]
I've done for the prompt you released."

[17:18 - 17:23]
And so this person clearly like copy and

[17:20 - 17:26]
pasted directly in without even

[17:23 - 17:27]
bothering to check. And they're just

[17:26 - 17:32]
telling Chat GPT to steal another

[17:27 - 17:34]
author's style. I Oh my god. Though the

[17:32 - 17:36]
ebook has been quietly edited to remove

[17:34 - 17:38]
this part. And who knows if this

[17:36 - 17:39]
person's even real. They could just be

[17:38 - 17:41]
an author pseudonym and that name will

[17:39 - 17:43]
disappear forever and they pop back up

[17:41 - 17:45]
under a new one because accountability

[17:43 - 17:47]
is gone. There's no accountability

[17:45 - 17:50]
anymore. And there are arguments to be

[17:47 - 17:52]
made with certain levels of chat GPT or

[17:50 - 17:54]
AI touching your text if you have

[17:52 - 17:57]
disabilities or you can't afford an

[17:54 - 18:01]
editor of any kind. I personally do not

[17:57 - 18:04]
have an issue with you using chat GPT to

[18:01 - 18:06]
do basic grammar punctuation stuff.

[18:04 - 18:09]
Okay, I can accept that. But there's a

[18:06 - 18:11]
spectrum, and this is so far on the

[18:09 - 18:13]
other end of being like, "Steal this

[18:11 - 18:16]
author's style to make my writing

[18:13 - 18:18]
better." Ah, that's right, Lena. You end

[18:16 - 18:21]
up getting a whiteboard segment of your

[18:18 - 18:22]
own. Congratulations, or whoever you

[18:21 - 18:26]
really are, and your real name is

[18:22 - 18:29]
because I want to talk about why we love

[18:26 - 18:32]
reading books and what makes this medium

[18:29 - 18:35]
pretty special. Uh, it's extraordinarily

[18:32 - 18:40]
hard. You as an individual have to use

[18:35 - 18:44]
the tool that is language to create a

[18:40 - 18:47]
story and it needs to convey a thousand

[18:44 - 18:50]
different things coming together that we

[18:47 - 18:53]
through the medium of storytelling come

[18:50 - 18:57]
to understand a greater meaning. And

[18:53 - 18:59]
this happens from authors who are just

[18:57 - 19:01]
brilliant. Like they're able to make you

[18:59 - 19:03]
actually re-evaluate yourself, your life

[19:01 - 19:06]
through their word choices in their

[19:03 - 19:09]
stories, the themes that they exercise,

[19:06 - 19:12]
patterns that tickle your brain to end

[19:09 - 19:16]
up mastering

[19:12 - 19:19]
art. What did you do? Well, you saw an

[19:16 - 19:22]
author that actually managed to make

[19:19 - 19:25]
art. you decided that whatever your

[19:22 - 19:28]
meaningless story is uh just should be

[19:25 - 19:29]
in that style without any thought or

[19:28 - 19:32]
care of whether or not you're going to

[19:29 - 19:34]
develop your own art form and skills in

[19:32 - 19:37]
this. And then you shhat something out

[19:34 - 19:40]
to try and make money. And I'm sorry,

[19:37 - 19:44]
that doesn't make you an author. That

[19:40 - 19:49]
makes you the lowest form of individual

[19:44 - 19:52]
on the internet. You are a content

[19:49 - 19:55]
creator and not even an original good

[19:52 - 19:58]
one. You're a content creator that

[19:55 - 20:01]
steals. That's so sad. And you are

[19:58 - 20:05]
exactly what's wrong with this

[20:01 - 20:08]
proliferation of AI into art because

[20:05 - 20:12]
these people say like, "Well, the AI

[20:08 - 20:14]
can make the thing, therefore it good."

[20:12 - 20:16]
Uh, guess what? Art's not about making

[20:14 - 20:19]
titties look good in whatever you're

[20:16 - 20:23]
having Chat GPT pump out. It's about

[20:19 - 20:25]
trying to look at someone's talent, how

[20:23 - 20:28]
they've improved what they're doing, and

[20:25 - 20:30]
be inspired, maybe even able to

[20:28 - 20:33]
communicate in a way that just words

[20:30 - 20:36]
can't evoke emotion.

[20:33 - 20:40]
What you're doing is contributing to

[20:36 - 20:44]
this replacing this and

[20:40 - 20:45]
it'sing repugnant because your flaws,

[20:44 - 20:48]
your

[20:45 - 20:51]
idiosyncrasies, all of those things will

[20:48 - 20:53]
make you actually stand out and better

[20:51 - 20:56]
and represent the fact that you have a

[20:53 - 20:59]
soul. And I would almost feel bad for

[20:56 - 21:03]
this specific author for getting swept

[20:59 - 21:05]
up in the same trap and being exposed in

[21:03 - 21:08]
such an embarrassing way, except for the

[21:05 - 21:12]
fact that they didn't just do it in

[21:08 - 21:16]
practice. They actually put out a book

[21:12 - 21:20]
that was deliberately stealing someone's

[21:16 - 21:24]
style. an author's voice, an author's

[21:20 - 21:27]
years of practice, not using any of

[21:24 - 21:31]
this, their actual effort. You are

[21:27 - 21:34]
trying to just take and ride into

[21:31 - 21:37]
success and you put it out and monetized

[21:34 - 21:39]
it. Shame. And I'm sad to say that AI's

[21:37 - 21:42]
proliferation is of course not just

[21:39 - 21:44]
constrained to authors who can disappear

[21:42 - 21:46]
and reappear and is also infecting the

[21:44 - 21:48]
quality of billion-dollar franchises

[21:46 - 21:50]
because we got a new Jurassic Park

[21:48 - 21:53]
Rebirth or whatever they're calling it

[21:50 - 21:55]
poster. And here it is. Take a look.

[21:53 - 21:57]
Aside from just looking generally

[21:55 - 21:59]
terrible, I'd like to zoom in on

[21:57 - 22:02]
specifically this dinosaur's feet. Uh,

[21:59 - 22:04]
yes, it grabbing this rock looks shitty.

[22:02 - 22:06]
But let's take a look at this foot

[22:04 - 22:09]
versus this foot. Have you noticed the

[22:06 - 22:10]
problem yet? Uh-huh. There's a different

[22:09 - 22:13]
number of toes. There's also a whole lot

[22:10 - 22:17]
of wonkiness happening with ScarJoe. Her

[22:13 - 22:20]
face, the rope. It's just wildly awful.

[22:17 - 22:22]
And I cannot stress enough, this is a

[22:20 - 22:25]
billiondoll franchise, and they'd rather

[22:22 - 22:27]
put this out than pay an artist. A

[22:25 - 22:30]
franchise, I remind you, that has one of

[22:27 - 22:34]
the most iconic posters of all time in

[22:30 - 22:36]
its catalog. But not all hope is dead

[22:34 - 22:39]
for the future of science fiction

[22:36 - 22:42]
because hey, the Dune franchise is going

[22:39 - 22:45]
pretty well, and a new spin-off has been

[22:42 - 22:46]
announced ahead of its movie comeback.

[22:45 - 22:47]
At least that's how Screen Rant is

[22:46 - 22:50]
phrasing it. And that is with the

[22:47 - 22:53]
announcement of Dune, Edge of the Crease

[22:50 - 22:55]
Knife, Rage of Shy Helude. And this is

[22:53 - 22:58]
going to be a comic with Brian Herbert

[22:55 - 23:01]
and Kevin J. Anderson pinning the story

[22:58 - 23:04]
with artists Andrea Scalmazi and

[23:01 - 23:05]
Francesco Moselli handling the art. The

[23:04 - 23:08]
synopsis reads, "It's a battle of

[23:05 - 23:11]
generations as Mate's son Samos launches

[23:08 - 23:14]
a bold assault against Baron Harbulu

[23:11 - 23:17]
Haronean, son of Dmitri, to bring down

[23:14 - 23:18]
the heavily fortified Haronean outpost.

[23:17 - 23:21]
The Freeman will need a tool of

[23:18 - 23:23]
unimaginable destruction, Shy Holude,

[23:21 - 23:26]
the mighty Sandworms." I will let the

[23:23 - 23:28]
hardcore Dune fans that have gotten to

[23:26 - 23:30]
Brian Herbert's books decide how excited

[23:28 - 23:32]
they are for about this because I

[23:30 - 23:34]
stopped with Frank Herbert's and I will

[23:32 - 23:36]
not be continuing from there just

[23:34 - 23:38]
because of how many people have told me

[23:36 - 23:42]
don't. And today's indie pub promo is

[23:38 - 23:44]
Guild of Tokens by John Hourbach pitched

[23:42 - 23:46]
as an epic new twist on conventional

[23:44 - 23:48]
urban fantasy for those who like

[23:46 - 23:51]
determined heroins, gritty cityscapes,

[23:48 - 23:53]
and strange magic. Jen Jacob's nights

[23:51 - 23:55]
are spent traversing a strange city,

[23:53 - 23:57]
finding hidden objects, slaying dragons,

[23:55 - 23:59]

11:30 I work in the film industry. What people don‚Äôt understand about the power dynamics on set is that every little thing you do contributes to your future career and how you get hired for your next show. That‚Äôs why there is so much ass-kissing in the industry. ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt impact your future employment‚Äù meaning they might not put you on a blacklist sure (which is closer to shadow banning someone on social media), but that also doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not gonna go with someone else next time. The people above the line remember that minimum wage PA that refused to risk their health and safety to do something inconsequential for a producer, and there are a hundred other replacement PA‚Äôs that are willing to give up their basic human decency instead. This is what breeds the toxicity and resentment and lack of respect we find all too often in the industry

### 9. @jjrusso664 (üëç 314)
The thing that irritates me the most about gen AI is the ENTITLEMENT behind it. AI prompt generators feel entitled to the years of hard work from creatives and it's honestly just mind blowing. They feel entitled to others creative labor, they are too lazy to put in any effort themselves, and then they use that stolen creative labor as a just another grift and insist on being called "artists" as if they aren't just another grifter.

Edit: If you think that AI is not "stealing" then idk what to tell you. Gen AI was trained by scraping creative works WITHOUT THE CONSENT of the people who created it. If that is not stealing, I don't know what is.

> **@haflaen** (üëç 33): What‚Äôs worse is how they then try and put a progressive spin on it by saying ‚Äúthese tools mean anyone can be an artist, art is no longer the domain of the privileged few‚Äù etc. It‚Äôs an insult not just to the great artists who‚Äôve spent years honing their craft, but also to beginning artists who maybe aren‚Äôt that talented but are still genuinely pouring their heart and soul into what they do. Because you‚Äôre saying to them that they shouldn‚Äôt bother developing their craft and becoming the artists they‚Äôve always wanted to be, because they can just have a machine regurgitate someone else‚Äôs art. It‚Äôs saying that art is solely about the destination, not the journey it takes to get there.

> **@CliffHanger413** (üëç 12): @@jjrusso664 I‚Äôm also fairly critical of LLMs and their proponents; however, I disagree regarding the entitlement.

In my experience, most of the people who use things like generative ML for image generation think along the lines of: ‚ÄúOh, this new tech is fun and cool, I‚Äôm going to play with it and maybe use it for some projects.‚Äù

(I think the sort of people you‚Äôre talking about‚Äîpeople who claim to be artists‚Äîare a small minority.)

On the other hand, I believe that arguments from the other side often come from a place of (possibly earned) entitlement: ‚ÄúBecause I had to work hard to achieve the capability I have in art, others should be confined to the same route. I‚Äôm entitled to a high barrier-to-entry for decent quality art.‚Äù

The argument against genAI shouldn‚Äôt be about how lazy the users are for using it, it should be about whether the training data was ethically sourced.

> **@Tinahgirl83** (üëç 9): ‚Å†@@CliffHanger413I think it should be about both. No matter how you slice it, the majority of people using gen AI are using it either to avoid having to practice their own skills (which takes time) or to cut corners in order to produce work faster. Both of those are lazy, either on behalf of the non-artist or on behalf of the person paying the non-artist because they‚Äôre too impatient to wait for someone to actually draw/paint something. When you won‚Äôt work at something, you‚Äôre lazy. Laziness is defined as being unwilling to work on something. A massive number of AI artists use it because it can do something that it would take them time to learn. 

It‚Äôs not elitist to say they aren‚Äôt artists/writers/musicians. It‚Äôs a statement of fact. What they ARE, is good with computer programs. Having a program pull stuff from all over the web and mash it together into something isn‚Äôt art. It‚Äôs computer work. That would be like me coloring in a coloring book page and getting mad when people said I wasn‚Äôt an artist. Or taking a painting out of a museum and claiming it as my own work because I went through the trouble of having to get the ladder, take the painting down and carry it out of the museum. 

If I applied it to writing, I‚Äôd say that filling in Mad Libs (I‚Äôm showing my ageüòÖ) makes me a writer. Or that I can take credit for a novel because I drove to a bookstore and got said novel. Ludicrous, right? I wouldn‚Äôt be an artist or writer, I‚Äôd be an art thief or plagiarizer. And that‚Äôs what gen AI users are. Thieves and plagiarizers. They haven‚Äôt done the work of actually writing or drawing anything. They haven‚Äôt worked at the process to improve. They put some search words or suggestions in a program and let it scour thousands of other people‚Äôs work to produce something soulless. Again, great with computers. But not artists. An artist is defined as ‚Äúa person who produces paintings or drawings as a profession or hobby,‚Äù or , ‚Äúa person who practices any of the various creative arts, such as a sculptor, novelist, poet, or filmmaker.‚Äù

I guess if you want to use it as a complementary statement, like you would say someone is great at the art of cooking, you could, but gen AI work isn‚Äôt good enough to merit that usage, in my opinion. It‚Äôs pretty sometimes, yes, but hollow and lifeless. And AI writing is even worse.

Also, people who earned the right, through thousands of hours of work and practice and failures and tears, to call themselves artist or writers aren‚Äôt suffering from a sense of entitlement. They put the work in. They EARNED the right to be called artists. Gen AI users are most definitely entitled, because they want to be called something they haven‚Äôt put in the work to be called.

> **@jjrusso664** (üëç 11): @@CliffHanger413 I get what you're saying, but I respectfully disagree. Gen AI works because it stole works from creatives. I do not know what else to call it other than entitlement. People are using Gen AI to write a book, which is only possible because work was stolen from creatives, and then turn a profit. If that isn't the feeling entitlement to others works, I don't know what it is. But maybe it's less entitlement and more the lack of respect for creative labor?

Edit: typos

> **@jorgefaulmann544** (üëç 3): ‚Äã@@jjrusso664 Lack of respect? Yes. Entitlement? No. I think you are all taking a much harder stance to defend. Even if you like it or not, a writer is someone who writes. An artist is someone who makes art. How good the result is, or how much effort was put into it is irrelevant. Now, the argument that the data used to train the AI was stolen is much stronger and much easier to defend. Thats the argument you should focus on, because it is the less emotional one.

How does the use of Ai effect readers trust in self published authors? Are we potentially seeing the beginning of the reading community regressing back to the big 5, even before the self published space was able to acquire a true seat at the table?

> **@Marshmellow3971** (üëç 3): It‚Äôs going to be hard to trust that anyone isn‚Äôt using AI going forward.

Why are so many people talking about an Elden Ring movie as if it's going to be based on the present day content of the game, rather than a film that takes place in the past?  Like, a story that takes place during or before The Shattering makes the most sense.

> **@YoYoRacketeer** (üëç 3): As we know, Martin wrote the backstory/worldbuilding of the game‚Äôs story, not the  playable story itself. Since Martin is producing the film, I could very well imagine they‚Äôd explore backstory lore instead of the game‚Äôs story, like you said.
