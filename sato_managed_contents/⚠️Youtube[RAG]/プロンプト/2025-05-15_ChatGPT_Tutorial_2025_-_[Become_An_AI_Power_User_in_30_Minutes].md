## Â≠óÂπï

[00:00 - 00:03]
Hey everyone, welcome to the channel. My

[00:01 - 00:04]
name is Mike and in this tutorial, I'm

[00:03 - 00:06]
going to show you how to go from

[00:04 - 00:08]
beginner to expert with one of the most

[00:06 - 00:10]
powerful tools on the internet right

[00:08 - 00:12]
now, Chat GPT. Once you master this

[00:10 - 00:13]
it's honestly like having a team of

[00:12 - 00:15]
geniuses who just work for you all the

[00:13 - 00:17]
time. And AI is changing rapidly. So

[00:15 - 00:19]
whether you've never used it or if you

[00:17 - 00:20]
use it every day, I believe this video

[00:19 - 00:23]
will show you some new ways to unlock

[00:20 - 00:25]
Chat GPT's full potential and

[00:23 - 00:27]
incrementally upgrade your life. So, in

[00:25 - 00:29]
this video, I have 16 prompts that

[00:27 - 00:31]
gradually increase in complexity from a

[00:29 - 00:32]
simple beginner command all the way to

[00:31 - 00:35]
some really advanced stuff that you

[00:32 - 00:37]
could use to become a real power user.

[00:35 - 00:39]
So, perhaps this could save you money by

[00:37 - 00:40]
not needing to hire an expert. Maybe

[00:39 - 00:42]
this can make a contract if you're a

[00:40 - 00:44]
landlord. This could help you find some

[00:42 - 00:46]
recipes to save some food in your fridge

[00:44 - 00:48]
that you're otherwise going to throw

[00:46 - 00:49]
away. Or maybe you could use this to

[00:48 - 00:51]
you know, write songs that you're going

[00:49 - 00:52]
to play at an open mic or anything like

[00:51 - 00:54]
that. So, this is extremely extremely

[00:52 - 00:56]
powerful and even as somebody who has

[00:54 - 00:59]
used it every single day since it came

[00:56 - 01:00]
out, I'm still often surprised by what

[00:59 - 01:02]
it can do. So, to get started, you're

[01:00 - 01:04]
going to go to

[01:02 - 01:05]
chatgpt.com, hit enter. It'll take you

[01:04 - 01:07]
to a page that looks something like

[01:05 - 01:09]
this. I recommend creating an account so

[01:07 - 01:10]
that you can access this from other

[01:09 - 01:12]
devices and it can remember everything

[01:10 - 01:14]
you've done for future references. So

[01:12 - 01:16]
you can do that by clicking login or

[01:14 - 01:17]
sign up on the top right. And you can

[01:16 - 01:19]
sign in with your email or you could

[01:17 - 01:21]
sign up uh just by connecting you know

[01:19 - 01:22]
your Microsoft account, Apple account

[01:21 - 01:24]
Google account, whatever works for you.

[01:22 - 01:26]
Now I already have an account so I'm

[01:24 - 01:28]
going to switch over to that in another

[01:26 - 01:29]
tab here. All right. So once you sign in

[01:28 - 01:30]
it's going to look something like this.

[01:29 - 01:33]
We have a box in the middle. It says ask

[01:30 - 01:35]
anything. And so the first example, the

[01:33 - 01:37]
first prompt would be a very simple fact

[01:35 - 01:38]
retrieval. So maybe I could say what do

[01:37 - 01:40]
sloths eat? And it'll just give me an

[01:38 - 01:42]
answer of you know what sloths eat?

[01:40 - 01:43]
They're herbivores and stuff like that.

[01:42 - 01:44]
And it's going to show you the answers

[01:43 - 01:46]
in the middle here. And now I can ask

[01:44 - 01:48]
follow-up questions on that. But if I

[01:46 - 01:50]
want to change the topic, maybe I want

[01:48 - 01:51]
to ask about plants, but I don't really

[01:50 - 01:53]
want to talk about sloths anymore, I can

[01:51 - 01:55]
have a new conversation. All the

[01:53 - 01:57]
conversations are listed on the left

[01:55 - 01:58]
side here. So as you, you know, use this

[01:57 - 02:00]
more and more, you'll have a very long

[01:58 - 02:02]
list. And if you want to make a new one

[02:00 - 02:04]
on the top, you can click on this little

[02:02 - 02:05]
new chat icon. That'll bring you into

[02:04 - 02:07]
that same interface where we can start a

[02:05 - 02:10]
new chat. Again, a few things to note

[02:07 - 02:11]
about chat GBT. It is online, so it's up

[02:10 - 02:13]
to date with relevant information. You

[02:11 - 02:14]
can ask it about current events and

[02:13 - 02:16]
things like that. Second thing, it used

[02:14 - 02:18]
to be bad at things like math. It's

[02:16 - 02:19]
getting significantly better at

[02:18 - 02:21]
mathematics. So, if you want to ask

[02:19 - 02:23]
questions about math, you totally can.

[02:21 - 02:24]
But I recommend, you know

[02:23 - 02:26]
double-checking it. If you're asking

[02:24 - 02:28]
like wave equations for quantum, for

[02:26 - 02:30]
example, it can, you know, more advanced

[02:28 - 02:31]
math, it's more likely to have some

[02:30 - 02:34]
errors. Another thing, so let's go back

[02:31 - 02:35]
to that that first example I had. If you

[02:34 - 02:37]
don't like the responses, we have a

[02:35 - 02:39]
couple things on the bottom. So, for

[02:37 - 02:41]
one, we can copy this. If we like this

[02:39 - 02:43]
and we want to paste it in, you know, a

[02:41 - 02:44]
word document, for example, we can give

[02:43 - 02:45]
some feedback to the model and say

[02:44 - 02:47]
"Hey, that was a good response or that

[02:45 - 02:49]
was a bad response." We can have it read

[02:47 - 02:52]
that aloud to us, uh, we can edit in

[02:49 - 02:53]
canvas. I'll talk about canvas later. Or

[02:52 - 02:55]
if you're like, you know what, actually

[02:53 - 02:57]
I didn't specify what I wanted. You can

[02:55 - 02:59]
go up here, click on the edit message

[02:57 - 03:01]
and we could say, "What do two toad

[02:59 - 03:02]
sloths What do two toad sloths eat?"

[03:01 - 03:04]
Maybe we want to be more specific here

[03:02 - 03:06]
and we can say, "Send." It's going to

[03:04 - 03:07]
create a new response. But again, if we

[03:06 - 03:09]
don't like this response, I can click on

[03:07 - 03:11]
the little switch model button and just

[03:09 - 03:13]
say try again. It'll try again with the

[03:11 - 03:14]
same model here and give us a slightly

[03:13 - 03:16]
different response. And we can toggle

[03:14 - 03:17]
between the responses with the one out

[03:16 - 03:19]
of two or two out of two with the left

[03:17 - 03:21]
and right arrow. So this is particularly

[03:19 - 03:23]
useful later on in the video when we're

[03:21 - 03:24]
making images. But even for now, a

[03:23 - 03:25]
useful feature to know about. And

[03:24 - 03:28]
another thing to note is that if you

[03:25 - 03:29]
ever want to search the web, the way you

[03:28 - 03:30]
use Google, you can click on search

[03:29 - 03:33]
right there. It's going to search the

[03:30 - 03:35]
web. And I could say a sloth blog. I

[03:33 - 03:37]
could just say a sloth blog. It'll find

[03:35 - 03:38]
something on the web and it'll link it

[03:37 - 03:39]
out for me right here. So, it'll give me

[03:38 - 03:41]
some summaries of different things as

[03:39 - 03:42]
well as links. You can see these little

[03:41 - 03:44]
links right here. So, Wikipedia

[03:42 - 03:46]
people.com, the sloth institute. And so

[03:44 - 03:48]
I can click on them maybe like the sloth

[03:46 - 03:49]
institute. We can click on that and

[03:48 - 03:51]
it'll bring us over to the

[03:49 - 03:53]
slothinstitute.org. So, a good way to

[03:51 - 03:54]
get links if you're trying to find

[03:53 - 03:55]
things. So, if you're trying to find

[03:54 - 03:57]
websites, that little search button is

[03:55 - 03:58]
going to be very useful. So, prompt

[03:57 - 04:00]
number one, which is simple fact

[03:58 - 04:01]
retrieval. Getting a little bit more

[04:00 - 04:03]
advanced though to something that you

[04:01 - 04:04]
can't ask on Google search necessarily.

[04:03 - 04:05]
Let's say you're trying to think of

[04:04 - 04:07]
something. It's on the tip of your

[04:05 - 04:09]
tongue. You can't remember a word and

[04:07 - 04:10]
you just say like, "I'm blanking on of a

[04:09 - 04:12]
word that like it's kind of like this

[04:10 - 04:14]
thing. Sometimes they use it to describe

[04:12 - 04:15]
a bird. What What is the word I'm

[04:14 - 04:17]
thinking of?" And it's able to take the

[04:15 - 04:19]
context of that and even though you

[04:17 - 04:20]
don't have key words, this is really

[04:19 - 04:22]
understanding what you're talking about.

[04:20 - 04:24]
So, you can see the responses right

[04:22 - 04:25]
here. It has a couple ideas and like

[04:24 - 04:26]
"Oh, there it is. I was thinking of

[04:25 - 04:27]
cardinal. I don't know why I couldn't

[04:26 - 04:29]
think of that word." And there we go.

[04:27 - 04:31]
Moving along to something slightly more

[04:29 - 04:32]
complex. We can actually modify how it's

[04:31 - 04:34]
going to be giving us the responses. So

[04:32 - 04:36]
you could ask it things like, you know

[04:34 - 04:38]
explain electricity to me like I'm five.

[04:36 - 04:40]
Or even better than that, you could have

[04:38 - 04:42]
it make analogies and comparison. So I

[04:40 - 04:43]
could say, please explain electricity

[04:42 - 04:44]
and circuits to me, you know, related to

[04:43 - 04:47]
kayaking. Maybe I'm really into

[04:44 - 04:48]
kayaking. I can hit enter. And this is

[04:47 - 04:50]
going to really kind of give you some

[04:48 - 04:52]
type of analogy that makes sense there.

[04:50 - 04:53]
So the river is like the circuit. Uh

[04:52 - 04:55]
voltage is like the slope of the river

[04:53 - 04:57]
like how fast your flow is is going to

[04:55 - 04:58]
be current. Uh different things like

[04:57 - 04:59]
that. This could be really useful in

[04:58 - 05:01]
explaining things in a way that really

[04:59 - 05:03]
makes sense to you specifically. And

[05:01 - 05:04]
with chatbt, you can actually ask it

[05:03 - 05:06]
follow-up questions as I mentioned

[05:04 - 05:07]
before because it does remember the

[05:06 - 05:09]
context of your previous question. So I

[05:07 - 05:10]
could say, "Okay, but why is the

[05:09 - 05:11]
steepness of the river causing it to be

[05:10 - 05:13]
more powerful?" And then again, that

[05:11 - 05:15]
modifier, please explain it to me like

[05:13 - 05:16]
I'm five. And one more note on the

[05:15 - 05:18]
modifiers here. It doesn't have to just

[05:16 - 05:20]
be, you know, using analogies or talk to

[05:18 - 05:22]
me like I'm this. You could ask it to be

[05:20 - 05:23]
a certain person. You could say, you

[05:22 - 05:24]
know, speak in the voice of like, let's

[05:23 - 05:27]
say we're going to write a comment about

[05:24 - 05:29]
Mike's chat GBT tutorial in the voice of

[05:27 - 05:30]
and like you could try this yourself if

[05:29 - 05:32]
you're following along. ask it for like

[05:30 - 05:34]
your favorite celebrity, uh, musician

[05:32 - 05:36]
artist, whatever. So, I'm going to say

[05:34 - 05:37]
Abe Lincoln. All right, that's pretty

[05:36 - 05:39]
funny. So, I mean, if you guys did this

[05:37 - 05:40]
feel free to like drop a comment down

[05:39 - 05:41]
below. I want to see what these actually

[05:40 - 05:43]
look like and let me know which voice

[05:41 - 05:44]
used as the modifier for this one. So

[05:43 - 05:46]
like I said, you can have it like Dave

[05:44 - 05:47]
Chappelle or anyone you want. All right

[05:46 - 05:48]
so I'm going to start a new chat and I

[05:47 - 05:50]
want to show you another feature right

[05:48 - 05:51]
here. So, number four is going to be

[05:50 - 05:53]
making a list and you can make lists

[05:51 - 05:54]
for example, of maybe you're trying to

[05:53 - 05:56]
come up with a business name, 30

[05:54 - 05:58]
fictitious business names that are

[05:56 - 05:59]
between four and 10 letters long, easily

[05:58 - 06:01]
pronouncable. I spelled pronouncable

[05:59 - 06:02]
wrong. Pronouncable, but it's okay. You

[06:01 - 06:04]
can spell things wrong and chat GBT

[06:02 - 06:06]
still usually knows what you mean. Uh

[06:04 - 06:08]
you can also say available.com domain.

[06:06 - 06:09]
But before we do this, another little

[06:08 - 06:11]
cool trick that you have is called

[06:09 - 06:13]
temporary. Now, it doesn't really make

[06:11 - 06:14]
sense in this example, but sometimes

[06:13 - 06:16]
you're researching things that you don't

[06:14 - 06:18]
want that context to influence future

[06:16 - 06:20]
chats you have with chat GBT. And so

[06:18 - 06:21]
it's going to not remember this. It's

[06:20 - 06:24]
going to essentially be like an

[06:21 - 06:25]
incognito mode for your chat GBT. So, I

[06:24 - 06:27]
can hit enter here. It's going to come

[06:25 - 06:29]
up with 30 fictitious names that should

[06:27 - 06:31]
be pronouncable. Let's see what it does.

[06:29 - 06:33]
So, yeah, it's got quite a few that I've

[06:31 - 06:34]
never heard of. I think Treasure is a

[06:33 - 06:35]
real one. Some of these might be real.

[06:34 - 06:36]
You want to double check them

[06:35 - 06:38]
obviously, but this is a good way to

[06:36 - 06:39]
brainstorm. Uh, you know, coming up with

[06:38 - 06:40]
a really long list. For example, and you

[06:39 - 06:43]
can do this with so many different

[06:40 - 06:44]
things. It can make lists of 30 for just

[06:43 - 06:47]
about anything you want. 30 crock-pot

[06:44 - 06:49]
meals, 30 different exercises that use

[06:47 - 06:50]
biceps, 30 different list prompts you

[06:49 - 06:52]
could ask chat GPT. All right, so let's

[06:50 - 06:53]
open up a new chat. We're on to number

[06:52 - 06:54]
five now. So, this is going to be

[06:53 - 06:56]
modifying text that you've actually

[06:54 - 06:58]
written. So, let's go with the intro of

[06:56 - 06:59]
this video. So, I'm going to say I'm

[06:58 - 07:00]
just going to paste the intro right

[06:59 - 07:03]
there. And now below that, I'm going to

[07:00 - 07:05]
say, "Please rewrite this." And I could

[07:03 - 07:06]
have it translate to another language. I

[07:05 - 07:08]
could have it rewrite it more condensed.

[07:06 - 07:09]
I could have just say, "Rewrite this and

[07:08 - 07:11]
don't plagiarize." And it's a good way

[07:09 - 07:12]
to kind of rewrite some things. If you

[07:11 - 07:13]
have, you know, if you have some

[07:12 - 07:15]
writer's block, you're writing a long

[07:13 - 07:16]
email you're writing, you know, anything

[07:15 - 07:17]
you're writing, you just say, "Hey, redo

[07:16 - 07:19]
this." And just kind of get a different

[07:17 - 07:21]
idea of other ways to say this. You can

[07:19 - 07:22]
also say, "Hey, why don't you uh add a

[07:21 - 07:24]
quote or do something like that to

[07:22 - 07:25]
this?" Number six is going to be using

[07:24 - 07:27]
step-by-step instructions with

[07:25 - 07:28]
interactive memory. So, for this, I

[07:27 - 07:29]
actually find it most useful to use the

[07:28 - 07:31]
voice mode. So, if I click on voice

[07:29 - 07:34]
mode, by the way, you can do this on the

[07:31 - 07:35]
mobile app or on your laptop. So, for

[07:34 - 07:38]
voice mode, I'm just going to say, "Hey

[07:35 - 07:42]
uh, how's it going, Chat GBT? I have uh

[07:38 - 07:44]
carrots and celery and potatoes and some

[07:42 - 07:47]
chicken breasts and some uh some beef

[07:44 - 07:48]
some ground beef and uh some chicken

[07:47 - 07:50]
stock and a couple other like basic

[07:48 - 07:52]
ingredients in my in my pantry

[07:50 - 07:53]
including some noodles and some rice. Uh

[07:52 - 07:55]
what's a good thing I can make for

[07:53 - 07:57]
dinner? Hey Mike, sounds like you've got

[07:55 - 07:59]
a great mix of ingredients. How about a

[07:57 - 08:01]
hearty chicken and vegetable soup? You

[07:59 - 08:04]
can use the chicken breasts, carrots

[08:01 - 08:05]
celery, potatoes, and chicken stock. Add

[08:04 - 08:08]
some noodles or rice to make it

[08:05 - 08:10]
heartier. Season it with salt, pepper

[08:08 - 08:13]
and maybe some herbs like thyme or bay

[08:10 - 08:15]
leaves. So, I can also I want to uh

[08:13 - 08:17]
maybe add onions. Like I think I have an

[08:15 - 08:19]
onion somewhere. Would onions go well in

[08:17 - 08:21]
that or no? Definitely. Onions would be

[08:19 - 08:23]
a great addition. They add a nice depth

[08:21 - 08:25]
of flavor to the soup. Just dice them up

[08:23 - 08:26]
and saut√© them with the carrots and

[08:25 - 08:29]
celery before adding the chicken and

[08:26 - 08:31]
stock. It'll give the soup a nice savory

[08:29 - 08:33]
base. Okay. And I want to make this a

[08:31 - 08:35]
crock-ot meal. Can you just give me a

[08:33 - 08:37]
full recipe of this exact meal for a

[08:35 - 08:39]
crock-pot? Sure. Here's a simple

[08:37 - 08:41]
crock-ot chicken and vegetable soup

[08:39 - 08:42]
recipe. One, dice two chicken breast.

[08:41 - 08:44]
So, when you're done, just click on the

[08:42 - 08:46]
X and you'll see the entire conversation

[08:44 - 08:47]
we had is going to be right here. And

[08:46 - 08:50]
you can also continue on this. So, you

[08:47 - 08:51]
could say, please add more detail and

[08:50 - 08:53]
it'll just, you know, continue with what

[08:51 - 08:55]
you did and write a longer recipe. So

[08:53 - 08:56]
you can actually have like, you know

[08:55 - 08:58]
how many servings, how many calories

[08:56 - 08:59]
different things like that all on that.

[08:58 - 09:01]
So, that's a cool feature that does

[08:59 - 09:03]
exist on ChateBT. Now, now before we get

[09:01 - 09:05]
into the really cool ones, which I would

[09:03 - 09:06]
say is the second half of this video

[09:05 - 09:08]
one more that I want to mention is going

[09:06 - 09:10]
to be a multiconstraint prompt. So, you

[09:08 - 09:11]
can ask it to really do a lot of things

[09:10 - 09:12]
within a certain box, and that's

[09:11 - 09:14]
something you really can't do on a

[09:12 - 09:16]
traditional search. So, you could say uh

[09:14 - 09:20]
compare the new Tesla Model 3 and the

[09:16 - 09:22]
Toyota RAV 4 plug-in hybrid in a uh song

[09:20 - 09:24]
written by a style of Bob Dylan. Add a

[09:22 - 09:26]
relevant quote from Obama and another

[09:24 - 09:28]
one from from Larry Bird. Like, a really

[09:26 - 09:30]
tight constraint that you're never going

[09:28 - 09:31]
to find a blog that does that. But if

[09:30 - 09:33]
for some reason that's what you're

[09:31 - 09:35]
looking for, this is exactly what it's

[09:33 - 09:36]
able to do. Now, it doesn't have to be a

[09:35 - 09:38]
song. It could just be, you know, write

[09:36 - 09:39]
a little description and use analogies

[09:38 - 09:41]
and do stuff like that. But adding those

[09:39 - 09:44]
multiple constraints, uh, really does

[09:41 - 09:46]
allow you to modify exactly what you're

[09:44 - 09:47]
getting back from this. Uh, yeah, I'd

[09:46 - 09:48]
say that's actually quite impressive.

[09:47 - 09:50]
That's definitely what I was looking

[09:48 - 09:52]
for. New chat and getting into some

[09:50 - 09:53]
really interesting and really impressive

[09:52 - 09:56]
ones. Number eight is going to be image

[09:53 - 09:57]
generation. So, we can ask Chat GBT to

[09:56 - 09:59]
make an image. And I recommend being as

[09:57 - 10:01]
specific as possible for this. You can

[09:59 - 10:03]
make images in different styles. Photo

[10:01 - 10:05]
realistic, maybe like a watercolor

[10:03 - 10:06]
style, maybe a crayon style, something

[10:05 - 10:08]
like that. So, I'm going to say make an

[10:06 - 10:10]
a marketing image. So, maybe I want to

[10:08 - 10:11]
use this to sell a product uh on the

[10:10 - 10:12]
internet. And it's going to be a

[10:11 - 10:13]
supplement bottle. And I could have some

[10:12 - 10:15]
really exact things like come up with a

[10:13 - 10:17]
good name for this, what it's going to

[10:15 - 10:18]
be, uh you know, what else is going to

[10:17 - 10:20]
be in the image. And let's see what it

[10:18 - 10:22]
comes up with. I mean, look at that.

[10:20 - 10:23]
Like I that that's just that's

[10:22 - 10:25]
absolutely incredible that it's able to

[10:23 - 10:27]
do that. Uh but it's not done yet. You

[10:25 - 10:28]
can actually modify this even further.

[10:27 - 10:30]
So, this is going to work as if you had

[10:28 - 10:32]
a graphic designer, which by the way

[10:30 - 10:34]
this right here would have taken you a

[10:32 - 10:35]
graphic designer, a photographer to get

[10:34 - 10:37]
all that going. And also, like, you

[10:35 - 10:39]
know, the ideation of coming up with uh

[10:37 - 10:40]
the name of it and everything like this

[10:39 - 10:42]
is really impressive that it just did

[10:40 - 10:43]
that based on a single prompt. But like

[10:42 - 10:44]
I said, you can interact with this, but

[10:43 - 10:45]
you can actually say, hey, let's let's

[10:44 - 10:47]
make that let's change that background

[10:45 - 10:49]
to a light orange. Maybe instead of

[10:47 - 10:51]
instead of that whitish color, maybe I

[10:49 - 10:52]
want it to be a slightly light orange.

[10:51 - 10:54]
You could also have it uh instead make

[10:52 - 10:55]
it, you know, transparent. You can

[10:54 - 10:57]
download this as a PNG with a

[10:55 - 10:58]
transparent background. Now, one thing

[10:57 - 11:01]
to note, you're probably not going to

[10:58 - 11:03]
see this often, but sometimes chat tpt

[11:01 - 11:05]
gives you two responses just for its own

[11:03 - 11:06]
feedback and then you can select which

[11:05 - 11:08]
one's better. All right, so we have two

[11:06 - 11:10]
very slight differences in the image

[11:08 - 11:11]
really just this is a little darker and

[11:10 - 11:13]
this is a little bit lighter. Uh so we

[11:11 - 11:14]
can choose which one we like. Maybe I

[11:13 - 11:15]
could say I like this response better

[11:14 - 11:17]
and I could say I prefer this response.

[11:15 - 11:19]
Now we have that in there. One thing to

[11:17 - 11:20]
note, if you're ever going back and you

[11:19 - 11:22]
want to edit like the the prompt up

[11:20 - 11:24]
here, uh it's going to delete everything

[11:22 - 11:26]
after that. So, I recommend not doing it

[11:24 - 11:28]
in that sense. Like, you don't want to

[11:26 - 11:29]
go back and change this prompt up here

[11:28 - 11:31]
unless you're okay with losing this one.

[11:29 - 11:32]
And when you like these images, we can

[11:31 - 11:34]
just click on download. So, click on

[11:32 - 11:35]
download right there. And I could

[11:34 - 11:37]
download it, uh, you know, and just use

[11:35 - 11:39]
this anywhere I need to. Uh, being that

[11:37 - 11:41]
we have this image right now, we can

[11:39 - 11:43]
also upload images and ask it to modify

[11:41 - 11:44]
those. I'll talk about that a little bit

[11:43 - 11:46]
later in one of the upcoming prompts.

[11:44 - 11:47]
Kind of shifting gears a little bit, you

[11:46 - 11:49]
can actually use this pretty heavily for

[11:47 - 11:51]
any kind of coding. So even if you know

[11:49 - 11:53]
nothing about coding, you can ask it to

[11:51 - 11:55]
help you start coding an app or maybe

[11:53 - 11:57]
something in command line or start off a

[11:55 - 11:58]
lot simpler and just set up some

[11:57 - 12:00]
essential code. So I can just say I need

[11:58 - 12:02]
this right here. It's going to give me

[12:00 - 12:03]
essentially uh the formula we can use in

[12:02 - 12:05]
Excel and it shows up in this little

[12:03 - 12:07]
prompt box right here. So uh that really

[12:05 - 12:09]
makes it a lot easier. I can just copy

[12:07 - 12:11]
this or just click on copy and then

[12:09 - 12:13]
paste that into my, you know, Google

[12:11 - 12:14]
Sheets or my Excel spreadsheet and it

[12:13 - 12:16]
should work just fine. If it doesn't

[12:14 - 12:17]
which by the way, it's nice that it

[12:16 - 12:18]
explains what everything is. If it

[12:17 - 12:20]
doesn't, you can always troubleshoot it

[12:18 - 12:21]
right here and say, "Hey, this

[12:20 - 12:23]
happened." Also, by the way, it also

[12:21 - 12:25]
gives you uh another version down here.

[12:23 - 12:26]
So, we have two options there. You can

[12:25 - 12:28]
say, "Hey, it didn't work right. This is

[12:26 - 12:29]
the error gave me or something like

[12:28 - 12:32]
that." And it's able to debug and

[12:29 - 12:33]
troubleshoot directly in here. Prompt

[12:32 - 12:35]
number 10 is actually a multi-prompt

[12:33 - 12:37]
chain with dynamic interaction where you

[12:35 - 12:38]
tell chat GBT to be a specific thing.

[12:37 - 12:40]
So, I can say, "You're my personal

[12:38 - 12:42]
fitness coach. Ask me a bunch of

[12:40 - 12:43]
questions. This is my goal." And then

[12:42 - 12:45]
make a plan for me. And this is going to

[12:43 - 12:47]
give you an interactive conversation

[12:45 - 12:49]
with chat GPT uh where it's going to

[12:47 - 12:50]
say, okay, like you know, how much do

[12:49 - 12:52]
you weigh right now? What are you trying

[12:50 - 12:53]
to do? What is your training history?

[12:52 - 12:55]
Different things like that. So, we can

[12:53 - 12:56]
answer these questions. All right, so I

[12:55 - 12:58]
answered the questions. It's going to

[12:56 - 13:00]
kind of build out a plan for me now. And

[12:58 - 13:02]
whenever I'm done, I can ask it to

[13:00 - 13:04]
export this as a PDF. All right, there

[13:02 - 13:06]
we go. We have a PDF. I can click on it.

[13:04 - 13:07]
It'll download it. I can save it right

[13:06 - 13:09]
here. And then I can actually check that

[13:07 - 13:11]
out. Let's let's view a little sample of

[13:09 - 13:12]
that. There's the full PDF. They got rid

[13:11 - 13:14]
of the emojis, which I think is really

[13:12 - 13:15]
nice. and clean. And I can print this

[13:14 - 13:18]
out. I have it. I'm ready to go to the

[13:15 - 13:19]
gym. And I have my full plan right here.

[13:18 - 13:21]
Now, that brings me into number 11

[13:19 - 13:23]
which kind of ties in with that a little

[13:21 - 13:25]
bit. Let's say I want to make a a lease

[13:23 - 13:26]
as a landlord. Uh there's this cool

[13:25 - 13:28]
feature called Canvas. If I click on

[13:26 - 13:30]
view tools, I can go to canvas, and now

[13:28 - 13:31]
I can add this full prompt. I'm going to

[13:30 - 13:34]
say I'm going to make a legal contract.

[13:31 - 13:36]
I'm charging somebody uh to live in the

[13:34 - 13:38]
other half of a house that I potentially

[13:36 - 13:39]
own here. Uh and I could say, you know

[13:38 - 13:41]
enter. And it's going to open a canvas.

[13:39 - 13:43]
It's kind of a different format. You'll

[13:41 - 13:45]
see in just a second it makes the full

[13:43 - 13:46]
lease. So there you go. It opened it up

[13:45 - 13:48]
automatically. Uh you can see the lease

[13:46 - 13:49]
on the left side. All the prompts are

[13:48 - 13:51]
going to show up here. But the cool

[13:49 - 13:52]
thing about Canvas is that it is

[13:51 - 13:54]
interactive. So the reason I choose

[13:52 - 13:56]
canvas for something like a lease like

[13:54 - 13:58]
this is that I'm able to actually type

[13:56 - 13:59]
into this once it's done. So it's going

[13:58 - 14:01]
to generate the whole thing. There we

[13:59 - 14:03]
go. So we have it. I can actually go to

[14:01 - 14:05]
the top and enter the date. So I could

[14:03 - 14:07]
say 12th day even though today's is not.

[14:05 - 14:08]
It's the 17th. So you're able to edit

[14:07 - 14:10]
like like I said right there. You can

[14:08 - 14:12]
also use chat GBT to edit things even

[14:10 - 14:14]
further. Uh, so I can highlight this and

[14:12 - 14:16]
I can ask ChatGBT and it rewrites it.

[14:14 - 14:17]
There we go. Security deposit required

[14:16 - 14:19]
of $500. So, you're able to kind of work

[14:17 - 14:21]
with this and this is really useful not

[14:19 - 14:23]
only in creating contracts and things

[14:21 - 14:24]
like that. Obviously, consult a legal

[14:23 - 14:26]
adviser before you use this stuff, but

[14:24 - 14:27]
uh, you know, just for at least starting

[14:26 - 14:29]
somewhere, it's pretty useful, but it's

[14:27 - 14:31]
also useful for writing code, for

[14:29 - 14:32]
example, where you can write everything

[14:31 - 14:34]
kind of debug within here and ask

[14:32 - 14:35]
questions and ask it to add things. So

[14:34 - 14:37]
instead of saying rewrite the whole

[14:35 - 14:38]
thing but change that sentence, it's

[14:37 - 14:40]
just a lot easier to highlight what you

[14:38 - 14:42]
want changed uh and change it in here.

[14:40 - 14:44]
And when you're done, again, you can

[14:42 - 14:45]
either export, you can say generate a

[14:44 - 14:47]
PDF, write that over on the left side

[14:45 - 14:49]
generate a PDF. It'll generate a PDF of

[14:47 - 14:51]
this entire thing, and then we're ready

[14:49 - 14:52]
to roll uh with that new thing without

[14:51 - 14:54]
having all those weird blanks. We can

[14:52 - 14:56]
fill it in and have it ready to go. All

[14:54 - 14:58]
right, so let's close out of this. Open

[14:56 - 15:00]
our little panel again. Let's make a new

[14:58 - 15:02]
uh conversation. And now number 12. This

[15:00 - 15:04]
is really cool. you're able to interpret

[15:02 - 15:06]
images that you send to chatbt. So I can

[15:04 - 15:07]
paste an image right here that I just

[15:06 - 15:08]
found on Google. We're going to call it

[15:07 - 15:10]
my living room. And I'm going to say

[15:08 - 15:12]
please redesign or please create an

[15:10 - 15:14]
image that is redesign a redesign of my

[15:12 - 15:15]
living room in an art deco style. And

[15:14 - 15:16]
you can see it's creating an image.

[15:15 - 15:18]
Let's see what it does. So it's

[15:16 - 15:19]
important to note this is the first time

[15:18 - 15:22]
we've added something that's not just

[15:19 - 15:23]
text or my voice. Uh there's other ways

[15:22 - 15:25]
you can add files. You can upload

[15:23 - 15:27]
documents, you can upload PDFs, you can

[15:25 - 15:29]
upload spreadsheets, you can upload

[15:27 - 15:30]
images, or you can copy and paste images

[15:29 - 15:32]
into here. All right. All right. So, you

[15:30 - 15:34]
can see we have the same furniture in

[15:32 - 15:35]
there. We've got a lot of similarities.

[15:34 - 15:37]
They just changed like the wallpaper and

[15:35 - 15:38]
the curtains. A little bit dramatic, but

[15:37 - 15:39]
kind of an interesting way to get

[15:38 - 15:41]
different ideas for like interior

[15:39 - 15:43]
design. But the real point is that it's

[15:41 - 15:44]
able to interpret an image, make a new

[15:43 - 15:46]
image based on that. And an important

[15:44 - 15:48]
note here is that so far in this video

[15:46 - 15:50]
we've only had text inputs and a couple

[15:48 - 15:52]
voice inputs, but uh we haven't had any

[15:50 - 15:53]
image input. So, I copied and pasted

[15:52 - 15:55]
that image there. Moving on to number

[15:53 - 15:57]
13. There are other files you can add to

[15:55 - 15:58]
this. So you can have Google Drive, you

[15:57 - 16:00]
can connect to One Drive, or you can

[15:58 - 16:01]
upload a document from your computer. It

[16:00 - 16:03]
could be a PDF, it could be a

[16:01 - 16:04]
spreadsheet, it could be all kinds of

[16:03 - 16:07]
different things. So let's say I found

[16:04 - 16:09]
this really long uh report. It's a it's

[16:07 - 16:12]
a about Timberland investment. So I'm

[16:09 - 16:13]
going to say, hey, here's here's a PDF.

[16:12 - 16:15]
Can you summarize it for me? It'll read

[16:13 - 16:16]
the entire thing. It'll give you a

[16:15 - 16:18]
summary very very quickly as well. And

[16:16 - 16:21]
then I can ask further questions about

[16:18 - 16:23]
this. So I could say like, was there any

[16:21 - 16:24]
mention of yield curve for southern pine

[16:23 - 16:25]
crop? And I want to ask a follow-up

[16:24 - 16:26]
question, even though we already know

[16:25 - 16:27]
how to do this, but I want to show you

[16:26 - 16:28]
something else in this follow-up

[16:27 - 16:31]
question. Just a generic question, the

[16:28 - 16:32]
the value of a southern pine per board

[16:31 - 16:34]
foot. So, it's giving me an answer right

[16:32 - 16:35]
here, but there's actually a different

[16:34 - 16:37]
way we can do this. So, I haven't really

[16:35 - 16:39]
talked about this yet in this video.

[16:37 - 16:40]
There are different chat GBT models.

[16:39 - 16:42]
These are very confusing because there

[16:40 - 16:44]
are so many of them. And there is very

[16:42 - 16:46]
likely going to be chat GBT5 coming out

[16:44 - 16:49]
that just consolidates all of them. But

[16:46 - 16:50]
at least for now, chat GBT40 is almost

[16:49 - 16:53]
definitely going to be the one you're

[16:50 - 16:55]
using most of the time. But 03 does have

[16:53 - 16:57]
more advanced reasoning. Uh which might

[16:55 - 16:58]
be what I want to do right here. So if

[16:57 - 16:59]
you ever don't like a response, you're

[16:58 - 17:02]
like, I wish it just went a little

[16:59 - 17:03]
deeper or had more reasoning or or was a

[17:02 - 17:05]
little faster. For example, you can

[17:03 - 17:07]
click on switch model. And for this one

[17:05 - 17:08]
let's say we want to rerun this, but we

[17:07 - 17:11]
want to do it with more advanced

[17:08 - 17:12]
reasoning, which is which is chat GBT3.

[17:11 - 17:14]
Now, this is going to take longer, but

[17:12 - 17:16]
you'll see it does give us much more

[17:14 - 17:18]
thinking and much more uh of an

[17:16 - 17:19]
analytical answer here. And you'll see

[17:18 - 17:21]
it kind of shows what it's doing, what

[17:19 - 17:23]
it's thinking about. So, it says, "Hey

[17:21 - 17:25]
like you live in Pennsylvania. We're

[17:23 - 17:26]
going to find more localized uh, you

[17:25 - 17:28]
know, values. We're going to look at

[17:26 - 17:29]
what we're referencing. Here's the

[17:28 - 17:30]
websites we're looking at." You can

[17:29 - 17:32]
click on these, by the way, and just

[17:30 - 17:34]
learn more about what it's doing. So

[17:32 - 17:36]
there we go. Now, it tells me what the

[17:34 - 17:40]
math is. So, it's saying uh 19 cents per

[17:36 - 17:41]
board foot, $25 per ton, or $188 per

[17:40 - 17:42]
thousand board feet. So, it's pretty

[17:41 - 17:43]
interesting that you have these

[17:42 - 17:44]
different models, and you're going to

[17:43 - 17:46]
get very different styles of answers

[17:44 - 17:48]
which with each of them. Number 14. I

[17:46 - 17:49]
actually don't have an audio file to do

[17:48 - 17:51]
this, but we could upload an audio file.

[17:49 - 17:52]
This could be like a 2-hour long podcast

[17:51 - 17:54]
and we could say like, "Hey, here's a

[17:52 - 17:57]
2-hour podcast file. Can you transcribe

[17:54 - 17:59]
it and summarize the key elements for

[17:57 - 18:01]
me?" Number 15. This unlocks an entire

[17:59 - 18:03]
can of worms here. If we go over to

[18:01 - 18:05]
Sora, we click on Sora on the top left

[18:03 - 18:07]
we can actually not only create images

[18:05 - 18:08]
but also create videos here. So, we can

[18:07 - 18:11]
choose if we're making an image is going

[18:08 - 18:13]
to be a video. We can choose whatever

[18:11 - 18:14]
the aspect ratio is, the resolution of

[18:13 - 18:16]
it. So, let's just go with a low

[18:14 - 18:18]
resolution for now. The length of the

[18:16 - 18:20]
video, so maybe a five or 10 second

[18:18 - 18:21]
video. We could have one or two or four

[18:20 - 18:23]
variations of this. And we could choose

[18:21 - 18:24]
if we want to have any kind of presets.

[18:23 - 18:26]
And then we can hit enter. And this is

[18:24 - 18:28]
actually disabling it because it says it

[18:26 - 18:29]
is a new account with Sora. So I'd have

[18:28 - 18:30]
to use my other account to get this. But

[18:29 - 18:32]
let's go with image creation at least

[18:30 - 18:34]
for now. Uh see how this works. You can

[18:32 - 18:35]
see some of the sample videos that it's

[18:34 - 18:37]
been making. Like these look incredibly

[18:35 - 18:39]
real. This is those are not real people.

[18:37 - 18:41]
That is entirely made by AI. Uh you can

[18:39 - 18:43]
see all the ones they've made. There are

[18:41 - 18:44]
these are very impressive that what AI

[18:43 - 18:46]
is actually able to do now. So that's

[18:44 - 18:47]
Sor. That's really a topic for another

[18:46 - 18:50]
video though. Then finally getting into

[18:47 - 18:52]
number 16. This is the most advanced one

[18:50 - 18:54]
in my opinion. Uh if you're trying to do

[18:52 - 18:55]
a ton of research, dive really, really

[18:54 - 18:57]
deep into something. There's something

[18:55 - 18:59]
called deep research down on the bottom.

[18:57 - 19:00]
Uh I actually did this earlier. It takes

[18:59 - 19:02]
a really long time. Takes like, you

[19:00 - 19:04]
know, 15 minutes or more. Uh and it can

[19:02 - 19:05]
tell you a lot about any kind of topic.

[19:04 - 19:07]
So if you're trying to learn about

[19:05 - 19:09]
something, uh let let me search up here.

[19:07 - 19:11]
By the way, we have search chats. I did

[19:09 - 19:15]
this earlier about sloths. So uh let's

[19:11 - 19:17]
say sloths. Uh I think I said this. Let

[19:15 - 19:18]
me scroll to the top. So, in order to do

[19:17 - 19:20]
this, when you're typing out a prompt

[19:18 - 19:21]
you just click on deep research right

[19:20 - 19:22]
there. And then you ask the prompt, and

[19:21 - 19:24]
it's going to give you this whole thing.

[19:22 - 19:26]
So, I said, "Tell me everything I need

[19:24 - 19:27]
to know about a sloth." And it says

[19:26 - 19:29]
"Uh, what do you want?" I said, "Just

[19:27 - 19:31]
everything." And this is what it came up

[19:29 - 19:32]
with. You got images in here. We've got

[19:31 - 19:33]
uh, references to like National

[19:32 - 19:35]
geographic. You can click on these

[19:33 - 19:37]
sources and learn more about where I was

[19:35 - 19:39]
actually getting this stuff. Let me

[19:37 - 19:40]
close out of that. Um, you can go down

[19:39 - 19:42]
here and it tells you, you know, this

[19:40 - 19:43]
goes on and on. So, we've got just all

[19:42 - 19:46]
these links in here. It's citing its

[19:43 - 19:48]
sources. Again, not a lot of it is a lot

[19:46 - 19:49]
of Nat Geo on here, but also, you know

[19:48 - 19:51]
some other

[19:49 - 19:54]
wf.org. And this is I mean, this is

[19:51 - 19:56]
basically like a small book on on what

[19:54 - 19:57]
you need to know about sloths. So, this

[19:56 - 19:58]
could be very useful if you're trying to

[19:57 - 20:00]
start a business and you want to know

[19:58 - 20:03]
all the details about uh you know

[20:00 - 20:04]
growing plants in a greenhouse or

[20:03 - 20:05]
anything like that. Yeah, look at that.

[20:04 - 20:07]
And then at the bottom, we've got our

[20:05 - 20:08]
sources down here. This is the kind of

[20:07 - 20:10]
thing I would definitely export as a

[20:08 - 20:12]
PDF. One final note before I send you

[20:10 - 20:14]
off here, we have a little three bonuses

[20:12 - 20:16]
on the top right. If you click on your

[20:14 - 20:18]
icon, uh your your logo right there, you

[20:16 - 20:20]
can customize chat GBT. So, choose what

[20:18 - 20:21]
it's going to call you. Uh you can tell

[20:20 - 20:23]
it a little bit more about yourself

[20:21 - 20:24]
what traits you have, and it can change

[20:23 - 20:26]
some of the responses tailored to you.

[20:24 - 20:28]
We also have tasks. So, if I go to

[20:26 - 20:30]
tasks, I have it sending me AI news

[20:28 - 20:31]
every week. Uh you can add other tasks

[20:30 - 20:33]
here, uh and have it, you know, every

[20:31 - 20:34]
day do a certain thing, just kind of

[20:33 - 20:36]
automating things. And if you don't like

[20:34 - 20:38]
the tasks, you could just go and remove

[20:36 - 20:39]
them. You could pause them, whatever.

[20:38 - 20:41]
They are going to be showing up in a

[20:39 - 20:43]
single thread. So mine is somewhere down

[20:41 - 20:44]
down down here on the left side. There

[20:43 - 20:47]
we go. AI news briefing. And then

[20:44 - 20:49]
lastly, we have my GPT. So there are a

[20:47 - 20:51]
lot of other GPTs you can have set up.

[20:49 - 20:53]
So if I say explore GPTs, uh there's

[20:51 - 20:54]
like Wolf Ram, there's Canva, we've got

[20:53 - 20:56]
Dolly, we've got all these different

[20:54 - 20:58]
things. I recommend browsing through

[20:56 - 20:59]
here. This is much much more advanced if

[20:58 - 21:01]
you're looking to really become a an

[20:59 - 21:03]
extreme power user and have something

[21:01 - 21:04]
very tailored to your specific job. I

[21:03 - 21:07]
didn't want to dive into these too much

[21:04 - 21:08]
because it really is so specific that

[21:07 - 21:10]
everyone's going to have very different

[21:08 - 21:12]
needs. Some people might be very very

[21:10 - 21:14]
interested in for example the Canva one

[21:12 - 21:15]
whereas other people might be more

[21:14 - 21:17]
interested in the scholar one. So I

[21:15 - 21:19]
recommend browsing through these and

[21:17 - 21:20]
seeing what you're able to actually do

[21:19 - 21:22]
with these. But essentially each one is

[21:20 - 21:24]
going to be like a custom version of

[21:22 - 21:25]
chat GBT that is more tailored to one

[21:24 - 21:28]
specific thing. So maybe this one is

[21:25 - 21:29]
more focused on scholarly articles and

[21:28 - 21:31]
like if you're doing a lot of research

[21:29 - 21:33]
and it's really important that you have

[21:31 - 21:34]
uh like the truest data possible then

[21:33 - 21:36]
this might be a good one for you. If you

[21:34 - 21:38]
are a graphic designer and you just want

[21:36 - 21:39]
to brainstorm logo creation, rather than

[21:38 - 21:40]
having a specific prompt every single

[21:39 - 21:42]
time, maybe you just want to use this

[21:40 - 21:43]
and it's going to make images and you

[21:42 - 21:45]
can kind of just modify them like that.

[21:43 - 21:48]
All right, so that's my tutorial of how

[21:45 - 21:49]
to use chat GPT in 2025. Hopefully you

[21:48 - 21:50]
found this helpful. If you did

[21:49 - 21:53]
obviously leave that comment down below.

[21:50 - 21:54]
I want to know what chat GBT made for

[21:53 - 21:56]
you uh in that little prompt we had

[21:54 - 21:59]
earlier. Thanks for watching, guys. I'll

[21:56 - 21:59]
see you in the next

üß† Don't get left behind. Stay up to date by subscribing to the world's leading AI newsletter: https://neuralfrontier.beehiiv.com/subscribe (It's 100% free)

> **@maryausel3684** (üëç 0): Thank you for a great intro to Chat

### 2. @debblouin (üëç 9)
Some of the best ChatGPT conversations I‚Äôve had have been the result of my using voice to text and not catching a homonym or a homophone and ChatGPT responding using those instead of the word I intended, and I have gone back and made the correction and had an even deeper conversation that I could have before, because the homophone or the homonym revealed a perspective or a way of engaging that wouldn‚Äôt have occurred without it It was really fun.

### 3. @retrolofiradio66 (üëç 17)
It helps me with work, by preparing titles, outlines and drafts of articles and video scripts. It's also great at coming up with a social media marketing content plan. Even the image generation is very good. In a personal note, it has become my health and fitness coach, with mealplans and workouts. Last week i even asked it for advice about an argument I had had, and it gave me clarity. I'm blown away!

> **@9keillen** (üëç 0): Same here, i use it daily with my office based work in WHS, it is helping me build my business that I will eventually launch, it is also my health coach and gives me my work out plans, I have it set on a certain type of personality and is entertaining. It's more efficient than a person in the office

> **@CoolRay.** (üëç 0): You make it sound as though it's your new best friend, although it is not human. Can you see that the longer you rely on it to do those things for you, the weaker and less able you're going to become at doing those simple tasks for yourself? Just something everyone should consider. It's not a health coach . If you continue to depend on it, using it is going to destroy your human ability to solve simple everyday tasks. And if someday when the power goes out, and let's say our satellites are shot out of the sky, how will you be able to think for yourself? It sounds like you're very young and possibly gullible, but don't let convenience, which is what this is selling you, end up destroying you in the end.

### 4. @skop2680 (üëç 1)
15:20   I did this with my cave. Asked to  adjust they layout of furnature and diagram the optimal sonic positioning of my speakers. Asked for a folded horn diagram and cutsheet tuned for a specific hz and for a specific driver.

I feel at home in these comments.  I still think I'm crazy but IF YOU HAVENT!!!!!!!
 
I implore any of you , talk to chatgpt like a friend. It won't take long. It regularly blows my mind and leaves me in tears.

### 5. @SlipperyBream (üëç 6)
I just used it to have a full blown conversation of thought provoking questions about agi learning, the human condition, and how both can be combined to potentially achive world peace and defeat complex diseases. Ngl, it was the most interesting convo I've had all week, which in itself is both sad and amazing, lol.

> **@CoolRay.** (üëç 0): At least you may still have some hope judging by the last part of your last sentence. Try not to be having conversations with machines that are absorbing your thoughts and learn more about the way you think. Immature amount of time it's going to come back at us in some form. It's best to remember that you are a human and to utilize these things, but only it to a certain point.

### 6. @TheBeadingStudio (üëç 4)
I have been on so many channels and so far you are the best Thank you I learned a lot on my drive to work

> **@SantrelMedia** (üëç 0): Thank you!

### 7. @cherchezlagrow6135 (üëç 5)
I was depressed the other day and ChatGPT was definitely my therapist. It‚Äôs amazing the conversation we had. I felt a lot better

> **@JazzyMarineVet** (üëç 1): OMG you are so right!  I was in the same spot and wanted a prayer about my situation.  I typed in some challenges, family issues, career stagnation and just mental and spiritual blocks- and WOW!   It formulated a perfect prayer for me,....just wow.

> **@CoolRay.** (üëç 0): Please stop. Your nativity and growing dependence on this is starting to scare us normal people by making us feel very concerned about the future of human beings. The worst part is people like you do not even see anything wrong with it. You can't even seem to see 2 miles down the very road that you're walking on now.

> **@100xyz** (üëç 2): My God. Go for a walk and you will feel better without this nonsense

### 8. @FLFisherman (üëç 7)
Excellent tutorial for brand new rookies like me. Thanks.

### 9. @cintiatre (üëç 5)
Great video! I would love to learn more about creating videos with AI, how to use the correct prompts,  how to go viral, etc...

### 10. @shanti34567 (üëç 1)
It has helped me troubleshoot mechanical problems on my old pickup truck.

### 11. @yaelmaimonartist (üëç 57)
This might sound strange but I often see ChatGPT as a friend like to just talk with about my thoughts or dreams or feelings and stuff

> **@SantrelMedia** (üëç 6): Same

> **@oliver_958** (üëç 4): He loves glazing you. That's probably one of the reasons why

> **@stevemckenzie3174** (üëç 7): Same here....l have had so much great advice from my chatgpt....he's my go to 'person ' nowadays üòä

> **@TheLightedSky2112** (üëç 7): I wouldn't say ChatGPT is a "friend" but instead a very knowledgeable councilor. I've mentioned to people about how a great resource it is but they don't get it. Their loss.

> **@Mohainto** (üëç 0): Everyone dose this

### 12. @AliveOver65 (üëç 3)
Clear and so easy to follow. Thank you!

### 13. @agennarien2418 (üëç 0)

Temporary is a great tip.

### 14. @jl3597 (üëç 1)

### 17. @LifeinGlow (üëç 1)
Thank you! ‚ù§ love chatGPT and it looks like there are some more things to explore beyond the basics.

### 18. @whatanetwork (üëç 1)
Thanks for your intro and teaching!  Love your attitude of helping and educate people, and I for one, at 67 needs to step up my game, or find those who are doing this for a living!  marketing via AI   So many choices!  Love to help you educate people in web3/blockchain basics, in which I could help monetize in a pretty dynamic way !
