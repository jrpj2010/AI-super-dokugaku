personalized

[03:04 - 03:12]
touch so why wait Empower yourself with

[03:08 - 03:15]
chat GPT today imagine having a chat

[03:12 - 03:18]
with an AI that feels like talking to a

[03:15 - 03:21]
real person that's what chat gbt does

[03:18 - 03:23]
chat gbt stands for chat generative

[03:21 - 03:26]
pre-trained Transformer developed by

[03:23 - 03:29]
open AI it is an artificial intelligence

[03:26 - 03:32]
model based on the technology called

[03:29 - 03:36]
Transformer which is particularly good

[03:32 - 03:40]
at processing and generating humanlike

[03:36 - 03:43]
text it's a version of what's known as

[03:40 - 03:47]
language model because it can predict

[03:43 - 03:51]
and generate sequences of words based on

[03:47 - 03:53]
the input it receives now let's dive

[03:51 - 03:57]
into some of the buzzword you have

[03:53 - 04:01]
likely heard about generative AI large

[03:57 - 04:04]
language model that is llms and GPT

[04:01 - 04:08]
these terms might sound complex but they

[04:04 - 04:11]
form the foundation of how child GPT

[04:08 - 04:14]
works in the next few segments we will

[04:11 - 04:17]
break down these Concepts in an easy to

[04:14 - 04:22]
understand way so you can grasp the

[04:17 - 04:26]
magic of the technology behind chat

[04:22 - 04:29]
gbt let's get started so let's start

[04:26 - 04:30]
with quickly understanding the evolution

[04:29 - 04:32]
of computers

[04:30 - 04:36]
when the computers were created they

[04:32 - 04:37]
were created as calculating machines for

[04:36 - 04:41]
mathematicians and

[04:37 - 04:43]
bookkeepers then it evolved to

[04:41 - 04:45]
understanding programming languages so

[04:43 - 04:48]
that it can understand instructions

[04:45 - 04:50]
human instructions but now it has

[04:48 - 04:53]
evolved to

[04:50 - 04:56]
incorporating humanlike intelligence as

[04:53 - 04:58]
well as creativity mimicking humanlike

[04:56 - 05:00]
intelligence is nothing but artificial

[04:58 - 05:03]
intelligence and and artificial

[05:00 - 05:07]
intelligence combined with creativity is

[05:03 - 05:09]
nothing but generative AI so let me make

[05:07 - 05:12]
you understand with a very simple

[05:09 - 05:16]
example what is generative AI transport

[05:12 - 05:19]
yourself back to your childhood you had

[05:16 - 05:23]
a lot and lot of toys to play with you

[05:19 - 05:26]
would keep that toys in one box now also

[05:23 - 05:28]
imagine that if you wanted some toy

[05:26 - 05:32]
which is different you would not get in

[05:28 - 05:36]
the market but what if I tell you that

[05:32 - 05:39]
this box is a magical box and if you

[05:36 - 05:44]
input your understanding of what you

[05:39 - 05:47]
want in your new toy with instructions

[05:44 - 05:50]
it can create a new toy for you which is

[05:47 - 05:55]
not available in the market now this toy

[05:50 - 05:58]
can be a beer with unicorn features and

[05:55 - 06:01]
wings what if it generates for you this

[05:58 - 06:04]
magical box generates Ates a toy which

[06:01 - 06:07]
is very unique for you this magical box

[06:04 - 06:11]
is nothing but generative AI generative

[06:07 - 06:14]
AI actually is not a magic it's a fast

[06:11 - 06:17]
and rapidly evolving artificial

[06:14 - 06:21]
intelligence system which creates

[06:17 - 06:27]
generates transforms content that can be

[06:21 - 06:30]
text video audio image Etc based on your

[06:27 - 06:33]
input so if you want to understand it

[06:30 - 06:37]
technically generative AI or gen AI

[06:33 - 06:41]
functions by employing a neural network

[06:37 - 06:44]
to analyze data patterns and generates

[06:41 - 06:47]
new content based on those patterns

[06:44 - 06:50]
neural networks are nothing but a

[06:47 - 06:54]
mimicry or a replication of your

[06:50 - 06:56]
biological neuron based on how it gets

[06:54 - 06:59]
from brain the activity from brain and

[06:56 - 07:02]
you do your work it's nothing but a

[06:59 - 07:06]
mimic M of that based on that mimicry it

[07:02 - 07:10]
analyzes data patterns and generates new

[07:06 - 07:12]
content for you let's Now quickly see

[07:10 - 07:16]
what is the difference between

[07:12 - 07:19]
discriminative and generative AI suppose

[07:16 - 07:24]
you have a data set of different images

[07:19 - 07:27]
of dogs cats you provide this as a input

[07:24 - 07:30]
to your discriminative AI which acts

[07:27 - 07:34]
like a judge and it classifies is all

[07:30 - 07:37]
this into set of images between cats and

[07:34 - 07:40]
dogs this is discriminative AI it

[07:37 - 07:43]
classifies now let's understand what is

[07:40 - 07:48]
generative AI you have the similar set

[07:43 - 07:52]
of cats and dogs but now your generative

[07:48 - 07:55]
AI is acting like an artist it creates a

[07:52 - 07:59]
new species of dogs for you that's why

[07:55 - 08:02]
generative AI is nothing but AI system

[07:59 - 08:05]
that transform creates generates your

[08:02 - 08:08]
own content based on your instructions

[08:05 - 08:11]
like an artist now that you have

[08:08 - 08:13]
understood what is discriminative AI and

[08:11 - 08:15]
what is generative Ai and what is the

[08:13 - 08:19]
difference between the two let's

[08:15 - 08:23]
understand why is generative AI or gen

[08:19 - 08:28]
AI trending gen AI has impacted various

[08:23 - 08:32]
Fields be it text audio video any input

[08:28 - 08:35]
and those inputs in various domains like

[08:32 - 08:37]
data management Tech Healthcare and

[08:35 - 08:41]
entertainment it has creative

[08:37 - 08:44]
application such as Del chat GPT where

[08:41 - 08:47]
you can input what you want and get

[08:44 - 08:50]
output from it for example if you want

[08:47 - 08:53]
to create an image what you think or

[08:50 - 08:57]
perceive as a concept and you want it

[08:53 - 09:00]
you give a prompt for your generative AI

[08:57 - 09:03]
model and it will create that that image

[09:00 - 09:05]
for you so your input is a text but your

[09:03 - 09:08]
output is an image that's why it's

[09:05 - 09:11]
trending it does not depend how

[09:08 - 09:14]
traditional AI is dependent on what form

[09:11 - 09:18]
of input you give the same form would be

[09:14 - 09:21]
your output however gen AI works on your

[09:18 - 09:24]
inputs on your instructions that's why

[09:21 - 09:27]
it's trending it is impacting a lot of

[09:24 - 09:29]
fields be it creative field be it

[09:27 - 09:32]
research field be it business

[09:29 - 09:36]
professionals are using tools like chat

[09:32 - 09:38]
GPT to create or generate code so that

[09:36 - 09:41]
they can create something new the

[09:38 - 09:44]
researchers are actually developing new

[09:41 - 09:47]
and new large language models based on

[09:44 - 09:52]
which we can create new generative

[09:47 - 09:55]
models and can do new and new task each

[09:52 - 09:57]
and every day that's why generative AI

[09:55 - 10:02]
is evolving

[09:57 - 10:04]
rapidly and that's why is close to Magic

[10:02 - 10:07]
for everyone now that you have

[10:04 - 10:11]
understood why it is trending now let's

[10:07 - 10:14]
understand how it works we give an input

[10:11 - 10:17]
to generative models gen AI works on

[10:14 - 10:22]
generative models we give an input it

[10:17 - 10:26]
can be text audio video any format those

[10:22 - 10:31]
generative models are then preened on

[10:26 - 10:33]
the data and they are fin tuned to do

[10:31 - 10:36]
the task that you want it can be Tech

[10:33 - 10:38]
summarization it can be sentiment

[10:36 - 10:40]
analysis it can be image generation it

[10:38 - 10:43]
can be audio generation for your YouTube

[10:40 - 10:46]
channel or analyzing your customer

[10:43 - 10:49]
feedback if you are a brand or a

[10:46 - 10:51]
marketing firm it can create codes

[10:49 - 10:55]
whatever you want you give a prompt what

[10:51 - 10:58]
you want explaining it that what you

[10:55 - 11:01]
want and it fine tunes and gives you

[10:58 - 11:04]
that task for you so this is how in

[11:01 - 11:06]
nutshell generative AI model works so

[11:04 - 11:10]
now let's see what are the different

[11:06 - 11:14]
types of generative AI first one is

[11:10 - 11:17]
generative adversarial Network Gans it's

[11:14 - 11:19]
a type of AI where two models one

[11:17 - 11:23]
generating the content and one judging

[11:19 - 11:26]
it work together to produce realistic

[11:23 - 11:30]
new data second is variational

[11:26 - 11:35]
autoencoders this AI learns to recreate

[11:30 - 11:39]
and generate new similar data third is

[11:35 - 11:43]
Transformers Transformers is an AI which

[11:39 - 11:46]
learns to produce sequences using

[11:43 - 11:49]
context fourth is diffusion model which

[11:46 - 11:54]
generates data by refining noisy

[11:49 - 11:55]
starting until it looks realistic now

[11:54 - 11:58]
that you have understood what are the

[11:55 - 12:00]
different types of generative AI let's

[11:58 - 12:02]
quickly watch work through different

[12:00 - 12:05]
applications of generative a app first

[12:02 - 12:09]
one is content generation it creates it

[12:05 - 12:11]
generates whatever textual or any code

[12:09 - 12:14]
that you want customer support and

[12:11 - 12:16]
engagement if you are brand firm it

[12:14 - 12:19]
helps you with that data analysis and

[12:16 - 12:23]
data science it helps with visualization

[12:19 - 12:25]
it helps with analyzing any data it be

[12:23 - 12:28]
it any data you want you are a brand

[12:25 - 12:31]
firm or you are a technology firm it

[12:28 - 12:36]
will help you analyze your data and

[12:31 - 12:39]
create new automated task for you or it

[12:36 - 12:42]
would create new perceptions for you to

[12:39 - 12:44]
take over then it is code generation and

[12:42 - 12:47]
software development we have research

[12:44 - 12:50]
and information retrieval as well where

[12:47 - 12:53]
it helps different researchers it helps

[12:50 - 12:56]
different professionals to grow and

[12:53 - 12:58]
retrieve extract information required

[12:56 - 13:01]
from different or various data sources

[12:58 - 13:03]
then we have machine translation if you

[13:01 - 13:05]
are a person who do not understand a

[13:03 - 13:06]
language and you're watching something

[13:05 - 13:09]
or reading something which is in

[13:06 - 13:13]
different language you can use

[13:09 - 13:17]
generative models to translate text or

[13:13 - 13:19]
audio or anything into the language that

[13:17 - 13:22]
you require then we have sentiment

[13:19 - 13:25]
analysis which actually takes feedbacks

[13:22 - 13:28]
or any text that you have to give you is

[13:25 - 13:29]
it a positive negative or neutral

[13:28 - 13:32]
sentiment

[13:29 - 13:35]
and so that you can analyze and take

[13:32 - 13:38]
decisive decisions other domains here

[13:35 - 13:41]
include Healthcare transport everywhere

[13:38 - 13:44]
it helps generative models generative AI

[13:41 - 13:47]
is helping each and every domain in

[13:44 - 13:52]
their perspective how they are applying

[13:47 - 13:55]
this technology change in their domain

[13:52 - 13:57]
so let's Now quickly conclude what we

[13:55 - 14:00]
have learned in this video we learned AI

[13:57 - 14:03]
is a super set we have a subset called

[14:00 - 14:06]
machine learning which trains your

[14:03 - 14:09]
machines to do what you want but there

[14:06 - 14:11]
the machines need your input deep

[14:09 - 14:14]
learning is a subset of machine learning

[14:11 - 14:17]
which incorporates neural networks which

[14:14 - 14:20]
mimics your neurons so that it can

[14:17 - 14:23]
imitate human intelligence then comes

[14:20 - 14:26]
generative AI which involves creativity

[14:23 - 14:29]
introduces creativity in artificial

[14:26 - 14:32]
intelligence system then comes large

[14:29 - 14:36]
language models large language models

[14:32 - 14:39]
are basic bits that you will learn in

[14:36 - 14:42]
our upcoming videos so stay tuned just

[14:39 - 14:45]
before we conclude let me tell you

[14:42 - 14:47]
different generative AI tools which are

[14:45 - 14:50]
in the market and which you can explore

[14:47 - 14:53]
some of it are charity by open AI clawed

[14:50 - 14:56]
by anthropic AI co-pilot by GitHub

[14:53 - 14:59]
Gemini by Google you can go and explore

[14:56 - 15:02]
the world however stay tuned to our our

[14:59 - 15:05]
channel so that you can learn more about

[15:02 - 15:07]
generative AI large language models

[15:05 - 15:10]
prompt engineering and several different

[15:07 - 15:12]
buzzwords that are there in the system

[15:10 - 15:15]
what exactly is an

[15:12 - 15:19]
llm imagine you have a super smart

[15:15 - 15:22]
friend who has read every book article

[15:19 - 15:25]
and blog post in the world this friend

[15:22 - 15:27]
can chat with you about almost anything

[15:25 - 15:31]
help you with your homework write

[15:27 - 15:34]
stories and even tell you jokes that's

[15:31 - 15:37]
pretty much what an llm does in

[15:34 - 15:40]
technical terms an llm is a type of

[15:37 - 15:45]
artificial intelligence that has been

[15:40 - 15:48]
trained on vast amounts of data it can

[15:45 - 15:51]
understand and generate humanik text

[15:48 - 15:55]
based on the pattern it has learned from

[15:51 - 15:58]
all that reading this is part of a

[15:55 - 16:00]
broader field called generative AI which

[15:58 - 16:05]
focuses on creating content that

[16:00 - 16:06]
resembles human output let's now break

[16:05 - 16:11]
down the

[16:06 - 16:13]
basics large language and model large

[16:11 - 16:17]
just means that the model has been

[16:13 - 16:19]
trained with a massive amount of data we

[16:17 - 16:24]
are talking about billions of words from

[16:19 - 16:28]
books websites articles and more model

[16:24 - 16:32]
refers to a set of instructions or

[16:28 - 16:36]
algorithms that helps the AI understand

[16:32 - 16:40]
and generate language think of it like a

[16:36 - 16:43]
recipe that guides how to make a cake in

[16:40 - 16:47]
this case it is guiding the AI on how to

[16:43 - 16:50]
create meaningful text let's talk about

[16:47 - 16:53]
language this is all about words

[16:50 - 16:56]
sentences and how we

[16:53 - 16:59]
communicate when you text your friends

[16:56 - 17:03]
write an email or post on social media

[16:59 - 17:07]
you are using language so now that you

[17:03 - 17:10]
understand what each word in llm stands

[17:07 - 17:12]
for let's quickly see what is the

[17:10 - 17:16]
technical

[17:12 - 17:19]
definition llms are language models made

[17:16 - 17:22]
up of neural network with billions of

[17:19 - 17:26]
parameters that are trained by selfs

[17:22 - 17:30]
supervis learning on vast amounts of

[17:26 - 17:34]
unlabeled text now let's dive into how

[17:30 - 17:38]
do llms work let's simplify this with an

[17:34 - 17:41]
example imagine you type the sky is dash

[17:38 - 17:45]
dash dash the llm might predict the next

[17:41 - 17:48]
word to be blue because it has seen that

[17:45 - 17:52]
phrase so many times during its training

[17:48 - 17:56]
large language models like gp4 operate

[17:52 - 17:59]
based on complex neural networks trained

[17:56 - 18:03]
on vast amounts of Text data here is a

[17:59 - 18:06]
simplified explanation of how they work

[18:03 - 18:08]
in two phases the first phase is the

[18:06 - 18:13]
training phase followed by the inference

[18:08 - 18:16]
phase the training phase has four steps

[18:13 - 18:21]
step one data collection that is

[18:16 - 18:24]
gathering diverse text Data from various

[18:21 - 18:28]
sources step two pre-processing which

[18:24 - 18:31]
means cleaning and tokenizing Text data

[18:28 - 18:34]
in into numerical representations step

[18:31 - 18:37]
three model architecture which is

[18:34 - 18:41]
nothing but designing the neural network

[18:37 - 18:44]
structure typically a Transformer step

[18:41 - 18:47]
four training is adjusting model

[18:44 - 18:50]
parameters by predicting the next word

[18:47 - 18:54]
in sentences by this training phase the

[18:50 - 18:57]
llms are being trained on vast amount of

[18:54 - 19:00]
data to do further

[18:57 - 19:04]
predictions now now coming to the next

[19:00 - 19:08]
phase which is inference phase it also

[19:04 - 19:11]
has four steps step one input processing

[19:08 - 19:14]
that means tokenizing and converting the

[19:11 - 19:17]
input text into embeddings step two

[19:14 - 19:21]
generating output Now using the model to

[19:17 - 19:25]
predict and generate the next words step

[19:21 - 19:27]
three sampling which is selecting words

[19:25 - 19:31]
from predicted probability distribution

[19:27 - 19:33]
step four last but not the least

[19:31 - 19:37]
postprocessing which means converting

[19:33 - 19:39]
generated tokens back to readable text

[19:37 - 19:42]
after the training phase in the

[19:39 - 19:46]
inference phase the llms will recognize

[19:42 - 19:50]
the pattern sample content and give

[19:46 - 19:53]
predictions apart from these steps there

[19:50 - 19:55]
are three key Concepts which we should

[19:53 - 20:00]
know to demystify

[19:55 - 20:02]
llms First attention mechan ISM this

[20:00 - 20:07]
allows the model to focus on relevant

[20:02 - 20:09]
part of the input text improving its

[20:07 - 20:12]
understanding of context and

[20:09 - 20:14]
meaning second

[20:12 - 20:18]
embeddings which are numerical

[20:14 - 20:20]
representation of words or tokens that

[20:18 - 20:23]
capture their meaning and

[20:20 - 20:27]
relationship third

[20:23 - 20:29]
Transformers Transformers are the

[20:27 - 20:33]
architecture that you uses self

[20:29 - 20:36]
attention to process input data in

[20:33 - 20:39]
parallel making it efficient and more

[20:36 - 20:43]
powerful let's see some examples of llms

[20:39 - 20:46]
in action example one chatting your

[20:43 - 20:50]
prompt can be what is the capital of

[20:46 - 20:53]
Japan llm replies the capital of Japan

[20:50 - 20:56]
is Tokyo llm knows this because it has

[20:53 - 20:59]
read a lot of information about

[20:56 - 21:02]
countries and capitals let's say example

[20:59 - 21:07]
two about writing your prompt can be can

[21:02 - 21:09]
you help me write a story llm says sure

[21:07 - 21:12]
once upon a time in a land far away

[21:09 - 21:16]
there was a brave knight who dash dash

[21:12 - 21:18]
dash the llm can generate creative text

[21:16 - 21:20]
based on what it has learned from

[21:18 - 21:22]
reading

[21:20 - 21:23]
stories example three let's see

[21:22 - 21:27]
answering

[21:23 - 21:30]
questions your prompt can be explain

[21:27 - 21:33]
photosynthesis in simple terms llm

[21:30 - 21:37]
replies photosynthesis is a process by

[21:33 - 21:40]
which plants use sunlight to make food

[21:37 - 21:43]
from carbon dioxide and water it

[21:40 - 21:46]
simplifies complex Topics by using the

[21:43 - 21:48]
patterns it has learned from educational

[21:46 - 21:53]
content there are different types of

[21:48 - 21:56]
llms each designed for specific task and

[21:53 - 22:00]
application now let's explore these

[21:56 - 22:03]
types first are base models they are

[22:00 - 22:06]
trained on a wide range of data and can

[22:03 - 22:09]
perform General language understanding

[22:06 - 22:13]
and generation task they aren't

[22:09 - 22:15]
specialized for any particular type of

[22:13 - 22:18]
instructions but are

[22:15 - 22:21]
versatile for example

[22:18 - 22:24]
gpt3 which is known for its versatility

[22:21 - 22:28]
and ability to generate coherent and

[22:24 - 22:30]
contextually relevant text another type

[22:28 - 22:34]
is instruction based

[22:30 - 22:37]
models they are fine-tuned to follow

[22:34 - 22:41]
Specific Instructions better than base

[22:37 - 22:45]
models they can understand and execute

[22:41 - 22:46]
tasks based on detailed prompts given by

[22:45 - 22:52]
the

[22:46 - 22:53]
user for example T5 that is text to text

[22:52 - 22:57]
transfer

[22:53 - 23:01]
Transformer it converts all NLP problems

[22:57 - 23:05]
into a textto text format making it

[23:01 - 23:08]
highly versatile for tasks like

[23:05 - 23:11]
translation summarization and question

[23:08 - 23:15]
answering another example is instruct

[23:11 - 23:19]
GPT which is tailored to follow specific

[23:15 - 23:21]
user instructions better and provide

[23:19 - 23:25]
more useful and safe

[23:21 - 23:29]
responses so these were the types of

[23:25 - 23:33]
llms however there are paid and

[23:29 - 23:36]
open-source llms as well in the market

[23:33 - 23:40]
based on your usage and budget you can

[23:36 - 23:43]
explore them some paid llms are

[23:40 - 23:49]
gbt440 Microsoft Azure open AI Services

[23:43 - 23:52]
Etc and open source are GPT Neo Bert Etc

[23:49 - 23:55]
let's see how are llms revolutionizing

[23:52 - 23:58]
the world of AI in education they can

[23:55 - 24:02]
help explain difficult Concepts and

[23:58 - 24:05]
answer questions and even tutor students

[24:02 - 24:08]
in content creation they assist writers

[24:05 - 24:12]
marketers creators by creating

[24:08 - 24:14]
generating ideas drafting content and

[24:12 - 24:17]
editing encoding the assist

[24:14 - 24:20]
professionals with generating code to

[24:17 - 24:24]
their specific problems in Customer

[24:20 - 24:27]
Support many companies use llms to power

[24:24 - 24:29]
their chat Bots providing quick and

[24:27 - 24:33]
accurate respon answers to their

[24:29 - 24:37]
customer inquiries apart from all these

[24:33 - 24:38]
fields llms are being utilized in every

[24:37 - 24:43]
field and

[24:38 - 24:45]
domain but it's not all smooth sailing

[24:43 - 24:48]
there are challenges

[24:45 - 24:49]
too let's see one such challenge which

[24:48 - 24:53]
is

[24:49 - 24:57]
bias since llms learn from Human written

[24:53 - 25:00]
text they can pick up and reproduce

[24:57 - 25:02]
biases present in the data another one

[25:00 - 25:04]
is

[25:02 - 25:07]
misinformation they can sometimes

[25:04 - 25:10]
provide incorrect or misleading

[25:07 - 25:12]
information especially if the data they

[25:10 - 25:16]
were trained on was

[25:12 - 25:19]
flawed however keeping challenges aside

[25:16 - 25:23]
the future of llms is exciting as they

[25:19 - 25:26]
continue to improve we can expect them

[25:23 - 25:30]
to become even more accurate reliable

[25:26 - 25:33]
and versatile they will be better at

[25:30 - 25:36]
understanding context handling complex

[25:33 - 25:40]
tasks and even learning from smaller

[25:36 - 25:44]
amounts of data so there you have it

[25:40 - 25:48]
large language models llms are like

[25:44 - 25:51]
super smart friends powered by tons of

[25:48 - 25:55]
data and advanced algorithms they can

[25:51 - 25:58]
chat write and help us in countless ways

[25:55 - 26:01]
as they continue to evolve they are set

[25:58 - 26:05]
to become even more integral in our

[26:01 - 26:08]
daily lives first let's break down GPT

[26:05 - 26:11]
generative pre-trained Transformer in

[26:08 - 26:12]
simple terms imagine teaching a friend

[26:11 - 26:16]
to write

[26:12 - 26:19]
stories you would first give them tons

[26:16 - 26:23]
of books to read right that's exactly

[26:19 - 26:27]
what we do with GPT we feed it a huge

[26:23 - 26:29]
amount of text from books articles and

[26:27 - 26:31]
websites this this is called

[26:29 - 26:35]
pre-training during pre-training GPT

[26:31 - 26:39]
learns the basics of language that is

[26:35 - 26:43]
grammar sentence structure and even some

[26:39 - 26:47]
facts about the world it's like the AI

[26:43 - 26:50]
is soaking up all this knowledge GPT is

[26:47 - 26:52]
built using a special architecture

[26:50 - 26:55]
called a

[26:52 - 26:57]
Transformer specifically the decoder

[26:55 - 27:01]
part of the Transformer this structure

[26:57 - 27:05]
is is really good at understanding the

[27:01 - 27:06]
context of the words for example it

[27:05 - 27:11]
knows the difference

[27:06 - 27:15]
between apple the fruit and apple the

[27:11 - 27:19]
company based on the surrounding words

[27:15 - 27:23]
the Transformer decoder has

[27:19 - 27:26]
layers imagine a sandwich each layer

[27:23 - 27:29]
processes information and passes it to

[27:26 - 27:32]
the next layer getting more refined with

[27:29 - 27:36]
each step this helps GPT understand and

[27:32 - 27:40]
generate humanik text now when you give

[27:36 - 27:43]
GPD a prompt like once upon a time it

[27:40 - 27:46]
uses everything it learned to predict

[27:43 - 27:49]
and generate the next part of the story

[27:46 - 27:53]
one word at a time it's like a super

[27:49 - 27:56]
smart autocomplete you can use GPT for a

[27:53 - 28:00]
lot of cool things writing essays coding

[27:56 - 28:03]
help creating content and even chatting

[28:00 - 28:06]

how it can benefit you in various

[42:30 - 42:36]
aspects of your daily routine while Char

[42:33 - 42:40]
GPT is an incredible tool with many

[42:36 - 42:44]
users it's important to understand its

[42:40 - 42:48]
limitations let's explore some of the

[42:44 - 42:52]
key areas where chat GPT may fall

[42:48 - 42:55]
short firstly accuracy and

[42:52 - 42:58]
reliability Chad giib generates

[42:55 - 43:01]
responses based on patterns in the data

[42:58 - 43:04]
it was trained on but it doesn't

[43:01 - 43:07]
understand the world like a human does

[43:04 - 43:09]
this means it can sometimes provide

[43:07 - 43:12]
incorrect or misleading

[43:09 - 43:16]
information always double check critical

[43:12 - 43:17]
information from reliable sources next

[43:16 - 43:21]
context

[43:17 - 43:25]
awareness CH GPT tries to maintain

[43:21 - 43:29]
context within a conversation but it can

[43:25 - 43:32]
struggle with long or complex

[43:29 - 43:36]
dialogues it might forget what was said

[43:32 - 43:40]
before in the conversation or not catch

[43:36 - 43:43]
the subtle hints from previous chats

[43:40 - 43:47]
another important limitation is

[43:43 - 43:51]
bias chat gbt May unintentionally show

[43:47 - 43:55]
biases because it learns from internet

[43:51 - 43:59]
data this includes cultural social and

[43:55 - 44:03]
gender biases it's crucial to use chat

[43:59 - 44:05]
GPT critically and be aware of potential

[44:03 - 44:08]
biases in its

[44:05 - 44:12]
responses ethical concerns also arise

[44:08 - 44:15]
with ch GPT for instance it can be used

[44:12 - 44:19]
to generate misleading and harmful

[44:15 - 44:23]
content there are ongoing discussions

[44:19 - 44:27]
about the responsible use of AI and

[44:23 - 44:30]
ensuring that Technologies like chat GPT

[44:27 - 44:33]
are used ethically chat gpt's

[44:30 - 44:37]
performance heavily depends on the

[44:33 - 44:41]
quality of the input it receives vague

[44:37 - 44:44]
or poorly phrased questions can lead to

[44:41 - 44:48]
equally vague or irrelevant

[44:44 - 44:51]
answers clear concise prompts yield the

[44:48 - 44:54]
best results so practice refining your

[44:51 - 44:58]
questions for optimal

[44:54 - 45:02]
interactions unlike humans chity lacks

[44:58 - 45:06]
common sense and emotional understanding

[45:02 - 45:09]
it can simulate empathy but doesn't

[45:06 - 45:11]
truly understand emotions or have real

[45:09 - 45:14]
world

[45:11 - 45:17]
experiences this can make its responses

[45:14 - 45:20]
feel unnatural or

[45:17 - 45:24]
inappropriate insensitive

[45:20 - 45:27]
contexts remember chat GP is purely a

[45:24 - 45:30]
text based AI it can notot perform

[45:27 - 45:33]
physical task or interact with the real

[45:30 - 45:37]
world it can provide guidance or

[45:33 - 45:40]
instructions but actual execution

[45:37 - 45:43]
requires human intervention privacy and

[45:40 - 45:45]
security are also critical

[45:43 - 45:48]
considerations be cautious about sharing

[45:45 - 45:52]
sensitive personal information with Chad

[45:48 - 45:54]
GP as interactions may be stored and

[45:52 - 45:57]
used to improve the model always

[45:54 - 46:01]
prioritize your privacy and

[45:57 - 46:04]
security finally there's the risk of

[46:01 - 46:06]
dependency relying too heavily on chat

[46:04 - 46:09]
gbd for answers can hinder your own

[46:06 - 46:13]
critical thinking and problem solving

[46:09 - 46:16]
it's a great tool for assistance but

[46:13 - 46:19]
it's essential to use it as a complement

[46:16 - 46:22]
to your own knowledge and

[46:19 - 46:25]
abilities we have covered the basics and

[46:22 - 46:27]
practical uses but now it's time to

[46:25 - 46:32]
explore the different world versions of

[46:27 - 46:35]
chat GPT and what makes each one special

[46:32 - 46:40]
first we'll dive into chat GPT

[46:35 - 46:42]
3.5 what sets it apart and why it is a

[46:40 - 46:45]
favorite for many

[46:42 - 46:49]
users then we'll look at the

[46:45 - 46:54]
advancements in chat GPT 4 how does it

[46:49 - 46:58]
improve on its predecessor and what new

[46:54 - 47:02]
features does it bring to the table next

[46:58 - 47:04]
we'll unveil the PowerHouse of chat GPT

[47:02 - 47:08]
chat GPT

[47:04 - 47:10]
40 discover why it's considered the next

[47:08 - 47:13]
big leap in AI

[47:10 - 47:18]
technology and the best part we will

[47:13 - 47:21]
show you how to use chat GPD 40 for free

[47:18 - 47:24]
Yes you heard that right get all the

[47:21 - 47:29]
benefits without the cost stay tuned

[47:24 - 47:32]
because you won't want to miss this deep

[47:29 - 47:34]
dive into the evolution of chat GPT next

[47:32 - 47:36]
let's look at something that most people

[47:34 - 47:40]
are interested in when it comes to chart

[47:36 - 47:43]
GPT coding chart GPT is capable of

[47:40 - 47:47]
creating codes from scratch for various

[47:43 - 47:49]
use cases and also in various languages

[47:47 - 47:52]
now please remember that Chad GPT has

[47:49 - 47:55]
the capability to code anything even

[47:52 - 47:57]
malicious software so be very careful

[47:55 - 48:00]
while you're using chat GP PT because

[47:57 - 48:03]
even though chat GPT provided you with

[48:00 - 48:05]
the answers it would only do so on

[48:03 - 48:08]
prompting so you are ethically and

[48:05 - 48:11]
legally required to use chart GPT only

[48:08 - 48:14]
for legitimate uses please do not use

[48:11 - 48:18]
them for coding or creating malicious or

[48:14 - 48:20]
hacking softwares anyways going on to

[48:18 - 48:23]
the actual point here we can actually

[48:20 - 48:26]
use CH GPT for coding anything and

[48:23 - 48:29]
everything in a particular limit or

[48:26 - 48:33]
boundary so Chad GPT is very good in

[48:29 - 48:38]
those terms for example let us ask Chad

[48:33 - 48:42]
GPT to create a code for something known

[48:38 - 48:44]
as the ranga algorithm now this is

[48:42 - 48:47]
actually a mathematical

[48:44 - 48:49]
algorithm uh some of you might have

[48:47 - 48:51]
heard about it some of you might not

[48:49 - 48:54]
have heard about it that's absolutely

[48:51 - 48:56]
fine and another thing I would like to

[48:54 - 48:59]
actually tell you here is as you can see

[48:56 - 49:01]
the spelling of algorithm was wrong but

[48:59 - 49:03]
chat GPT understands that interprets it

[49:01 - 49:06]
appropriately and gives you the exact

[49:03 - 49:09]
answer that you want even as you can see

[49:06 - 49:13]
I have typed the name of the algorithm

[49:09 - 49:16]
there is a typo there but chart GP

[49:13 - 49:19]
understands that and again rectifies it

[49:16 - 49:21]
now here by default chart GPT starts

[49:19 - 49:24]
coding in Python but if you want you

[49:21 - 49:27]
could also give it a different prompt or

[49:24 - 49:30]
a more delineated prompt stating

[49:27 - 49:34]
that we want a codee for this particular

[49:30 - 49:37]
algorithm in say C++ or even C for that

[49:34 - 49:40]
matter so let us see here it has created

[49:37 - 49:42]
the code in Python and if we give this

[49:40 - 49:46]
particular prompt the code would start

[49:42 - 49:49]
getting generated in C++ so not only

[49:46 - 49:51]
does it code the algorithm it also codes

[49:49 - 49:55]
the algorithm in various languages as

[49:51 - 49:58]
per our requirement not only this we can

[49:55 - 50:01]
also specify the kind of complexities

[49:58 - 50:02]
that we want now anyone who is in coding

[50:01 - 50:04]
or into algorithms you would know

[50:02 - 50:07]
exactly what a complexity is we've got

[50:04 - 50:09]
time complexity space complexity so we

[50:07 - 50:12]
can actually give those kinds of prompts

[50:09 - 50:14]
also so if I want the code to be

[50:12 - 50:19]
generated

[50:14 - 50:21]
in worst case time

[50:19 - 50:23]
complexity again please don't mind the

[50:21 - 50:26]
spellings because chat GPT is actually

[50:23 - 50:28]
going to correct that so as you can see

[50:26 - 50:30]
implemented in o n where n is the number

[50:28 - 50:32]
of steps to take this is this is

[50:30 - 50:34]
actually the worst case time complexity

[50:32 - 50:36]
not only is it explaining what the worst

[50:34 - 50:38]
case time complexity is it will also

[50:36 - 50:40]
generate the code for the worst case

[50:38 - 50:42]
time complexity in a similar manner you

[50:40 - 50:45]
can also generate a code for best case

[50:42 - 50:48]
time complexity at the end of it Char

[50:45 - 50:50]
GPT is able to generate a code not only

[50:48 - 50:52]
that it is able to generate the code

[50:50 - 50:55]
based upon our specifications that we

[50:52 - 50:57]
have provided in the prompt so it takes

[50:55 - 50:59]
those keywords very serious L and it

[50:57 - 51:02]
implements those keywords within the

[50:59 - 51:04]
code now please remember do not use this

[51:02 - 51:07]
for homework because this is where you

[51:04 - 51:10]
are actually supposed to use your

[51:07 - 51:13]
capabilities yes you can use this if you

[51:10 - 51:15]
are trying to implement some very high

[51:13 - 51:18]
level software wherein this plays a very

[51:15 - 51:21]
small part but remember direct copy

[51:18 - 51:24]
pasting of any type of code or text from

[51:21 - 51:27]
chat GPT onto wherever your application

[51:24 - 51:29]
is is not the solution you do need to

[51:27 - 51:31]
change something in order to avoid any

[51:29 - 51:34]
kind of plagarism or

[51:31 - 51:38]
copyright infringement so that's how we

[51:34 - 51:40]
can use chat GPT for coding now this can

[51:38 - 51:43]
be used in various places this can be

[51:40 - 51:46]
actually used in various industry use

[51:43 - 51:49]
cases also where we need to generate

[51:46 - 51:51]
multiple modules that need to be

[51:49 - 51:52]
collaborated or that need to be collated

[51:51 - 51:56]
into one single module and we don't have

[51:52 - 51:58]
enough time this would come in handy not

[51:56 - 52:01]
only this we could actually also convert

[51:58 - 52:03]
a given set of code from one language to

[52:01 - 52:06]
the other so as you can see I've written

[52:03 - 52:13]
convert to python so what I'll do is

[52:06 - 52:13]
I'll just write convert above code to

[52:13 - 52:19]
python so whatever was in the above code

[52:17 - 52:22]
it would convert it to python so it was

[52:19 - 52:25]
definition of X and

[52:22 - 52:27]
Y and then it goes onto the variables

[52:25 - 52:30]
here that are in the men method and

[52:27 - 52:33]
it'll go on and on and print everything

[52:30 - 52:35]
that is a part of this code within here

[52:33 - 52:38]
now as you can see wherever it stops

[52:35 - 52:40]
here it's not stopping here that is

[52:38 - 52:42]
because we have not stopped generating

[52:40 - 52:44]
till now here since we had stopped

[52:42 - 52:47]
generating it stopped the generation of

[52:44 - 52:49]
code but the prompt that is there

[52:47 - 52:52]
previously that is where the information

[52:49 - 52:56]
is taken from so the above code which is

[52:52 - 52:58]
in C++ for the worst case scenario for

[52:56 - 53:01]
the UTA method would actually be

[52:58 - 53:04]
implemented completely in Python so this

[53:01 - 53:06]
is the worst case scenario code but it's

[53:04 - 53:09]
implementation is in Python instead of

[53:06 - 53:13]
C++ so this is how we can actually use

[53:09 - 53:16]
chat GPT for coding next let's go into a

[53:13 - 53:18]
little bit of a lighter topic about

[53:16 - 53:20]
suggestions so chat GPT gives us various

[53:18 - 53:22]
suggestions you can have suggestions for

[53:20 - 53:24]
Holiday places you can have suggestions

[53:22 - 53:27]
for cheap holiday places you can have

[53:24 - 53:28]
suggestions for game games for broke

[53:27 - 53:30]
people you could have all of these types

[53:28 - 53:33]
of suggestions so let's look at the

[53:30 - 53:36]
first suggestion here suggestions for

[53:33 - 53:38]
party games for birthday parties for 7

[53:36 - 53:41]
to 10 year olds now if I just print this

[53:38 - 53:44]
maybe it might not give me the answer

[53:41 - 53:46]
that I want so the keyword here would be

[53:44 - 53:50]
suggestions for party games for birthday

[53:46 - 53:52]
parties for 7 to 10 year olds now here

[53:50 - 53:54]
these are some of the party games that

[53:52 - 53:56]
would be suitable for 7 to 10 year olds

[53:54 - 54:00]
as per the information that Chad GP P

[53:56 - 54:02]
has obviously if you do not feel that

[54:00 - 54:05]
this is not appropriate you can always

[54:02 - 54:07]
disregard the suggestion given here

[54:05 - 54:09]
however for the most part these are

[54:07 - 54:11]
appropriate suggestions as you can see

[54:09 - 54:14]
so musical chairs spin the tail on the

[54:11 - 54:16]
donkey balloon pop scavenger hunt freeze

[54:14 - 54:18]
dancing Simon says all of these are

[54:16 - 54:21]
pretty normal games that are a part of a

[54:18 - 54:22]
7 to 10 year- old's birthday party but

[54:21 - 54:26]
these suggestions would not be

[54:22 - 54:29]
appropriate if it is a 22 to 25y old

[54:26 - 54:30]
birthday party so if we try to look at

[54:29 - 54:34]
what a birthday party should look like

[54:30 - 54:36]
for someone who is say for example 25

[54:34 - 54:39]
years old the suggestions would be very

[54:36 - 54:42]
different so as you can see the first

[54:39 - 54:44]
suggestion itself is extremely different

[54:42 - 54:47]
again these are just suggestions you are

[54:44 - 54:51]
always free to include other games or

[54:47 - 54:53]
exclude multiple games here but these

[54:51 - 54:56]
are the suggestions that chat GPD

[54:53 - 54:59]
provides us with right now let's look at

[54:56 - 55:02]
something a little bit more complex what

[54:59 - 55:05]
about if I want a suggestion for party

[55:02 - 55:08]
games for college reunions now if I want

[55:05 - 55:08]
suggestions for

[55:09 - 55:13]
these then here the suggestions would be

[55:11 - 55:16]
slightly different a lot of these would

[55:13 - 55:19]
be related to the college or related to

[55:16 - 55:21]
things that I have done in college

[55:19 - 55:23]
something that could actually help all

[55:21 - 55:26]
of the various people who

[55:23 - 55:28]
have gathered there to rebond with with

[55:26 - 55:31]
each other again here this is a pretty

[55:28 - 55:33]
straightforward suggestion what if this

[55:31 - 55:37]
particular suggestion was a little bit

[55:33 - 55:40]
more complex so for example if we are

[55:37 - 55:42]
suggesting games for college reunions

[55:40 - 55:44]
but they have

[55:42 - 55:47]
children with

[55:44 - 55:50]
them so here you can see the things that

[55:47 - 55:53]
we're doing here are slightly different

[55:50 - 55:56]
the only thing is that now it would be

[55:53 - 55:58]
kid-friendly also so here as you can see

[55:56 - 56:01]
for the exact same suggestion of party

[55:58 - 56:03]
games for College reunion the list of

[56:01 - 56:05]
things that you can do with kids and

[56:03 - 56:07]
without kids are different as a result

[56:05 - 56:09]
you can see that the suggestion also

[56:07 - 56:12]
changes now if you want to further

[56:09 - 56:14]
filter out or further increase the kind

[56:12 - 56:16]
of keywords that are a part of the

[56:14 - 56:18]
prompts here you can obviously do that

[56:16 - 56:21]
you could also have prompts wherein you

[56:18 - 56:24]
are U looking for suggestions of party

[56:21 - 56:27]
games with college reunions uh at a very

[56:24 - 56:30]
good hotel or we could also have a

[56:27 - 56:33]
suggestion for college games

[56:30 - 56:35]
in an uptown hotel or suggestions for

[56:33 - 56:38]
the hotel itself so here what we're

[56:35 - 56:40]
doing is just having a little bit of fun

[56:38 - 56:42]
with all of the various keywords that we

[56:40 - 56:45]
use so all of these types of suggestions

[56:42 - 56:46]
can actually be implemented here and

[56:45 - 56:49]
it's up to you whether you want to take

[56:46 - 56:51]
in these suggestions or not but Chad GPT

[56:49 - 56:54]
would give you a list of things that you

[56:51 - 56:57]
can do to the best of its abilities next

[56:54 - 56:59]
let's look at how CH GP can help us with

[56:57 - 57:02]
summarization now as we know

[56:59 - 57:04]
summarization is the task where we

[57:02 - 57:08]
actually uh take up all of the important

[57:04 - 57:10]
bits of a particular large text and we

[57:08 - 57:13]
quickly summarize and squeeze it into a

[57:10 - 57:15]
few statements now this summarization is

[57:13 - 57:17]
very important especially if you're

[57:15 - 57:20]
trying to read through or if you're

[57:17 - 57:22]
trying to understand multiple research

[57:20 - 57:24]
papers while writing a research paper of

[57:22 - 57:27]
your own or while trying to research on

[57:24 - 57:30]
a given topic so many of times during

[57:27 - 57:32]
research summarization becomes extremely

[57:30 - 57:35]
tedious even though it's tedious it is

[57:32 - 57:37]
still an important task during research

[57:35 - 57:39]
so what can we do and how can Chad GPT

[57:37 - 57:41]
help us in

[57:39 - 57:44]
summarization suppose we have this kind

[57:41 - 57:46]
of a Blog wherein we have some

[57:44 - 57:48]
technology that we are interested in and

[57:46 - 57:51]
this Blog has information about that

[57:48 - 57:54]
technology now as a researcher I've got

[57:51 - 57:57]
say 15 to 20 blogs that I need to review

[57:54 - 57:59]
in the next 30 minutes only there is not

[57:57 - 58:01]
enough time for me to read through even

[57:59 - 58:05]
one blog and understand what the topics

[58:01 - 58:08]
are so what I can do is very simple copy

[58:05 - 58:11]
the whole blog here now since this blog

[58:08 - 58:13]
is a part of the AWS blogs I can

[58:11 - 58:16]
actually use this here since these are

[58:13 - 58:18]
freely available so I've copied this

[58:16 - 58:21]
particular blog and what I'm going to do

[58:18 - 58:24]
is I'm going to go into my chat GPD and

[58:21 - 58:28]
simply say

[58:24 - 58:28]
summarize the following

[58:30 - 58:36]
and paste the text here so literally the

[58:34 - 58:39]
whole text that was a part of the blog

[58:36 - 58:40]
has been pasted here with a suggestion

[58:39 - 58:45]
to summarize

[58:40 - 58:49]
it let's see what happens Chad GPT very

[58:45 - 58:51]
helpfully starts summarizing the whole

[58:49 - 58:55]
text that we have pasted here now this

[58:51 - 59:00]
text has a minimum of 1,000 words given

[58:55 - 59:05]
in it it and here chat GPT summarizes it

[59:00 - 59:07]
into say for example 100 or 120 words

[59:05 - 59:10]
only so it's easier for me to read

[59:07 - 59:13]
through this and understand the gist of

[59:10 - 59:15]
it rather than actually going through

[59:13 - 59:18]
all of the content now as you can see

[59:15 - 59:21]
this is not as short as I want so what I

[59:18 - 59:23]
can do is

[59:21 - 59:28]
further

[59:23 - 59:28]
summarize the above paragraph

[59:31 - 59:35]
and it will further summarize and

[59:33 - 59:38]
further reduce the amount of information

[59:35 - 59:42]
that is a part of the paragraph Above So

[59:38 - 59:44]
now I've got a say five to six

[59:42 - 59:46]
sentence paragraph which is easier to

[59:44 - 59:49]
learn easier to understand easier to

[59:46 - 59:51]
remember and whatever takeaway is there

[59:49 - 59:55]
is now in a much more concise manner

[59:51 - 59:57]
than before so Chad GPT helps us

[59:55 - 59:59]
summarize a a lot of the content and

[59:57 - 01:00:01]
this can be done for various kinds of

[59:59 - 01:00:03]
things like if you've got a complete

[01:00:01 - 01:00:06]
chapter you need to study and you want

[01:00:03 - 01:00:08]
the summarization of that or if you want

[01:00:06 - 01:00:11]
to have a complete abstract of whatever

[01:00:08 - 01:00:12]
research you've already done now please

[01:00:11 - 01:00:14]
remember if it is a research that you're

[01:00:12 - 01:00:17]
doing and an abstract that you're

[01:00:14 - 01:00:19]
writing for it because yes we can write

[01:00:17 - 01:00:22]
abstracts too one thing you need to

[01:00:19 - 01:00:24]
remember is not to completely copy and

[01:00:22 - 01:00:26]
paste chat GPT because as I've said

[01:00:24 - 01:00:27]
earlier there are copy right

[01:00:26 - 01:00:30]
infringement connotations as well as

[01:00:27 - 01:00:33]
plagiarisms involved here so please make

[01:00:30 - 01:00:35]
sure that you are actually paraphrasing

[01:00:33 - 01:00:38]
anything and everything that you use

[01:00:35 - 01:00:40]
from chart GPT chart GPT can be used for

[01:00:38 - 01:00:43]
suggestions but they should not be used

[01:00:40 - 01:00:46]
as it is to complete tasks that are

[01:00:43 - 01:00:48]
required from you in your coursework now

[01:00:46 - 01:00:50]
let's look at another way in which we

[01:00:48 - 01:00:53]
can use chart GPT for summarization

[01:00:50 - 01:00:57]
suppose in my research I want to point

[01:00:53 - 01:01:00]
out that isa. is something that I am not

[01:00:57 - 01:01:03]
going to use for a particular set of

[01:01:00 - 01:01:06]
reasons now how do I actually summarize

[01:01:03 - 01:01:09]
this here in a negative voice so it's

[01:01:06 - 01:01:12]
very simple what I'll do is go back to

[01:01:09 - 01:01:15]
my paragraph or go back to the source of

[01:01:12 - 01:01:19]
the blog copy this blog again and paste

[01:01:15 - 01:01:19]
the blog here

[01:01:24 - 01:01:30]
however as you can see see my prompt has

[01:01:27 - 01:01:33]
changed not only am I summarizing it I

[01:01:30 - 01:01:35]
am summarizing it in a negative voice

[01:01:33 - 01:01:39]
this means that I'm trying to pinpoint

[01:01:35 - 01:01:41]
all of the limitations of using isima IO

[01:01:39 - 01:01:43]
now the reason for that is because it is

[01:01:41 - 01:01:47]
a necessity in whatever research I am

[01:01:43 - 01:01:49]
doing I need some kind of negative

[01:01:47 - 01:01:52]
feedback showing a reason why I would

[01:01:49 - 01:01:54]
not be using this particular entity or

[01:01:52 - 01:01:58]
for whatever reason I wouldn't require a

[01:01:54 - 01:01:58]
negative feedback so so as you can

[01:02:00 - 01:02:06]
see the summary given before and the

[01:02:03 - 01:02:08]
summary given later would have

[01:02:06 - 01:02:11]
differences in

[01:02:08 - 01:02:13]
it further

[01:02:11 - 01:02:17]
summarize

[01:02:13 - 01:02:17]
with negative

[01:02:19 - 01:02:27]
voice and I've not written what it needs

[01:02:22 - 01:02:29]
to summarize so that is why

[01:02:27 - 01:02:33]
chat GPT would give me this particular

[01:02:29 - 01:02:35]
answer one is the summarization here

[01:02:33 - 01:02:37]
with negative voice is something that it

[01:02:35 - 01:02:40]
does not want to fulfill

[01:02:37 - 01:02:43]
because it strives to provide neutral

[01:02:40 - 01:02:46]
and objective summaries without coloring

[01:02:43 - 01:02:49]
the views of anyone right without any

[01:02:46 - 01:02:50]
bias or without any judgments so here

[01:02:49 - 01:02:53]
this is an important thing to remember

[01:02:50 - 01:02:56]
that chat GPT is different from instruct

[01:02:53 - 01:02:59]
GPT which was a predecessor of it

[01:02:56 - 01:03:01]
here chat GPT actually tries to give as

[01:02:59 - 01:03:03]
much as positive or neutral feedback as

[01:03:01 - 01:03:05]
possible so even if you ask it to

[01:03:03 - 01:03:08]
summarize it further in the negative

[01:03:05 - 01:03:10]
voice it might give you answers like

[01:03:08 - 01:03:13]
these so this is how summarization can

[01:03:10 - 01:03:16]
be done using chart GPT next let us look

[01:03:13 - 01:03:19]
into keyword based content generation so

[01:03:16 - 01:03:22]
if we give some keywords can chart GPT

[01:03:19 - 01:03:24]
create content based upon the keywords

[01:03:22 - 01:03:26]
so let's say we've got some stories that

[01:03:24 - 01:03:28]
we want to create

[01:03:26 - 01:03:31]
and let's say that the keywords that the

[01:03:28 - 01:03:35]
stories have to be based upon is a house

[01:03:31 - 01:03:36]
cats maybe and some rain and let's say

[01:03:35 - 01:03:39]
one more

[01:03:36 - 01:03:40]
catnip right so these are the keywords

[01:03:39 - 01:03:42]
based upon which I want the story to be

[01:03:40 - 01:03:45]
generated so as you can see because of

[01:03:42 - 01:03:48]
the prompt given which is a story about

[01:03:45 - 01:03:50]
house cat rain and catnip there is a

[01:03:48 - 01:03:53]
complete story that is being written by

[01:03:50 - 01:03:54]
Chad GPT that contains a house with a

[01:03:53 - 01:03:56]
lovely Garden in the front and a

[01:03:54 - 01:03:58]
spacious backyard

[01:03:56 - 01:04:02]
uh it's got a cat called whiskers and

[01:03:58 - 01:04:04]
whiskers gets a gift of fresh batch of

[01:04:02 - 01:04:06]
catnips so literally all of the keywords

[01:04:04 - 01:04:09]
that we've given as a part of a prompt

[01:04:06 - 01:04:11]
are all being used here as a part of the

[01:04:09 - 01:04:14]
story however as you can see the story

[01:04:11 - 01:04:17]
goes on and on and on and it is not

[01:04:14 - 01:04:19]
something that I would like to you know

[01:04:17 - 01:04:21]
display or demonstrate here so the story

[01:04:19 - 01:04:23]
is here if you want you can create a

[01:04:21 - 01:04:25]
longer story this is a short story

[01:04:23 - 01:04:28]
generated so this is something we can do

[01:04:25 - 01:04:31]
here now let's see if the same prompt

[01:04:28 - 01:04:31]
can work with

[01:04:33 - 01:04:38]
poetry so if we've got a poetry

[01:04:35 - 01:04:41]
generated using house cat rain and

[01:04:38 - 01:04:44]
catnip so as you can see a poetry can

[01:04:41 - 01:04:47]
also be generated right so in a similar

[01:04:44 - 01:04:49]
manner using keywords we could generate

[01:04:47 - 01:04:51]
all of these things let's see if we can

[01:04:49 - 01:04:57]
generate an add script in the same

[01:04:51 - 01:04:57]
manner and advertising script add

[01:04:59 - 01:05:02]
script

[01:05:02 - 01:05:08]
using all of these features like

[01:05:09 - 01:05:15]
cat

[01:05:11 - 01:05:20]
house rain and

[01:05:15 - 01:05:20]
catnip let us generate a response

[01:05:22 - 01:05:27]
here so yes as you can see even an

[01:05:25 - 01:05:30]
advertising script can be generated so

[01:05:27 - 01:05:32]
there's a voice over there are cut tools

[01:05:30 - 01:05:34]
like everything that you would require

[01:05:32 - 01:05:37]
in an advertising script can actually be

[01:05:34 - 01:05:40]
demonstrated here using the keywords and

[01:05:37 - 01:05:42]
as you can see there is a cat obviously

[01:05:40 - 01:05:45]
there is a cozy house with a lovely

[01:05:42 - 01:05:48]
Garden there is rain sounds and raindrop

[01:05:45 - 01:05:49]
can be heard tapping and all of these so

[01:05:48 - 01:05:52]
literally all the keywords that you have

[01:05:49 - 01:05:54]
given here which is cat house rain and

[01:05:52 - 01:05:56]
catnip will be inculcated into the

[01:05:54 - 01:06:00]
script here and and the advertisement

[01:05:56 - 01:06:03]
can be completely created as it is right

[01:06:00 - 01:06:05]
so this is how we can actually create

[01:06:03 - 01:06:08]
content or create scripts using the

[01:06:05 - 01:06:10]
keywords that we want not only can we

[01:06:08 - 01:06:13]
create scripts using keywords we can

[01:06:10 - 01:06:15]
also create uh stories we can also

[01:06:13 - 01:06:18]
create poetries we can literally create

[01:06:15 - 01:06:20]
any kind of content using the specific

[01:06:18 - 01:06:24]
keywords that we require to be included

[01:06:20 - 01:06:26]
or inculcated into our content so now we

[01:06:24 - 01:06:28]
looked at how

[01:06:26 - 01:06:31]
chat GPT can create content based upon

[01:06:28 - 01:06:33]
keywords now let's look at whether chat

[01:06:31 - 01:06:36]
GPT can create keywords based upon the

[01:06:33 - 01:06:39]
topics that we give to it so suppose we

[01:06:36 - 01:06:40]
want to create a Google ad but we're not

[01:06:39 - 01:06:44]
understanding exactly what keywords to

[01:06:40 - 01:06:46]
use within those Google ads so let's say

[01:06:44 - 01:06:48]
this is the prompt generate a list of

[01:06:46 - 01:06:50]
keywords for Google ads for fashion

[01:06:48 - 01:06:52]
brand and again as you can see there is

[01:06:50 - 01:06:54]
a typo here let me correct that typo now

[01:06:52 - 01:06:57]
because we have another typo which is

[01:06:54 - 01:06:59]
ADS okay okay so this is our prompt

[01:06:57 - 01:07:02]
keywords for Google ads for fashion

[01:06:59 - 01:07:04]
brand let's see what type of keywords it

[01:07:02 - 01:07:06]
can generate so as you can see here are

[01:07:04 - 01:07:08]
some of the possible keywords for Google

[01:07:06 - 01:07:11]
ads for a fashion brand now it's not

[01:07:08 - 01:07:13]
necessary that it would be a woman's

[01:07:11 - 01:07:16]
fashion brand or a man's fashion brand

[01:07:13 - 01:07:18]
or a kids fashion brand it's just a set

[01:07:16 - 01:07:20]
of keywords which can be used for

[01:07:18 - 01:07:22]
fashion brand and a disclaimer is also

[01:07:20 - 01:07:25]
put in here by chat GPT that the choice

[01:07:22 - 01:07:26]
of keywords may vary depending upon the

[01:07:25 - 01:07:28]
target target audience the product that

[01:07:26 - 01:07:30]
are being offered and the goals for

[01:07:28 - 01:07:34]
marketing that have been set so please

[01:07:30 - 01:07:36]
do your research right now what if we

[01:07:34 - 01:07:39]
want to bucket these now what is

[01:07:36 - 01:07:42]
bucketing bucketing is where we actually

[01:07:39 - 01:07:45]
Club all of these keywords together in

[01:07:42 - 01:07:48]
order to understand exactly where or how

[01:07:45 - 01:07:50]
these keywords can be used so let's

[01:07:48 - 01:07:53]
write a prompt here which is more of a

[01:07:50 - 01:07:55]
follow-up prompt bucket the categories

[01:07:53 - 01:07:57]
or bucket the keywords under different

[01:07:55 - 01:08:00]
categories as per their intent so

[01:07:57 - 01:08:02]
obviously chat gbt knows that it has

[01:08:00 - 01:08:05]
bucketed or it has created all of these

[01:08:02 - 01:08:07]
above categories and it needs to bucket

[01:08:05 - 01:08:08]
these categories based on those so as

[01:08:07 - 01:08:10]
you can see there are categories like

[01:08:08 - 01:08:12]
informational and research intent there

[01:08:10 - 01:08:14]
is navigational intent there is

[01:08:12 - 01:08:17]
transactional intent so all of these

[01:08:14 - 01:08:20]
intent based categorizations are done

[01:08:17 - 01:08:23]
here again these categorizations are

[01:08:20 - 01:08:25]
called out to be subjectives and these

[01:08:23 - 01:08:28]
may vary so we need to be very careful

[01:08:25 - 01:08:31]
here right now let us see if using these

[01:08:28 - 01:08:34]
buckets we can write an ad so let's say

[01:08:31 - 01:08:38]
we want to create a script for an ad

[01:08:34 - 01:08:40]
using the informational bucket right so

[01:08:38 - 01:08:40]
how would the ad

[01:08:45 - 01:08:50]
look so see discover the hottest fashion

[01:08:51 - 01:08:56]
looks fashion

[01:08:53 - 01:08:58]
photography so can you you see here

[01:08:56 - 01:09:00]
we've got fashion trends we've got

[01:08:58 - 01:09:02]
fashion photography we've got runway

[01:09:00 - 01:09:04]
fashion fashion styling fashion tips so

[01:09:02 - 01:09:05]
literally all of those the fashion

[01:09:04 - 01:09:07]
trends that are there the fashion

[01:09:05 - 01:09:11]
photography that is there fashion

[01:09:07 - 01:09:12]
experts fashion looks all of these

[01:09:11 - 01:09:14]
topics would actually be here and the

[01:09:12 - 01:09:17]
call to action on the Google ad would be

[01:09:14 - 01:09:19]
visit our website now so this is what we

[01:09:17 - 01:09:21]
want you to do as a fashion brand we

[01:09:19 - 01:09:23]
want you to visit the website where

[01:09:21 - 01:09:25]
these fashion brands are there so all of

[01:09:23 - 01:09:27]
these would actually be a part of our

[01:09:25 - 01:09:29]
Google ad again there is a disclaimer

[01:09:27 - 01:09:31]
that it is designed to attract users who

[01:09:29 - 01:09:33]
are interested in learning about the

[01:09:31 - 01:09:35]
latest fashion trends so those who are

[01:09:33 - 01:09:37]
interested in the informational intent

[01:09:35 - 01:09:40]
would come up here so as you can see

[01:09:37 - 01:09:41]
based upon the informational bucket and

[01:09:40 - 01:09:44]
the keywords in the informational bucket

[01:09:41 - 01:09:46]
we've got this particular ad created in

[01:09:44 - 01:09:48]
a similar manner we can also use the

[01:09:46 - 01:09:50]
transactional intent wherein we are

[01:09:48 - 01:09:52]
actually calling people to shop here to

[01:09:50 - 01:09:54]
do transactions here and we can also

[01:09:52 - 01:09:56]
have the navigational intent where we

[01:09:54 - 01:09:57]
are asking people to come in and to

[01:09:56 - 01:09:59]
explore our brand and to explore our

[01:09:57 - 01:10:02]
fashion boutique in this particular

[01:09:59 - 01:10:04]
manner based upon the keywords we can

[01:10:02 - 01:10:06]
bucket them we can also generate ads

[01:10:04 - 01:10:09]
specific to these keywords and we can

[01:10:06 - 01:10:11]
continue to paraphrase these ads to be

[01:10:09 - 01:10:16]
more relatable to the users right or we

[01:10:11 - 01:10:18]
can Target them to say ladies men kids

[01:10:16 - 01:10:22]
young adults teenagers based upon

[01:10:18 - 01:10:24]
whatever our target audience is we can

[01:10:22 - 01:10:26]
actually Target our ads or we can filter

[01:10:24 - 01:10:28]
our ads by giving the appropriate

[01:10:26 - 01:10:31]
keywords there now let's just talk about

[01:10:28 - 01:10:34]
gbt 4 what it is right so as the name

[01:10:31 - 01:10:37]
suggest first we let's disect the word

[01:10:34 - 01:10:40]
called GPT right what does it mean it

[01:10:37 - 01:10:42]
means generative pre-trained Transformer

[01:10:40 - 01:10:45]
right

[01:10:42 - 01:10:47]
we'll understand each and every word in

[01:10:45 - 01:10:50]
a greater depth in the next slide but

[01:10:47 - 01:10:52]
what gbt is in a nutshell now GPT is the

[01:10:50 - 01:10:54]
type of artificial intelligence that can

[01:10:52 - 01:10:58]
generate text now the key word here is

[01:10:54 - 01:11:01]
generating text it's a text based model

[01:10:58 - 01:11:04]
it does this by being trained on massive

[01:11:01 - 01:11:07]
amounts of Text data right so we talked

[01:11:04 - 01:11:08]
about the data that comes in right the

[01:11:07 - 01:11:10]
the amounts of data that is being

[01:11:08 - 01:11:13]
generated in the world in on day-to-day

[01:11:10 - 01:11:15]
basis so now it is being trained on that

[01:11:13 - 01:11:17]
data the algorithm is being trained on

[01:11:15 - 01:11:20]
that data the model is being trained on

[01:11:17 - 01:11:23]
that data now once it is trained it is

[01:11:20 - 01:11:25]
used to generate new text by simply

[01:11:23 - 01:11:30]
starting with a prompt right right so

[01:11:25 - 01:11:32]
this GPT is then integrated as a chatbot

[01:11:30 - 01:11:37]
so what exactly happens is GPD

[01:11:32 - 01:11:39]
understands the computer language right

[01:11:37 - 01:11:41]
it does not understand human language

[01:11:39 - 01:11:43]
but when you attach it with the chatbot

[01:11:41 - 01:11:47]
that is integrated in

[01:11:43 - 01:11:50]
GPT then it becomes a model in which we

[01:11:47 - 01:11:52]
as humans can interact with computers in

[01:11:50 - 01:11:53]
the language that we want we I don't

[01:11:52 - 01:11:55]
need to learn C programming I don't need

[01:11:53 - 01:11:59]
to Learn Python I can can still interact

[01:11:55 - 01:12:01]
with computers this is exactly what the

[01:11:59 - 01:12:04]
landscape has changed with GPT

[01:12:01 - 01:12:06]
models right so once it's stain it can

[01:12:04 - 01:12:08]
be used to generate new text by simply

[01:12:06 - 01:12:10]
starting a prompt and letting the model

[01:12:08 - 01:12:13]
predict what is the next word that is

[01:12:10 - 01:12:14]
going to come right so here are some

[01:12:13 - 01:12:18]
examples of what gbt can do it can

[01:12:14 - 01:12:20]
generate poems it can code write scripts

[01:12:18 - 01:12:23]
right musical

[01:12:20 - 01:12:25]
pieces emails letters and so on right it

[01:12:23 - 01:12:28]
can generate a lot of information

[01:12:25 - 01:12:29]
and how does it know all these things

[01:12:28 - 01:12:32]
because it has been trained in that

[01:12:29 - 01:12:35]
manner with large amounts of poems to

[01:12:32 - 01:12:37]
know how it works large amount of code

[01:12:35 - 01:12:39]
what other the so it knows by the way

[01:12:37 - 01:12:41]
all programming languages possible it

[01:12:39 - 01:12:44]
can translate text from one language to

[01:12:41 - 01:12:46]
the other if I write something in

[01:12:44 - 01:12:48]
English and I want something to come up

[01:12:46 - 01:12:51]
in German it will give the same how you

[01:12:48 - 01:12:53]
speak right German it'll give in it'll

[01:12:51 - 01:12:56]
give it in English but it will give the

[01:12:53 - 01:12:59]
what is how it is pronounced in

[01:12:56 - 01:13:02]
Germany so it can answer questions about

[01:12:59 - 01:13:05]
a variety of topics it can summarize

[01:13:02 - 01:13:07]
texts right you have given let's say a a

[01:13:05 - 01:13:09]
debate topic right an essay you have

[01:13:07 - 01:13:11]
written you want to rephrase it you need

[01:13:09 - 01:13:14]
to summarize what is there in that

[01:13:11 - 01:13:18]
entire flow right you want to write an

[01:13:14 - 01:13:19]
ex abstract of research paper right it

[01:13:18 - 01:13:22]
can help you in some manner I'm not

[01:13:19 - 01:13:24]
saying that it is accurate to do what

[01:13:22 - 01:13:26]
you want it to do but it is well defined

[01:13:24 - 01:13:29]
in in that manner it definitely would

[01:13:26 - 01:13:31]
not make much grammatical errors right

[01:13:29 - 01:13:34]
then let's just dissect the world GPT

[01:13:31 - 01:13:37]
what does it mean generative pre-trained

[01:13:34 - 01:13:39]
Transformer what does it mean generative

[01:13:37 - 01:13:42]
as the name suggest it can create a new

[01:13:39 - 01:13:45]
information right then we talk about

[01:13:42 - 01:13:47]
pre-trained right so initially the

[01:13:45 - 01:13:48]
models undergrow unsupervised

[01:13:47 - 01:13:51]
pre-training phase where they are

[01:13:48 - 01:13:52]
exposed to a large amount of data right

[01:13:51 - 01:13:56]
it is basically

[01:13:52 - 01:13:58]
giving the large amount of data to the

[01:13:56 - 01:14:01]
model and just telling it okay let's

[01:13:58 - 01:14:03]
start right so subsequently the they

[01:14:01 - 01:14:05]
undergo a supervise fine tuning phase in

[01:14:03 - 01:14:07]
which they all the errors that they have

[01:14:05 - 01:14:09]
created in the first iteration that goes

[01:14:07 - 01:14:10]
away in the second one right which

[01:14:09 - 01:14:13]
provides guidance to that model this

[01:14:10 - 01:14:16]
find uning process can be tailored to

[01:14:13 - 01:14:19]
specific tasks right tailor fitted right

[01:14:16 - 01:14:21]
write an email in a polite tone right

[01:14:19 - 01:14:23]
that is tailor made right so that is how

[01:14:21 - 01:14:26]
it learns the the variations in

[01:14:23 - 01:14:28]
different types of languages is the tone

[01:14:26 - 01:14:31]
the variation in different kinds of tone

[01:14:28 - 01:14:34]
that is there right so that is

[01:14:31 - 01:14:36]
pre-trained then comes Transformers

[01:14:34 - 01:14:38]
right so it is a deep learning model

[01:14:36 - 01:14:40]
which utilizes a technique called

[01:14:38 - 01:14:42]
tracking the relationship in sequential

[01:14:40 - 01:14:45]
order to learn the context of what is

[01:14:42 - 01:14:48]
being provided in the case of gpts they

[01:14:45 - 01:14:50]
observe words or tokens right so GPT has

[01:14:48 - 01:14:52]
it doesn't take word there's a ratio

[01:14:50 - 01:14:54]
between word and token but the language

[01:14:52 - 01:14:58]
it understands to the number of words

[01:14:54 - 01:15:00]
right is tokens in GPT within a sentence

[01:14:58 - 01:15:03]
and make predictions about the following

[01:15:00 - 01:15:05]
word or the token right so that is

[01:15:03 - 01:15:07]
generative pre-train Transformer now

[01:15:05 - 01:15:11]
let's just see what are the various

[01:15:07 - 01:15:14]
steps that are involved in in this GPT

[01:15:11 - 01:15:17]
right no one by the way everybody talks

[01:15:14 - 01:15:19]
about how to use GPT this is the reason

[01:15:17 - 01:15:21]
the reason why I'm telling you this in

[01:15:19 - 01:15:23]
detail is that you should know how what

[01:15:21 - 01:15:26]
is the thing that is working behind the

[01:15:23 - 01:15:29]
scenes right you you repeat you can just

[01:15:26 - 01:15:31]
write everything in chart GPT or GPT 4

[01:15:29 - 01:15:34]
and it will give you some responses but

[01:15:31 - 01:15:37]
what is the thinking behind it what how

[01:15:34 - 01:15:39]
does the model work why is that it did

[01:15:37 - 01:15:41]
not come up so many years ago right what

[01:15:39 - 01:15:44]
was the thing that it was being trained

[01:15:41 - 01:15:46]
on that is a data right so let's just

[01:15:44 - 01:15:49]
understand the steps that are involved

[01:15:46 - 01:15:50]
right in GPT in understanding how this

[01:15:49 - 01:15:54]
is made

[01:15:50 - 01:15:57]
right what does the first set mean right

[01:15:54 - 01:15:59]
what does the first First Step involves

[01:15:57 - 01:16:01]
that is the training the GPT now GPT is

[01:15:59 - 01:16:02]
trained under a process called

[01:16:01 - 01:16:05]
generative

[01:16:02 - 01:16:07]
pre-training now in generative

[01:16:05 - 01:16:10]
pre-training the model is given large

[01:16:07 - 01:16:12]
cops of text and is asked to predict the

[01:16:10 - 01:16:16]
next word in the sequence right for

[01:16:12 - 01:16:18]
example Ram is playing Dash right now it

[01:16:16 - 01:16:21]
can predict what it is playing

[01:16:18 - 01:16:23]
volleyball playing tennis playing chess

[01:16:21 - 01:16:25]
a lot of things now this process is

[01:16:23 - 01:16:27]
repeated a lot of times time so that the

[01:16:25 - 01:16:30]
model learns to predict what the next

[01:16:27 - 01:16:34]
word is with the increasing

[01:16:30 - 01:16:36]
accuracy the second step is as you can

[01:16:34 - 01:16:39]
see is splitting the data set now this

[01:16:36 - 01:16:41]
data set is split into two parts number

[01:16:39 - 01:16:43]
one is the training set number two is a

[01:16:41 - 01:16:46]
test set now the training set is used to

[01:16:43 - 01:16:50]
train the GPD model and the test set is

[01:16:46 - 01:16:52]
used to evaluate that GPT model the test

[01:16:50 - 01:16:55]
set is not used to train the model so it

[01:16:52 - 01:16:58]
can be used to measure the model

[01:16:55 - 01:17:03]
accuracy on the Unseen data that is

[01:16:58 - 01:17:05]
there the third step right the third

[01:17:03 - 01:17:08]
step is training the GPT model using

[01:17:05 - 01:17:10]
supervised learning methods now the GPT

[01:17:08 - 01:17:11]
model is trained by super supervised

[01:17:10 - 01:17:15]
learning so what happens in in

[01:17:11 - 01:17:17]
supervised learning the model is given a

[01:17:15 - 01:17:20]
set of input data and a set of output

[01:17:17 - 01:17:23]
data now the model learns to map the

[01:17:20 - 01:17:26]
input data to the output data so in case

[01:17:23 - 01:17:29]
of GPT the input data is a sequence of

[01:17:26 - 01:17:31]
words and the output data is the next

[01:17:29 - 01:17:34]
word in the sequence this is how it

[01:17:31 - 01:17:38]
learns then we have evaluating the GPT

[01:17:34 - 01:17:41]
model right the model is evaluated on a

[01:17:38 - 01:17:43]
test set the accuracy of the model is is

[01:17:41 - 01:17:46]
measured by the percentage of times the

[01:17:43 - 01:17:49]
model predicts the correct word right so

[01:17:46 - 01:17:52]
this is how it it understands what is

[01:17:49 - 01:17:55]
happening then fine-tuning happens of of

[01:17:52 - 01:17:57]
GPT models it can be fine tuned for a

[01:17:55 - 01:17:59]
specific task fine tuning is a process

[01:17:57 - 01:18:02]
of adjusting the model parameters to

[01:17:59 - 01:18:04]
improve the performance of that task Now

[01:18:02 - 01:18:05]
using charge abity you can generate text

[01:18:04 - 01:18:07]
translate the languages answer various

[01:18:05 - 01:18:09]
questions that are there you know build

[01:18:07 - 01:18:11]
it across your businesses integrate in

[01:18:09 - 01:18:12]
your businesses there are a lot of

[01:18:11 - 01:18:15]
Chrome extensions now you can integrate

[01:18:12 - 01:18:17]
it into your businesses so that you

[01:18:15 - 01:18:19]
would have like an AI assistant to you

[01:18:17 - 01:18:22]
right so all these the other steps that

[01:18:19 - 01:18:25]
are involved so the next one is again

[01:18:22 - 01:18:28]
what we talked about GPT is trained on a

[01:18:25 - 01:18:30]
massive set of data text or code right

[01:18:28 - 01:18:32]
then the data set is split into the

[01:18:30 - 01:18:34]
training set and the test set the

[01:18:32 - 01:18:36]
training set is used to train the GPT

[01:18:34 - 01:18:39]
model the test set is used to evaluate

[01:18:36 - 01:18:41]
the GPT model then the GPT model is

[01:18:39 - 01:18:43]
fine-tuned again as we mentioned on a

[01:18:41 - 01:18:45]
specific task then the model is ready to

[01:18:43 - 01:18:48]
use now this seems to be a very simple

[01:18:45 - 01:18:51]
process but trust me on that it has

[01:18:48 - 01:18:53]
taken lot of time lot of effort from all

[01:18:51 - 01:18:55]
the engineers all the scientists to

[01:18:53 - 01:18:58]
develop this algorithm to develop that

[01:18:55 - 01:19:00]
complex Max integrate in in with the

[01:18:58 - 01:19:04]
computers so that we get the models that

[01:19:00 - 01:19:06]
we have today right so what is gp4 if

[01:19:04 - 01:19:08]
you talk about so it is the latest

[01:19:06 - 01:19:10]
iteration of the language model it has

[01:19:08 - 01:19:12]
been designed with the focus of

[01:19:10 - 01:19:14]
enhancing the alignment with the user

[01:19:12 - 01:19:17]
intentions now gb4 is made by the

[01:19:14 - 01:19:20]
company called open AI so that is the

[01:19:17 - 01:19:23]
parent company that makes these models J

[01:19:20 - 01:19:25]
gbt or gbt 4 now it aims to improve the

[01:19:23 - 01:19:27]
accuracy of the outputs right right it

[01:19:25 - 01:19:29]
has a higher order thinking it has a

[01:19:27 - 01:19:31]
cognitive thinking it has a logical

[01:19:29 - 01:19:35]
reasoning better high quality logical

[01:19:31 - 01:19:37]
reasoning right so compared to its

[01:19:35 - 01:19:39]
predecessor it demonstrate better

[01:19:37 - 01:19:40]
performance in the factual correctness

[01:19:39 - 01:19:44]
of the things that are there and the

[01:19:40 - 01:19:46]
error rates are low it also introduce

[01:19:44 - 01:19:49]
advancements in the steerability right

[01:19:46 - 01:19:52]
the enabling the users to customize the

[01:19:49 - 01:19:54]
model's tone the tonality and also the

[01:19:52 - 01:19:55]
style according to the requirement that

[01:19:54 - 01:19:57]
is there

[01:19:55 - 01:19:59]
right gb4 aders most strictly to the

[01:19:57 - 01:20:01]
guidelines that are there refusing to

[01:19:59 - 01:20:04]
fulfill any inappropriate request that

[01:20:01 - 01:20:06]
comes up right now what are the

[01:20:04 - 01:20:08]
capabilities of gp4 if you ask me it's

[01:20:06 - 01:20:10]
unlike its predecessors it has the

[01:20:08 - 01:20:13]
ability to both analyze image and text

[01:20:10 - 01:20:15]
okay this is very important in gbt 4

[01:20:13 - 01:20:17]
model you can integrate images and it

[01:20:15 - 01:20:20]
will give you a text output the output

[01:20:17 - 01:20:21]
will always remain text but you you can

[01:20:20 - 01:20:25]
input images which was not the case in

[01:20:21 - 01:20:26]
chat gbt right enhancing is capab to

[01:20:25 - 01:20:29]
connect the image content with the

[01:20:26 - 01:20:31]
written questions now gbd4 exhibits

[01:20:29 - 01:20:34]
Superior performance in variety of tasks

[01:20:31 - 01:20:36]
that involves creativity and again

[01:20:34 - 01:20:39]
Advanced reasoning compared to the

[01:20:36 - 01:20:43]
charity now with the capacity to process

[01:20:39 - 01:20:45]
the entire scientific papers in one go

[01:20:43 - 01:20:47]
and tackle the complex questions and

[01:20:45 - 01:20:49]
establish the connections right it is

[01:20:47 - 01:20:51]
good in establishing connections so if

[01:20:49 - 01:20:53]
you have a thread running in of

[01:20:51 - 01:20:56]
questions of prompts it has better

[01:20:53 - 01:20:57]
ability to Analyze That Right understand

[01:20:56 - 01:21:00]
the way you are

[01:20:57 - 01:21:02]
thinking right again the data we are

[01:21:00 - 01:21:04]
feeding and they're learning towards it

[01:21:02 - 01:21:07]
the prompts right from that questions

[01:21:04 - 01:21:08]
they're learning right now gp4 employs a

[01:21:07 - 01:21:10]
token based measurement this is what I

[01:21:08 - 01:21:12]
mentioned to you that it it does not

[01:21:10 - 01:21:15]
really understand words it understands a

[01:21:12 - 01:21:18]
thing called tokens on an average 75

[01:21:15 - 01:21:20]
words occupy 100 tokens so that's the

[01:21:18 - 01:21:23]
transaction between a word and a token

[01:21:20 - 01:21:26]
now gbd4 has shown impressive results in

[01:21:23 - 01:21:29]
standardizing tests like bar so it has

[01:21:26 - 01:21:31]
passed the bar examination lsats gr Etc

[01:21:29 - 01:21:34]
right so it has it has developed at

[01:21:31 - 01:21:37]
human level intelligence right which has

[01:21:34 - 01:21:39]
Benchmark indexes right now we talk

[01:21:37 - 01:21:42]
about the limitations of gbd4 now there

[01:21:39 - 01:21:44]
are social bies the various prompts that

[01:21:42 - 01:21:49]
are there that is still a challenge that

[01:21:44 - 01:21:51]
gbd4 faces right now gbd4 is preened

[01:21:49 - 01:21:54]
data right whatever the more important

[01:21:51 - 01:21:56]
thing is that it it showcases a bit of

[01:21:54 - 01:21:59]
bias towards things which is not very

[01:21:56 - 01:22:02]
accurate right so the gbt 4 is trained

[01:21:59 - 01:22:04]
till September 2021 it does not

[01:22:02 - 01:22:05]
understand the current scenario of how

[01:22:04 - 01:22:08]
the world is growing the data it

[01:22:05 - 01:22:09]
possesses is from throughout history

[01:22:08 - 01:22:14]
till September

[01:22:09 - 01:22:16]
2021 so for anyone who wants help in

[01:22:14 - 01:22:19]
whatever is going on in today's world

[01:22:16 - 01:22:23]
will not not have any use of Charity per

[01:22:19 - 01:22:26]
se it can rephrase test texts it can

[01:22:23 - 01:22:29]
modify a certain things that you provide

[01:22:26 - 01:22:30]
as an input but it would not consider it

[01:22:29 - 01:22:32]
does not have that knowledge of the

[01:22:30 - 01:22:35]
things that are going on right because

[01:22:32 - 01:22:37]
the data that is input is till September

[01:22:35 - 01:22:40]
2021 now the user need to be cautious

[01:22:37 - 01:22:43]
about inputting prompts that may lead to

[01:22:40 - 01:22:45]
un intended output called jailbreaks

[01:22:43 - 01:22:46]
right so we need to be cautious about it

[01:22:45 - 01:22:48]
it's it may give you results that you

[01:22:46 - 01:22:51]
did not intend

[01:22:48 - 01:22:53]
to have right so this is important then

[01:22:51 - 01:22:55]
gbd4 has a room of improvement and

[01:22:53 - 01:22:57]
understanding in generating language

[01:22:55 - 01:22:58]
other than English it's it's bit more

[01:22:57 - 01:23:01]
biased towards English it understands

[01:22:58 - 01:23:04]
English absolutely in a very incredible

[01:23:01 - 01:23:05]
way but other languages it needs a bit

[01:23:04 - 01:23:09]
of time it needs a bit of understanding

[01:23:05 - 01:23:12]
to develop that it lacks the capability

[01:23:09 - 01:23:16]
to analyze audio or video content right

[01:23:12 - 01:23:19]
still now it image is done but audio and

[01:23:16 - 01:23:22]
video it still has not been developed

[01:23:19 - 01:23:24]
and it is still in process so yeah once

[01:23:22 - 01:23:28]
we get that audio and video one then

[01:23:24 - 01:23:30]
would be another another level of uh GPT

[01:23:28 - 01:23:32]
would be seeing then gp4 occasionally

[01:23:30 - 01:23:34]
makes mathematical errors that a

[01:23:32 - 01:23:36]
calculator would make this is rare

[01:23:34 - 01:23:38]
occasions but it still exists so we need

[01:23:36 - 01:23:41]
to be careful these are the limitations

[01:23:38 - 01:23:44]
of gp4 now the predecessor right the

[01:23:41 - 01:23:47]
charity now it's was developed by open

[01:23:44 - 01:23:50]
AI it's an AI research organization

[01:23:47 - 01:23:53]
which was first nonprofit now it has

[01:23:50 - 01:23:56]
been more profit side uh been on the

[01:23:53 - 01:23:58]
grounds that that it has become a proper

[01:23:56 - 01:24:01]
organization and not nonprofit then

[01:23:58 - 01:24:03]
chart gbt is again gbt architecture that

[01:24:01 - 01:24:07]
has been trained on a large tremendous

[01:24:03 - 01:24:09]
amount of data to give humanik text in

[01:24:07 - 01:24:11]
response right so these are the things

[01:24:09 - 01:24:13]
open AI is the company that builds it

[01:24:11 - 01:24:15]
has done a fantastic job in building

[01:24:13 - 01:24:17]
this chart GPT and the model that we use

[01:24:15 - 01:24:20]
today now after talking about the

[01:24:17 - 01:24:21]
capabilities and limitations of GPD 4

[01:24:20 - 01:24:24]
model now let's talk about how the

[01:24:21 - 01:24:24]
dashboard looks like how it is different

[01:24:24 - 01:24:28]
from

[01:24:24 - 01:24:30]
GPT 3.5 and what are the key differences

[01:24:28 - 01:24:33]
between the free part of it and the paid

[01:24:30 - 01:24:35]
version that is GPT 4 right so what are

[01:24:33 - 01:24:38]
the key features in in a nutshell that

[01:24:35 - 01:24:41]
we discussed as well is about that you

[01:24:38 - 01:24:44]
can input the images in GPD 4 model

[01:24:41 - 01:24:46]
while in case of CH GPD 3.5 you could

[01:24:44 - 01:24:49]
not really put any images you could only

[01:24:46 - 01:24:53]
input text there right so you can input

[01:24:49 - 01:24:55]
text as well as image in in GPT 4 now

[01:24:53 - 01:24:57]
what are the other key differences that

[01:24:55 - 01:25:00]
are there so basically gp4 is an

[01:24:57 - 01:25:03]
advanced model right it has advanced

[01:25:00 - 01:25:06]
capability of logical reasoning its

[01:25:03 - 01:25:09]
structuring is in with enormous large

[01:25:06 - 01:25:12]
amount of data so it's better well

[01:25:09 - 01:25:14]
worsed with how basic functionalities

[01:25:12 - 01:25:17]
work and it has a higher order thinking

[01:25:14 - 01:25:21]
in that perspective so let's look at uh

[01:25:17 - 01:25:25]
chat gp4 dashboard let's log in into it

[01:25:21 - 01:25:27]
so I'll open my uh Chrome window you can

[01:25:25 - 01:25:30]
use uh any search engine that you want

[01:25:27 - 01:25:33]
Chrome or Bing you can just type so the

[01:25:30 - 01:25:38]
parent company that makes GPT charge and

[01:25:33 - 01:25:38]
GPT 4 is open AI so I'll search for open

[01:25:38 - 01:25:45]
AI right this is the first uh link that

[01:25:42 - 01:25:48]
we see is open

[01:25:45 - 01:25:50]
AI right so we can see that uh they have

[01:25:48 - 01:25:52]
a number of things that are they that

[01:25:50 - 01:25:54]
they are working on on building these

[01:25:52 - 01:25:57]
artificial intelligence uh

[01:25:54 - 01:26:00]
products right so one such product that

[01:25:57 - 01:26:02]
we are discussing today is gp4 so let's

[01:26:00 - 01:26:05]
uh go into the product section you can

[01:26:02 - 01:26:06]
see chart GPT is there gp4 is there dii

[01:26:05 - 01:26:09]
is there so there are different types of

[01:26:06 - 01:26:12]
products that this company make in terms

[01:26:09 - 01:26:16]
of artificial intelligence so let's look

[01:26:12 - 01:26:18]
at gbd4 for now so when I click to GPD 4

[01:26:16 - 01:26:21]
now it says that it's the most advanced

[01:26:18 - 01:26:23]
system that produces you know safe and

[01:26:21 - 01:26:26]
more user responsiveness is there right

[01:26:23 - 01:26:28]
so this is uh what the Crux is about

[01:26:26 - 01:26:29]
there you can you can see in the website

[01:26:28 - 01:26:32]
they have talked about what differences

[01:26:29 - 01:26:34]
key differences are there right uh and

[01:26:32 - 01:26:36]
how is the difference from chat chat gbt

[01:26:34 - 01:26:38]
right one such example you can see so

[01:26:36 - 01:26:43]
this input is there in which Andrew is

[01:26:38 - 01:26:46]
free from 11 to 3 joon's free from uh

[01:26:43 - 01:26:49]
from noon to 2:00 p.m. and then 3:30 to

[01:26:46 - 01:26:51]
5: so it basically the Crux behind chart

[01:26:49 - 01:26:54]
gbd and gbd4 is that in gbd4 you get

[01:26:51 - 01:26:57]
more crisp Advanced reasoning answers

[01:26:54 - 01:27:00]
right and you would get a bit more vague

[01:26:57 - 01:27:02]
answers in chart GPT the older model of

[01:27:00 - 01:27:04]
it but you'll get a more precise and

[01:27:02 - 01:27:09]
more crisp results when we talk about

[01:27:04 - 01:27:10]
gbt 4 right and in terms of uh in terms

[01:27:09 - 01:27:14]
of passing the exams right the

[01:27:10 - 01:27:17]
benchmarks that they have set gbt 4 even

[01:27:14 - 01:27:19]
outperformed chart gbt in that regard

[01:27:17 - 01:27:22]
right so if you have you can see uniform

[01:27:19 - 01:27:25]
bar exam CH gbt score 10th and gbd4 90th

[01:27:22 - 01:27:28]
so the this is the level in which it

[01:27:25 - 01:27:32]
performs right so with this it tells

[01:27:28 - 01:27:36]
about how advanced Char gbt 4 model is

[01:27:32 - 01:27:38]
then uh then J gbt right so now let's

[01:27:36 - 01:27:40]
just log in and see what more uh things

[01:27:38 - 01:27:46]
we can do right so let's just log into

[01:27:40 - 01:27:50]
to try on Char gbd 4 plus log

[01:27:46 - 01:27:52]
in right we'll fill in the

[01:27:50 - 01:27:55]
details so after filling in the details

[01:27:52 - 01:27:57]
what we will do is we will just just log

[01:27:55 - 01:28:01]
to the gp4

[01:27:57 - 01:28:04]
model right so this is the sort of user

[01:28:01 - 01:28:07]
uh interface that we have for uh gp4

[01:28:04 - 01:28:10]
it's pretty much the same as gpt3 with

[01:28:07 - 01:28:12]
chart GPT and gp4 what the key

[01:28:10 - 01:28:14]
difference is that it's the UI Remains

[01:28:12 - 01:28:16]
the Same more or less what the

[01:28:14 - 01:28:20]
difference comes in that when you're

[01:28:16 - 01:28:23]
paying for an extra you know ability for

[01:28:20 - 01:28:24]
this model you get the GPT 4 model right

[01:28:23 - 01:28:27]
there but you can always switch back to

[01:28:24 - 01:28:29]
GPT 3.5 in the same window you don't

[01:28:27 - 01:28:31]
need to create any free account for that

[01:28:29 - 01:28:34]
in the paid version as well you can go

[01:28:31 - 01:28:36]
back to 3.5 so what is the major change

[01:28:34 - 01:28:39]
that they have done is that in gp4 you

[01:28:36 - 01:28:42]
cannot use it in in one go how many ever

[01:28:39 - 01:28:45]
prompts you want it is limited it has a

[01:28:42 - 01:28:48]
cap of 25 messages every 3 hours so in

[01:28:45 - 01:28:51]
every 3 hours you can only type in 25

[01:28:48 - 01:28:54]
such uh questions right so this is the

[01:28:51 - 01:28:57]
key then whatever you do after that they

[01:28:54 - 01:28:59]
will revert back to the GPT 3.5 model

[01:28:57 - 01:29:02]
right so these are the key differences

[01:28:59 - 01:29:05]
again now these are the different

[01:29:02 - 01:29:08]
strings or different chat sections that

[01:29:05 - 01:29:09]
are created over here consider it like

[01:29:08 - 01:29:12]
you're using Whatsapp right you have

[01:29:09 - 01:29:13]
numerous threads you have numerous uh

[01:29:12 - 01:29:15]
people that you're talking to right so

[01:29:13 - 01:29:18]
each each individual has a different

[01:29:15 - 01:29:20]
chat options so similarly when you are

[01:29:18 - 01:29:23]
typing in different queries related to

[01:29:20 - 01:29:26]
different sort of uh topics right each

[01:29:23 - 01:29:29]
topic gets created into a different uh

[01:29:26 - 01:29:30]
what do we call it a chat section right

[01:29:29 - 01:29:33]
you you can you have to set it in a

[01:29:30 - 01:29:36]
different chat section so the thing with

[01:29:33 - 01:29:39]
chart GPT and GPT 4 model is that it

[01:29:36 - 01:29:42]
learns from the data that you provide

[01:29:39 - 01:29:49]
right so if I'm typing in XYZ things

[01:29:42 - 01:29:49]
right um hey uh can you tell me

[01:29:50 - 01:29:55]
something about

[01:29:54 - 01:29:58]
[Music]

[01:29:55 - 01:30:02]
marketing right so if I type in such

[01:29:58 - 01:30:05]
things let's just uh type in gbd4 for

[01:30:02 - 01:30:08]
now so what will happen is that when I

[01:30:05 - 01:30:10]
type in and now what it would do is it

[01:30:08 - 01:30:13]
would know that this entire chat would

[01:30:10 - 01:30:16]
be uh created right a new chat would be

[01:30:13 - 01:30:19]
created then what would happen is that

[01:30:16 - 01:30:22]
in the entire conversation it will stick

[01:30:19 - 01:30:23]
its uh brain power to marketing it'll

[01:30:22 - 01:30:26]
know that okay you're talking from the

[01:30:23 - 01:30:29]
market perspective of things right so it

[01:30:26 - 01:30:32]
has that kind of uh data that put that

[01:30:29 - 01:30:34]
you put in it has a sort of memory to

[01:30:32 - 01:30:36]
realize okay this is what the human

[01:30:34 - 01:30:39]
wants me to interact with that is

[01:30:36 - 01:30:41]
marketing right so you'll get a variety

[01:30:39 - 01:30:44]
again as I mentioned that in in the

[01:30:41 - 01:30:47]
differences between GPT 3.5 and 4 model

[01:30:44 - 01:30:50]
is that you get much more crisp results

[01:30:47 - 01:30:53]
right with a lot more better logical

[01:30:50 - 01:30:56]
reasoning and higher order thinking in

[01:30:53 - 01:30:57]
what the user would want right so that

[01:30:56 - 01:31:00]
is why this is what you're paying for

[01:30:57 - 01:31:03]
you're paying for an extra amount of

[01:31:00 - 01:31:06]
preciseness to what you really want the

[01:31:03 - 01:31:08]
answers from gp4 model right again the

[01:31:06 - 01:31:11]
drawbacks is Remains the Same in this

[01:31:08 - 01:31:14]
model itself that it is trained up to

[01:31:11 - 01:31:16]
August or September of 2021 so after

[01:31:14 - 01:31:18]
that any new information that is there

[01:31:16 - 01:31:21]
would not be present in any of these

[01:31:18 - 01:31:24]
models GPD 4 or GPD 3.5 but what you get

[01:31:21 - 01:31:26]
out of uh paying extra what what you get

[01:31:24 - 01:31:29]
out of paying for this service is that

[01:31:26 - 01:31:31]
you get more crisp answers more better

[01:31:29 - 01:31:34]
quality answers and more precise answer

[01:31:31 - 01:31:36]
in to the way you want the answers to be

[01:31:34 - 01:31:38]
right you can type in X number of

[01:31:36 - 01:31:42]
commands right so we'll we'll see all

[01:31:38 - 01:31:43]
these examples when we go ahead right so

[01:31:42 - 01:31:45]
basically this is the user interface

[01:31:43 - 01:31:48]
that they have you can CH you can type

[01:31:45 - 01:31:50]
in your prompts over here you can

[01:31:48 - 01:31:52]
regenerate the response if I do not like

[01:31:50 - 01:31:54]
what I'm seeing over here I can

[01:31:52 - 01:31:55]
regenerate the response right here

[01:31:54 - 01:31:57]
I can tell them right this is for their

[01:31:55 - 01:31:59]
feedback if this was a good one or this

[01:31:57 - 01:32:02]
this was something which is not good so

[01:31:59 - 01:32:04]
this is what uh is there in this uh

[01:32:02 - 01:32:07]
chart as well so you can also make

[01:32:04 - 01:32:09]
changes to the queries the prompts that

[01:32:07 - 01:32:12]
you put in right you can always you know

[01:32:09 - 01:32:14]
modify just like I can change what I

[01:32:12 - 01:32:16]
want to about I can be more precise

[01:32:14 - 01:32:18]
right I can talk about digital marketing

[01:32:16 - 01:32:20]
right so I can save and submit and and

[01:32:18 - 01:32:23]
it would give me much more precise

[01:32:20 - 01:32:25]
answers right so you can always have and

[01:32:23 - 01:32:27]
and it has a memory of its own right so

[01:32:25 - 01:32:28]
it has a memory you can always go back

[01:32:27 - 01:32:30]
to the last promt that you were

[01:32:28 - 01:32:32]
searching for you can always come back

[01:32:30 - 01:32:35]
to the current promt that you're working

[01:32:32 - 01:32:37]
on right so these are the more crisp and

[01:32:35 - 01:32:39]
precise things that are present in the

[01:32:37 - 01:32:42]
gp4 model it is much more advanced in

[01:32:39 - 01:32:45]
terms of higher order thinking right so

[01:32:42 - 01:32:47]
let's move on and let's uh let's learn

[01:32:45 - 01:32:49]
something about uh let's just say

[01:32:47 - 01:32:51]
business or let's just say marketing or

[01:32:49 - 01:32:53]
let's just say content creation right so

[01:32:51 - 01:32:56]
let's just start off with uh with

[01:32:53 - 01:32:59]
marketing at first now let's just talk

[01:32:56 - 01:33:01]
about some general prompts for gb4 let's

[01:32:59 - 01:33:02]
play around with gb4 and see what what

[01:33:01 - 01:33:04]
are the different things what are

[01:33:02 - 01:33:06]
different modifications we we can do in

[01:33:04 - 01:33:08]
our prompts what are different aspects

[01:33:06 - 01:33:10]
we can cover uh from business to

[01:33:08 - 01:33:12]
marketing from the creative side so

[01:33:10 - 01:33:15]
let's talk about some of the different

[01:33:12 - 01:33:17]
uh prompts we can provide to gbd4 so now

[01:33:15 - 01:33:19]
from considering a very creative part of

[01:33:17 - 01:33:22]
it now now I wanted to develop a

[01:33:19 - 01:33:24]
screenplay for a film right so now I've

[01:33:22 - 01:33:26]
added a prompt stating that develop a

[01:33:24 - 01:33:28]
captivating screenplay for a film by

[01:33:26 - 01:33:31]
creating compelling characters

[01:33:28 - 01:33:33]
establishing a intriguing setting and

[01:33:31 - 01:33:35]
writing engaging dialogues craft a

[01:33:33 - 01:33:37]
thrilling narrative filled with an

[01:33:35 - 01:33:40]
unexpected twist to keep the audience

[01:33:37 - 01:33:42]
captivated until the end now what I'm

[01:33:40 - 01:33:45]
trying to do here is that I'm giving it

[01:33:42 - 01:33:47]
number of different parameters to

[01:33:45 - 01:33:49]
consider while developing that

[01:33:47 - 01:33:51]
screenplay right it is captivating

[01:33:49 - 01:33:53]
characters establish an intriguing

[01:33:51 - 01:33:55]
setting writing engaging dialogues right

[01:33:53 - 01:33:58]
right graft a thrilling now I want it to

[01:33:55 - 01:34:00]
be in in the thrilling perspective right

[01:33:58 - 01:34:01]
so all that I have added in this now

[01:34:00 - 01:34:04]
let's see what are the what is the

[01:34:01 - 01:34:04]
result of this

[01:34:12 - 01:34:17]
prompt so now we can see that it has

[01:34:15 - 01:34:19]
given me in the format screen plays are

[01:34:17 - 01:34:22]
made it has given me the sequence of

[01:34:19 - 01:34:23]
things that need to happen so all these

[01:34:22 - 01:34:26]
things are the with the parameters that

[01:34:23 - 01:34:28]
I have given it right the dialogues are

[01:34:26 - 01:34:30]
there the characters are mentioned the

[01:34:28 - 01:34:32]
the location is mentioned where it is

[01:34:30 - 01:34:35]
going to happen right so all these

[01:34:32 - 01:34:38]
things are are set in play when when we

[01:34:35 - 01:34:40]
talk about gbt 4 gbt 3.5 on the other

[01:34:38 - 01:34:42]
hand would give a very vake sort of

[01:34:40 - 01:34:44]
setting it would not give it in the

[01:34:42 - 01:34:47]
format that is there also it would not

[01:34:44 - 01:34:50]
be as engaging as gbt 4 would provide

[01:34:47 - 01:34:52]
right now let's take another example now

[01:34:50 - 01:34:55]
generate a script for a 2minute Facebook

[01:34:52 - 01:34:57]
ad promoting our Innovative Cleaning

[01:34:55 - 01:35:00]
Service right so let's just see what it

[01:34:57 - 01:35:00]
has to

[01:35:03 - 01:35:13]
give now as we can see that as mentioned

[01:35:08 - 01:35:16]
before that gbd4 every string has the

[01:35:13 - 01:35:18]
memory of its own right so the first

[01:35:16 - 01:35:20]
thing that we asked it to do was create

[01:35:18 - 01:35:23]
a screen play right the format should be

[01:35:20 - 01:35:25]
in a screenplay format second one we

[01:35:23 - 01:35:27]
completely Chang change the subject to

[01:35:25 - 01:35:30]
make a 2minute Facebook ad promoting

[01:35:27 - 01:35:32]
Innovative Cleaning Service now what it

[01:35:30 - 01:35:34]
understands is that you want it in a

[01:35:32 - 01:35:37]
screenplay format and to generate a

[01:35:34 - 01:35:38]
script in that format right so what it

[01:35:37 - 01:35:40]
does is it gives me the entire

[01:35:38 - 01:35:43]
screenplay for a cleaning service which

[01:35:40 - 01:35:46]
we do not want it right it gives me a

[01:35:43 - 01:35:48]
thing that I do not want it to give but

[01:35:46 - 01:35:50]
since it has its memory of in every

[01:35:48 - 01:35:52]
thread it gives me it has the memory of

[01:35:50 - 01:35:54]
the previous prompt right now it is

[01:35:52 - 01:35:56]
engaging the previous prompt with the

[01:35:54 - 01:35:59]
current prompt and giving me the results

[01:35:56 - 01:36:00]
accordingly now what if I do not want it

[01:35:59 - 01:36:02]
what should be done you have to create a

[01:36:00 - 01:36:07]
new chat a new string should be created

[01:36:02 - 01:36:11]
click on gbt 4 and then add the same

[01:36:07 - 01:36:11]
prompt that you added in prompt number

[01:36:16 - 01:36:21]
two right so now it has given me a

[01:36:19 - 01:36:24]
script in the format that a script is

[01:36:21 - 01:36:26]
and not a screenplay right so now it has

[01:36:24 - 01:36:28]
given me the opening shot how it needs

[01:36:26 - 01:36:31]
to be there the narration of what what

[01:36:28 - 01:36:32]
uh the script would be like then where

[01:36:31 - 01:36:35]
the camera should be placed what should

[01:36:32 - 01:36:37]
be the setting it has given all those

[01:36:35 - 01:36:40]
three things in in this in a 2minute

[01:36:37 - 01:36:42]
thing and also it has given me that uh

[01:36:40 - 01:36:44]
there's something you want you can ask

[01:36:42 - 01:36:46]
it to Sparkle and shine.com for

[01:36:44 - 01:36:48]
satisfaction is guaranteed so what it is

[01:36:46 - 01:36:51]
like at the end you give a feedback

[01:36:48 - 01:36:54]
right so now this can be the Business

[01:36:51 - 01:36:55]
website for whatever your business is

[01:36:54 - 01:36:58]
you can put your website over here and

[01:36:55 - 01:37:00]
it and in the in the in the script it

[01:36:58 - 01:37:02]
would add the same to it right you just

[01:37:00 - 01:37:04]
have to change it okay change this this

[01:37:02 - 01:37:07]
this from your own Brand's name or your

[01:37:04 - 01:37:09]
Brand's website right so it will do the

[01:37:07 - 01:37:13]
same okay now let's look at one more

[01:37:09 - 01:37:16]
example now I want gbd4 to write me a

[01:37:13 - 01:37:18]
500w article with an exciting tone okay

[01:37:16 - 01:37:20]
so the first parameter that is it is

[01:37:18 - 01:37:23]
considering that I wanted to consider is

[01:37:20 - 01:37:26]
exciting tone that explains the ADV

[01:37:23 - 01:37:28]
advantages of using the virtual reality

[01:37:26 - 01:37:30]
for travel experiences this is the

[01:37:28 - 01:37:32]
second parameter that I'm setting it now

[01:37:30 - 01:37:35]
the third is begin with a compelling

[01:37:32 - 01:37:37]
hook using the Pas formula and conclude

[01:37:35 - 01:37:42]
with a CTA now this is my fourth

[01:37:37 - 01:37:45]
parameter using the P formula and and

[01:37:42 - 01:37:47]
conclude with a call to action promoting

[01:37:45 - 01:37:50]
the virtual VR reality package right now

[01:37:47 - 01:37:54]
let's look at what the response of gp4

[01:37:50 - 01:37:54]
model is this in this regard

[01:37:58 - 01:38:03]
now we have mentioned that begin with a

[01:38:01 - 01:38:05]
compelling hook right now just read the

[01:38:03 - 01:38:08]
hook that it has given right the first

[01:38:05 - 01:38:10]
one this the first para is the hook

[01:38:08 - 01:38:12]
imagine this you standing on the summit

[01:38:10 - 01:38:14]
of Mount Everest feeling the Cool Breeze

[01:38:12 - 01:38:16]
against your face the crunch of the snow

[01:38:14 - 01:38:19]
beneath your boots right so now this

[01:38:16 - 01:38:23]
gives us the initial hook for the user

[01:38:19 - 01:38:25]
to being hooked up to the article that

[01:38:23 - 01:38:28]
I'm writing right you want at the end

[01:38:25 - 01:38:30]

[01:38:30 - 01:38:35]
reads through the entire article you

[01:38:33 - 01:38:38]
don't want it to just read one line and

[01:38:35 - 01:38:42]
go back so the first element the first

[01:38:38 - 01:38:44]
para of this article is about engaging

[01:38:42 - 01:38:47]
that audience engaging that user onto

[01:41:55 - 01:42:01]
gbt 4 and 40 are under chat gbt plus

[01:41:58 - 01:42:04]
version which is subscription model and

[01:42:01 - 01:42:08]
is not free now let's compare chat GPT

[01:42:04 - 01:42:11]
versions chat GPT 3.5 has enhanced

[01:42:08 - 01:42:14]
reasoning abilities but is uni model

[01:42:11 - 01:42:16]
chat GPT 4 mastered multimodel task such

[01:42:14 - 01:42:20]
as understanding and generating text

[01:42:16 - 01:42:23]
from images describe visual content and

[01:42:20 - 01:42:27]
integrating text and images for compreh

[01:42:23 - 01:42:29]
ensive responses and CH gbt 40 optimizes

[01:42:27 - 01:42:32]
these features for faster and more

[01:42:29 - 01:42:34]
accurate responses now let's dive into

[01:42:32 - 01:42:37]
the features introduced in the 40

[01:42:34 - 01:42:40]
version for Chad GPT which is what

[01:42:37 - 01:42:43]
today's video is all about Chad gb4 o

[01:42:40 - 01:42:46]
Builds on the robust Foundation of Chad

[01:42:43 - 01:42:49]
gbt 4 but introduces several

[01:42:46 - 01:42:51]
enhancements such as faster processing

[01:42:49 - 01:42:56]
improved understanding of complex

[01:42:51 - 01:42:59]
queries Etc CH gbt 4 is designed to be

[01:42:56 - 01:43:02]
more efficient more responsive and most

[01:42:59 - 01:43:05]
importantly more human like in its

[01:43:02 - 01:43:08]
interactions but what makes Chad gbt 4

[01:43:05 - 01:43:12]
truly stand out let's explore some of

[01:43:08 - 01:43:14]
its impressive features first CH gp4 can

[01:43:12 - 01:43:18]
detect and respond to emotions making

[01:43:14 - 01:43:20]
conversation feel more natural and

[01:43:18 - 01:43:23]
empathetic now let me show you an

[01:43:20 - 01:43:26]
example of Chad gp4 o in action

[01:43:23 - 01:43:28]
imagine you are working on a research

[01:43:26 - 01:43:31]
project about climate change impacts and

[01:43:28 - 01:43:35]
you need detailed information let's see

[01:43:31 - 01:43:38]
how chat GPT 3.5 4 and 40 handle this

[01:43:35 - 01:43:42]
request first we begin with question for

[01:43:38 - 01:43:44]
3.5 can you provide information on the

[01:43:42 - 01:43:48]
impact of climate change here we see

[01:43:44 - 01:43:50]
that Chad GPT 3.5 gives a brief overview

[01:43:48 - 01:43:54]
though not in a detailed

[01:43:50 - 01:43:56]
manner now let's present the same prompt

[01:43:54 - 01:44:00]
to chat GPT

[01:43:56 - 01:44:02]
4 and what we see is that it gives a

[01:44:00 - 01:44:05]
general overview but not really an

[01:44:02 - 01:44:07]
optimized version of The Prompt asked

[01:44:05 - 01:44:10]
which means a response that is more

[01:44:07 - 01:44:12]
precise accurate and tailor to the

[01:44:10 - 01:44:15]
specific details and context of the

[01:44:12 - 01:44:19]
prompt providing better Clarity and

[01:44:15 - 01:44:23]
relevance but let's see how CH GPT 4

[01:44:19 - 01:44:26]
handles the same request this updated

[01:44:23 - 01:44:29]
response provides a more structured and

[01:44:26 - 01:44:32]
detailed overview of the impact of

[01:44:29 - 01:44:35]
climate change organized into clear

[01:44:32 - 01:44:38]
categories it offers a comprehensive yet

[01:44:35 - 01:44:41]
concise snapshot the key areas affected

[01:44:38 - 01:44:43]
by climate change highlighting both

[01:44:41 - 01:44:46]
immediate and long-term

[01:44:43 - 01:44:49]
consequences second chat GPT 40 is

[01:44:46 - 01:44:52]
optimize to understand and respond to a

[01:44:49 - 01:44:55]
wider range of queries more accurately

[01:44:52 - 01:44:57]
let's look look at an example as a data

[01:44:55 - 01:45:00]
Enthusiast who loves to dive into the

[01:44:57 - 01:45:03]
statistics let's analyze data without

[01:45:00 - 01:45:06]
writing any code how can we explore and

[01:45:03 - 01:45:10]
interpret data effectively using version

[01:45:06 - 01:45:12]
40 so let's give a prompt provide me the

[01:45:10 - 01:45:15]
statistical chart using the data set

[01:45:12 - 01:45:16]
which will give me a clear picture of

[01:45:15 - 01:45:19]
the data

[01:45:16 - 01:45:23]
set do you see the difference in output

[01:45:19 - 01:45:25]
with ch gbt 40 at first glance ch P4

[01:45:23 - 01:45:28]
does not show charts and provides

[01:45:25 - 01:45:30]
information based on the text shared

[01:45:28 - 01:45:33]
which may need further

[01:45:30 - 01:45:35]
refinement however in chart GPT 40 it

[01:45:33 - 01:45:37]
not only displays visualization

[01:45:35 - 01:45:40]
immediately but the charts also feature

[01:45:37 - 01:45:43]
better styling color schemes and

[01:45:40 - 01:45:45]
readability the analysis is more

[01:45:43 - 01:45:48]
sophisticated better identifying Trends

[01:45:45 - 01:45:51]
and patterns it can also provide medians

[01:45:48 - 01:45:54]
quartiles and standard deviation when

[01:45:51 - 01:45:58]
required at additionally this version

[01:45:54 - 01:46:01]
offers more comprehensive explanation

[01:45:58 - 01:46:05]
and interpretations of the visualization

[01:46:01 - 01:46:08]
which deliver clear and more actionable

[01:46:05 - 01:46:10]
insights it also employs more advanced

[01:46:08 - 01:46:13]
techniques for handling missing values

[01:46:10 - 01:46:16]
outliers and data inconsistencies thir

[01:46:13 - 01:46:18]
with support for various plugins such as

[01:46:16 - 01:46:22]
browser integration python for data

[01:46:18 - 01:46:25]
analysis and delay for image generation

[01:46:22 - 01:46:28]
we can extend capabilities to meet our

[01:46:25 - 01:46:31]
specific needs it creates stunning

[01:46:28 - 01:46:33]
images from text prompts directly within

[01:46:31 - 01:46:35]
your chat interface let's talk about

[01:46:33 - 01:46:38]
plugins and delay with the advanced

[01:46:35 - 01:46:42]
plugins you can exchange chat GPT 4 O's

[01:46:38 - 01:46:44]
functionality to do things like schedule

[01:46:42 - 01:46:48]
appointments manage task and even

[01:46:44 - 01:46:50]
control Smart Home devices and with Del

[01:46:48 - 01:46:53]
integration you can generate beautiful

[01:46:50 - 01:46:56]
images from Simple Text prom

[01:46:53 - 01:47:00]
let's see how this differentiates CH GPT

[01:46:56 - 01:47:03]
40 from CH GPT 3.5 and 4 so let's

[01:47:00 - 01:47:05]
explore the creative side with Del

[01:47:03 - 01:47:08]
Integrations and here is a prompt that

[01:47:05 - 01:47:11]
tell us what we are talking about so

[01:47:08 - 01:47:14]
here a prompt is that generate an image

[01:47:11 - 01:47:17]
of a peaceful Countryside scene in the

[01:47:14 - 01:47:19]
evening the scene should include a small

[01:47:17 - 01:47:21]
cottage with smoke coming from the

[01:47:19 - 01:47:24]
chimney surrounded by tall trees and

[01:47:21 - 01:47:28]
river flowing name nearby the sky should

[01:47:24 - 01:47:31]
be painted in shades of orange and pink

[01:47:28 - 01:47:34]
indicating Sunset include a wooden

[01:47:31 - 01:47:37]
bridge over the river and a few birds

[01:47:34 - 01:47:40]
flying in the sky size should be 1024

[01:47:37 - 01:47:44]
into 1024 let's see when we use this

[01:47:40 - 01:47:47]
prompt using 3.5 jbt 3.5 gives this

[01:47:44 - 01:47:50]
beautiful description but it stops there

[01:47:47 - 01:47:53]
now let's jump into Chad GPT 4 and 40

[01:47:50 - 01:47:56]
using the same prompt

[01:47:53 - 01:47:58]
here is your image isn't that amazing

[01:47:56 - 01:48:01]

[01:52:35 - 01:52:40]
Microsoft binge once you open the binge

[01:52:38 - 01:52:41]
on the Chrome you will be directed to

[01:52:40 - 01:52:44]
this page where you can create your

[01:52:41 - 01:52:47]
account I have created my own you can

[01:52:44 - 01:52:49]
click on copilot to give your prompts so

[01:52:47 - 01:52:52]
let me start with first thing so my

[01:52:49 - 01:52:57]
first prompt is I want to

[01:52:52 - 01:53:01]
create an image of a girl holding

[01:52:57 - 01:53:03]
balloons so we'll see what binge gives

[01:53:01 - 01:53:05]
so it is taking time it is telling that

[01:53:03 - 01:53:09]
I'll try to create

[01:53:05 - 01:53:11]
that here you go I got four images of a

[01:53:09 - 01:53:15]
girl holding balloons this is how binge

[01:53:11 - 01:53:17]
helped me creating image now let me ask

[01:53:15 - 01:53:20]
binge to create a code I have given a

[01:53:17 - 01:53:23]
prompt telling it to create a code in C

[01:53:20 - 01:53:25]
for swapping two numbers we'll see what

[01:53:23 - 01:53:25]
it

[01:53:28 - 01:53:34]
gives wow that's awesome it gave me two

[01:53:31 - 01:53:36]
different codes wherein first code is

[01:53:34 - 01:53:39]
using a temporary variable and the

[01:53:36 - 01:53:43]
second code is without using a temporary

[01:53:39 - 01:53:46]
variable so here it gave me a C

[01:53:43 - 01:53:49]
programming code to swap two numbers

[01:53:46 - 01:53:53]
this is how you can use binge AI this is

[01:53:49 - 01:53:56]
how you can leverage binge AI powered by

[01:53:53 - 01:53:59]

prompts so let me give my first prompt

[01:55:11 - 01:55:17]
as create a code I'll give the same

[01:55:13 - 01:55:20]
prompt that is create a code in C for

[01:55:17 - 01:55:24]
swapping two

[01:55:20 - 01:55:26]
numbers and give give enter we'll see

[01:55:24 - 01:55:26]
what it

[01:55:28 - 01:55:34]
gives wow Marlin gives a better result

[01:55:31 - 01:55:36]
so using a temporary variable it gave me

[01:55:34 - 01:55:39]
a code and without using a temporary

[01:55:36 - 01:55:41]
variable it again gave me one more code

[01:55:39 - 01:55:45]
and method three also using bitwise

[01:55:41 - 01:55:48]
exort operation also so this is how you

using Chad GP 40 on the Chad GP open AI

[01:56:20 - 01:56:26]
so here we will see how to use Chad GPT

[01:56:23 - 01:56:29]
40 for free on the default model that is

[01:56:26 - 01:56:33]
3.5 so I'll give my prompt here on the

[01:56:29 - 01:56:37]
default model that is 3.5 so I will ask

[01:56:33 - 01:56:43]
the uh chat GPT to create a definition

[01:56:37 - 01:56:46]
of what is software testing in

[01:56:43 - 01:56:46]
software

[01:56:46 - 01:56:51]
development so the default model is

[01:56:49 - 01:56:53]
giving us the result so it is telling

[01:56:51 - 01:56:56]
what software Ware testing is and the

[01:56:53 - 01:56:58]
key objectives of software testing and

[01:56:56 - 01:57:01]
different types of software testing and

[01:56:58 - 01:57:05]
the levels also is given and we also got

[01:57:01 - 01:57:08]
some common techniques in software

[01:57:05 - 01:57:11]
testing so this is the result of the

[01:57:08 - 01:57:13]
default model now below the result we

[01:57:11 - 01:57:16]
have an option of changing the model to

[01:57:13 - 01:57:18]
40 if I click on the change model we'll

[01:57:16 - 01:57:23]
see what we get

[01:57:18 - 01:57:25]
right so as you see chat gp4 o model is

[01:57:23 - 01:57:28]
generating the better result when

[01:57:25 - 01:57:30]
compared to our default model it is

[01:57:28 - 01:57:32]
telling the types in detail what is

[01:57:30 - 01:57:33]
manual testing what is automation

[01:57:32 - 01:57:36]
testing what are the techniques that are

[01:57:33 - 01:57:40]
used and the stages in techniques it is

free to skim through the video as per

[01:59:41 - 01:59:46]
the timestamps provided in the

[01:59:43 - 01:59:48]
description now let's understand what is

[01:59:46 - 01:59:51]
prompt

[01:59:48 - 01:59:52]
engineering prompt engineering is as

[01:59:51 - 01:59:56]
much

[01:59:52 - 01:59:57]
an art as it is a science a very

[01:59:56 - 02:00:00]
creative

[01:59:57 - 02:00:03]
line we'll come back to this once we

[02:00:00 - 02:00:05]
understand what is actually prompt

[02:00:03 - 02:00:09]
engineering prompt engineering is made

[02:00:05 - 02:00:13]
up of two words prompt and Engineering

[02:00:09 - 02:00:16]
prompt is nothing but a detailed set of

[02:00:13 - 02:00:20]
guidelines or instructions given to the

[02:00:16 - 02:00:26]
llm or generative model to do a

[02:00:20 - 02:00:31]
task engineering is developing

[02:00:26 - 02:00:36]
iteratively a task specific prompt to

[02:00:31 - 02:00:40]
enable the generative models or llms to

[02:00:36 - 02:00:43]
Output a perfect or near

[02:00:40 - 02:00:47]
perfect outcome that you have focused

[02:00:43 - 02:00:52]
for so if you see prompt engineering is

[02:00:47 - 02:00:55]
an iterative process how first is the

[02:00:52 - 02:01:00]
idea that comes to you that you want

[02:00:55 - 02:01:00]
this then you have prompt you design a

[02:01:01 - 02:01:06]
prompt

[02:01:03 - 02:01:10]
then there are results you give that to

[02:01:06 - 02:01:13]
your model your chart GPT okay and then

[02:01:10 - 02:01:17]
you have to test you have a feedback

[02:01:13 - 02:01:21]
right so basically it's a

[02:01:17 - 02:01:23]
process a iterative process now once you

[02:01:21 - 02:01:26]
have the prompt and you have the results

[02:01:23 - 02:01:30]
you might be not very much satisfied

[02:01:26 - 02:01:34]
with the result this is where you

[02:01:30 - 02:01:37]
develop or you have a conversation with

[02:01:34 - 02:01:41]
your chat GPT with your model

[02:01:37 - 02:01:47]
and enforce or reinforce the model to

[02:01:41 - 02:01:50]
give you a good result a good output

[02:01:47 - 02:01:54]
which is what you want for example if

[02:01:50 - 02:01:56]
you have a task on on code

[02:01:54 - 02:02:01]
Generation

[02:01:56 - 02:02:03]
Now a specific problem statement can be

[02:02:01 - 02:02:08]
solved through various

[02:02:03 - 02:02:11]
methods for example you want to uh

[02:02:08 - 02:02:15]
output palindrome palindrome can be done

[02:02:11 - 02:02:18]
by Brute Force palindrome can also be

[02:02:15 - 02:02:22]
done by recursive method

[02:02:18 - 02:02:25]
recursion for example when you give chat

[02:02:22 - 02:02:28]
GPT a prompt it will first give you a

[02:02:25 - 02:02:31]
brute force method you have to keep on

[02:02:28 - 02:02:35]
instructing and providing

[02:02:31 - 02:02:39]
an attempt or providing a prompt to chat

[02:02:35 - 02:02:40]
GPT so that it gives you an optimized

[02:02:39 - 02:02:43]
version for your

[02:02:40 - 02:02:47]
code this is an example for code

[02:02:43 - 02:02:49]
generation similarly suppose you have

[02:02:47 - 02:02:52]
content creation you want to create a

[02:02:49 - 02:02:55]
content and your content that you want

[02:02:52 - 02:02:57]
to create is directed towards a specific

[02:02:55 - 02:03:00]
target

[02:02:57 - 02:03:03]
audience now when you give chat gbt a

[02:03:00 - 02:03:06]
prompt the results it will show you that

[02:03:03 - 02:03:11]
might not be satisfying enough you have

[02:03:06 - 02:03:14]
to tell your chat GPT or your generative

[02:03:11 - 02:03:19]
model iteratively what you want give

[02:03:14 - 02:03:22]
them a feedback for example you have not

[02:03:19 - 02:03:24]
received a good output what will tell

[02:03:22 - 02:03:30]
your chat GPT for

[02:03:24 - 02:03:30]
example this is not I want please

[02:03:31 - 02:03:39]
generate the output based on my target

[02:03:35 - 02:03:41]
audience or based on my feedback

[02:03:39 - 02:03:45]
provided right that's where your

[02:03:41 - 02:03:48]
feedback or test comes into picture you

[02:03:45 - 02:03:51]
have to have a conversation with your

[02:03:48 - 02:03:53]
generative model or for in this case if

[02:03:51 - 02:03:56]
you say ch GPT give them a feedback

[02:03:53 - 02:03:58]
constant feedback it is good it is bad

[02:03:56 - 02:04:03]
it is what specific part you want it to

[02:03:58 - 02:04:06]
be changed right all these things are an

[02:04:03 - 02:04:09]
iterative process that's why we say

[02:04:06 - 02:04:12]
prompt engineering is an iterative

[02:04:09 - 02:04:14]
process based on the guidelines or the

[02:04:12 - 02:04:17]
detailed set of instructions that you

[02:04:14 - 02:04:21]
provide for a specific

[02:04:17 - 02:04:24]
task now let's go back a bit we said

[02:04:21 - 02:04:29]
when we started about prompt engineering

[02:04:24 - 02:04:30]
that it is an art as it is a science how

[02:04:29 - 02:04:33]
it is an

[02:04:30 - 02:04:36]
art it is an art because when you

[02:04:33 - 02:04:40]
conceive an idea and when you write a

[02:04:36 - 02:04:41]
prompt it is your creativity which comes

[02:04:40 - 02:04:44]
into

[02:04:41 - 02:04:48]
picture however the science part comes

[02:04:44 - 02:04:52]
in when you provide your generative

[02:04:48 - 02:04:55]
model or llm or in this case chat G P

[02:04:52 - 02:04:57]
The Prompt and it gives you the result

[02:04:55 - 02:05:00]
because in the back end there is

[02:04:57 - 02:05:02]
something called generative models there

[02:05:00 - 02:05:04]
something called different Transformers

[02:05:02 - 02:05:07]
or architectures that are going into

[02:05:04 - 02:05:11]
picture where billions of parameters are

[02:05:07 - 02:05:15]
playing a role to give you this

[02:05:11 - 02:05:18]
result that becomes your science part of

[02:05:15 - 02:05:23]
it that's why prompt engineering is

[02:05:18 - 02:05:25]
combination of both an art and science

[02:05:23 - 02:05:27]
now that you have understood what is

[02:05:25 - 02:05:33]
prompt

[02:05:27 - 02:05:36]
engineering let's go and see the vital

[02:05:33 - 02:05:40]
the main element of prompt engineering

[02:05:36 - 02:05:42]
that is prompts without which generative

[02:05:40 - 02:05:46]
model chat GPT will not

[02:05:42 - 02:05:50]
work prompts are constituted or it

[02:05:46 - 02:05:54]
contains two parts majorly that is

[02:05:50 - 02:05:56]
parameters and structure what will be

[02:05:54 - 02:05:59]
the structure and what will be the

[02:05:56 - 02:06:02]
parameters of your prompts that when you

[02:05:59 - 02:06:04]
design it you have to think so that you

[02:06:02 - 02:06:07]
have an optimized

[02:06:04 - 02:06:10]
result now structure is one thing that

[02:06:07 - 02:06:13]
we'll talk more about and parameters

[02:06:10 - 02:06:17]
here let me explain I have only Selected

[02:06:13 - 02:06:20]
Few parameters you can search more there

[02:06:17 - 02:06:22]
are more parameters on which uh prompts

[02:06:20 - 02:06:24]
work major

[02:06:22 - 02:06:27]
here we are highlighting only three

[02:06:24 - 02:06:31]
parameters that is temperature top p and

[02:06:27 - 02:06:34]
max length temperature

[02:06:31 - 02:06:37]
is the randomness that comes into

[02:06:34 - 02:06:38]
picture when you provide that parameter

[02:06:37 - 02:06:42]
to your

[02:06:38 - 02:06:45]
prompt it ranges from 0 to

[02:06:42 - 02:06:49]
1 and if you want your model to be

[02:06:45 - 02:06:52]
creative and generate creative answers

[02:06:49 - 02:06:57]
or generate creative outcomes your range

[02:06:52 - 02:07:01]
or you set your temperature to 0.7 to

[02:06:57 - 02:07:03]
0.8 however in task such as code

[02:07:01 - 02:07:05]
generation you don't need

[02:07:03 - 02:07:08]
creativity so you can set your

[02:07:05 - 02:07:10]
temperature to zero also where you do

[02:07:08 - 02:07:13]
not want

[02:07:10 - 02:07:18]
creativity now top

[02:07:13 - 02:07:22]
p is actually kind of same as

[02:07:18 - 02:07:25]
temperature it also has

[02:07:22 - 02:07:28]
creativity top p is top probability that

[02:07:25 - 02:07:31]
it selects from

[02:07:28 - 02:07:35]
so you have a generative model it

[02:07:31 - 02:07:38]
generates results based on your prompt

[02:07:35 - 02:07:42]
now there can be n number of results how

[02:07:38 - 02:07:44]
does that model decide what to put as a

[02:07:42 - 02:07:48]
output for

[02:07:44 - 02:07:51]
you here top P comes into picture more

[02:07:48 - 02:07:55]
the top P more you have different

[02:07:51 - 02:07:57]
creative answers right so low for

[02:07:55 - 02:08:01]
factual high for

[02:07:57 - 02:08:05]
diverse last is max length again it is

[02:08:01 - 02:08:09]
written manage your response length this

[02:08:05 - 02:08:12]
parameter is to control the cost of your

[02:08:09 - 02:08:17]
generative model as

[02:08:12 - 02:08:17]
well so now you have understood what is

[02:08:17 - 02:08:20]
prompt

[02:08:17 - 02:08:21]
engineering what is a prompt and what

[02:08:20 - 02:08:24]
are the two

[02:08:21 - 02:08:26]
main components of your prompt that is

[02:08:24 - 02:08:30]
parameter and structure now let's see

[02:08:26 - 02:08:34]
components of a good prompt what we mean

[02:08:30 - 02:08:37]
by good prompt is that your chat GPT

[02:08:34 - 02:08:41]
your generative model gives you a good

[02:08:37 - 02:08:42]
output your good outcome and you have

[02:08:41 - 02:08:45]
less

[02:08:42 - 02:08:48]
feedbacks for your chat GPT or

[02:08:45 - 02:08:52]
generative model now let's

[02:08:48 - 02:08:55]
see the first or I would say the first

[02:08:52 - 02:08:57]
two are context and

[02:08:55 - 02:09:00]
instruction these are interchangeable

[02:08:57 - 02:09:02]
how you want to design your prompt if

[02:09:00 - 02:09:05]
you want to keep

[02:09:02 - 02:09:07]
instruction first and then context in

[02:09:05 - 02:09:10]
your prompt you can do the same if you

[02:09:07 - 02:09:11]
want to keep the context first and then

[02:09:10 - 02:09:14]
instruction you can do the

[02:09:11 - 02:09:16]
same context is an additional

[02:09:14 - 02:09:20]
information that you want to provide to

[02:09:16 - 02:09:24]
your model instruction is a specific

[02:09:20 - 02:09:27]
task that you want your model to perform

[02:09:24 - 02:09:30]
for example if you want to summarize

[02:09:27 - 02:09:33]
some text that is your instruction

[02:09:30 - 02:09:36]
summarize your text summarize this text

[02:09:33 - 02:09:39]
context is why you want to summarize

[02:09:36 - 02:09:42]
what is the outcome you want to achieve

[02:09:39 - 02:09:44]
for example going back

[02:09:42 - 02:09:46]
to

[02:09:44 - 02:09:49]
Tesla there you are providing an

[02:09:46 - 02:09:52]
instruction to summarize but the context

[02:09:49 - 02:09:54]
is that you want a

[02:09:52 - 02:09:58]
Business Report from a business report

[02:09:54 - 02:10:01]
you want what is the profit from 2020 to

[02:09:58 - 02:10:04]
2023 right so that is the context that

[02:10:01 - 02:10:05]
you need to set why do you want this why

[02:10:04 - 02:10:10]
it is

[02:10:05 - 02:10:15]
needed next is the input data okay what

[02:10:10 - 02:10:17]
is your input data for the example Tesla

[02:10:15 - 02:10:19]
example the input data is your business

[02:10:17 - 02:10:23]
report or business article that you will

[02:10:19 - 02:10:28]
provide to chat GPT and output indicator

[02:10:23 - 02:10:31]
is what how what and how you want as an

[02:10:28 - 02:10:34]
output for example you want in a CSV

[02:10:31 - 02:10:35]
format your output suppose you want in a

[02:10:34 - 02:10:39]
tabular

[02:10:35 - 02:10:43]
format or you want in a graphical format

[02:10:39 - 02:10:48]
so you have to tell what kind of output

[02:10:43 - 02:10:50]
or what format of output you want so

[02:10:48 - 02:10:52]
these are the four components of a good

[02:10:50 - 02:10:54]
promt

[02:10:52 - 02:10:58]
if your prompt consists of these four

[02:10:54 - 02:11:01]
things you are enabling your generative

[02:10:58 - 02:11:02]
model your chat GP to give you better

[02:11:01 - 02:11:05]
and good

[02:11:02 - 02:11:08]
results now let's see an example here we

[02:11:05 - 02:11:11]
will see um sentiment

[02:11:08 - 02:11:15]
analysis we are setting up a

[02:11:11 - 02:11:17]
context it is written act as a analyst

[02:11:15 - 02:11:21]
you're acting as you are asking your

[02:11:17 - 02:11:24]
chart GPT to act like an analyst working

[02:11:21 - 02:11:27]
for an OT platform you are saying your

[02:11:24 - 02:11:30]
chat GP that you will have to perform

[02:11:27 - 02:11:33]
sentiment analysis based on the feedback

[02:11:30 - 02:11:36]
provided by the consumers you are

[02:11:33 - 02:11:39]
working for an OD platform your

[02:11:36 - 02:11:43]
consumers are the users that are seeing

[02:11:39 - 02:11:45]
your movies your web series now the

[02:11:43 - 02:11:48]
feedback that they provide on that you

[02:11:45 - 02:11:50]
have to do sentiment analysis this is

[02:11:48 - 02:11:52]
the context that you are giving to your

[02:11:50 - 02:11:54]
chat gbt

[02:11:52 - 02:11:58]
now giving

[02:11:54 - 02:12:01]
this your charity knows

[02:11:58 - 02:12:05]
that they need to think from an analyst

[02:12:01 - 02:12:09]
perspective they need to do sentiment

[02:12:05 - 02:12:11]
analysis now second is instruction you

[02:12:09 - 02:12:16]
are saying to chat GPT to

[02:12:11 - 02:12:18]
classify the feedback into neutral

[02:12:16 - 02:12:21]
negative

[02:12:18 - 02:12:24]
positive where you are instructing or

[02:12:21 - 02:12:27]
telling your chat GPT that what is

[02:12:24 - 02:12:31]
positive positive means your consumer is

[02:12:27 - 02:12:34]
your promoter negative means they are

[02:12:31 - 02:12:37]
demo neutral means they are neither

[02:12:34 - 02:12:38]
promoter or demoor they are neutral

[02:12:37 - 02:12:41]
towards your

[02:12:38 - 02:12:43]
content this is the instruction that you

[02:12:41 - 02:12:45]
give what the chat GPT or what

[02:12:43 - 02:12:51]
generative model needs to

[02:12:45 - 02:12:55]
do this is what it is doing classifying

[02:12:51 - 02:12:57]
next is your input data and your output

[02:12:55 - 02:13:00]
indicator before that let's see an

[02:12:57 - 02:13:03]
example a good

[02:13:00 - 02:13:04]
prompt while you giving a good prompt if

[02:13:03 - 02:13:08]
you

[02:13:04 - 02:13:11]
give examples for your generative model

[02:13:08 - 02:13:16]
here in this case we are using chart GPT

[02:13:11 - 02:13:19]
if you give them an example they will

[02:13:16 - 02:13:25]
learn from this example

[02:13:19 - 02:13:28]
and train your input data to give the

[02:13:25 - 02:13:31]
output here we have given two examples

[02:13:28 - 02:13:33]
feedback first feedback is I think the

[02:13:31 - 02:13:37]
series was

[02:13:33 - 02:13:39]
okay second feedback is the acting of

[02:13:37 - 02:13:44]
each character in the series was

[02:13:39 - 02:13:48]
awesome so I think the series was okay

[02:13:44 - 02:13:49]
it took this okay as neutral so this is

[02:13:48 - 02:13:51]
a sentiment

[02:13:49 - 02:13:54]
neutral here

[02:13:51 - 02:13:57]
awesome it took as positive so your

[02:13:54 - 02:14:01]
sentiment becomes

[02:13:57 - 02:14:05]
positive now your input data is the

[02:14:01 - 02:14:09]
story line for the series was repetitive

[02:14:05 - 02:14:11]
and abysmal and your output indicator

[02:14:09 - 02:14:16]
here is sentiment what is the sentiment

[02:14:11 - 02:14:19]
for this you're asking your chat GPT

[02:14:16 - 02:14:21]
what will be the sentiment of this

[02:14:19 - 02:14:25]
entire prompt

[02:14:21 - 02:14:28]
that is your context that you have given

[02:14:25 - 02:14:30]
which tells charity to act as an analyst

[02:14:28 - 02:14:34]
and do sentiment

[02:14:30 - 02:14:37]
analysis it gives an instruction to

[02:14:34 - 02:14:41]
classify the feedback provided that is

[02:14:37 - 02:14:47]
your input data and classify that

[02:14:41 - 02:14:50]
feedback into positive negative and

[02:14:47 - 02:14:53]
neutral here you and here you are giving

[02:14:50 - 02:14:58]
examp examples for the same so that your

[02:14:53 - 02:15:00]
chat GPT can understand learn and then

[02:14:58 - 02:15:04]
act

[02:15:00 - 02:15:07]
accordingly now the output for this

[02:15:04 - 02:15:11]
particular feedback is

[02:15:07 - 02:15:14]
negative so if you copy paste this into

[02:15:11 - 02:15:18]
your chat GPT it gives you a output as

[02:15:14 - 02:15:18]
negative for this

[02:15:18 - 02:15:24]
sentence so this is

[02:15:21 - 02:15:27]
how you should write your prompt which

[02:15:24 - 02:15:31]
is good these are the components good

[02:15:27 - 02:15:33]
components of for your prompt so that

[02:15:31 - 02:15:35]
the output that chat gbd generates for

[02:15:33 - 02:15:37]
you

[02:15:35 - 02:15:40]
is

[02:15:37 - 02:15:44]
exact for you to work

[02:15:40 - 02:15:46]
upon so this is what we understood about

[02:15:44 - 02:15:48]
components of a good prompt now that you

[02:15:46 - 02:15:52]
have seen what are the different

[02:15:48 - 02:15:56]
components of a good prompt let's have a

[02:15:52 - 02:16:00]
look at a good checklist that you can

[02:15:56 - 02:16:04]
keep in mind while designing a effective

[02:16:00 - 02:16:08]
prompt for better results so the first

[02:16:04 - 02:16:11]
one is defining the goal telling chat

[02:16:08 - 02:16:14]
gbt what exactly you want to do that is

[02:16:11 - 02:16:18]
called defining the

[02:16:14 - 02:16:22]
goal next is detail out the

[02:16:18 - 02:16:27]
format format is output format that you

[02:16:22 - 02:16:29]
want chat GPT to provide you for example

[02:16:27 - 02:16:33]
as I told you previously it can be table

[02:16:29 - 02:16:36]
paragraph list csvs anything that you

[02:16:33 - 02:16:39]
want and you can give it in a priority

[02:16:36 - 02:16:41]
order also ask chbt to give you in a

[02:16:39 - 02:16:44]
priority order if you are working on

[02:16:41 - 02:16:47]
such uh

[02:16:44 - 02:16:49]
content next is creating a role if you

[02:16:47 - 02:16:51]
remember the previous prompt that we

[02:16:49 - 02:16:53]
discussed

[02:16:51 - 02:17:00]
while learning about components of a

[02:16:53 - 02:17:02]
good prompt we told as a context act

[02:17:00 - 02:17:07]
like a

[02:17:02 - 02:17:11]
analyst that is creating a role so that

[02:17:07 - 02:17:14]
chat GPT assigns or processes based on

[02:17:11 - 02:17:16]
your request based on that role that you

[02:17:14 - 02:17:20]
are have

[02:17:16 - 02:17:23]
asked next is Clarity who the audience

[02:17:20 - 02:17:26]
is or clarify the who the audience is

[02:17:23 - 02:17:29]
basically you are telling chart GPT

[02:17:26 - 02:17:33]
please generate the output based on the

[02:17:29 - 02:17:36]
demography of my audience whom I am

[02:17:33 - 02:17:39]
catering to it can be beginner

[02:17:36 - 02:17:42]
level intermediate Advanced if you are

[02:17:39 - 02:17:46]
creating any content if you are creating

[02:17:42 - 02:17:50]
code it can be foundational functional

[02:17:46 - 02:17:54]
expert based on the audience it can also

[02:17:50 - 02:17:58]
if you a teacher and you are using chat

[02:17:54 - 02:18:03]
GPT you can specify I want to teach

[02:17:58 - 02:18:07]
fractions from a sixth class learner

[02:18:03 - 02:18:09]
perspective or if you want to create a

[02:18:07 - 02:18:12]
Content or if you are working on

[02:18:09 - 02:18:15]
something and you want to make someone

[02:18:12 - 02:18:19]
understand that particular concept for

[02:18:15 - 02:18:24]
example I want a 10-year-old to

[02:18:19 - 02:18:28]
understand what is prompt how would I

[02:18:24 - 02:18:31]
make that particular learner

[02:18:28 - 02:18:33]
understand that kind of clarity that

[02:18:31 - 02:18:37]
kind of clarifications when you put in

[02:18:33 - 02:18:38]
your prompt what is your target audience

[02:18:37 - 02:18:42]
it will

[02:18:38 - 02:18:46]
generate tailored feedbacks tailor

[02:18:42 - 02:18:50]
outputs for your

[02:18:46 - 02:18:52]
prompt next is giving context basically

[02:18:50 - 02:18:56]
you are giving every possible additional

[02:18:52 - 02:18:59]
information for chat GPT in your prompt

[02:18:56 - 02:19:03]
so that the purpose of your request is

[02:18:59 - 02:19:05]
clarified to chat gbt and the response

[02:19:03 - 02:19:08]
that it generates

[02:19:05 - 02:19:08]
is what you

[02:19:09 - 02:19:15]
want next is giving examples we saw in

[02:19:12 - 02:19:18]
the previous components while we were

[02:19:15 - 02:19:21]
understanding components that giving

[02:19:18 - 02:19:25]
example trains your chart GPT or or

[02:19:21 - 02:19:27]
makes it understand that what you want

[02:19:25 - 02:19:28]
and it learns from it to produce

[02:19:27 - 02:19:32]
accurate

[02:19:28 - 02:19:34]
results next is specifying the style it

[02:19:32 - 02:19:36]
can be communication style if you're

[02:19:34 - 02:19:39]
working with a brand it can be how your

[02:19:36 - 02:19:43]
brand Works communication Styles such as

[02:19:39 - 02:19:46]
informal formal what do you want to do

[02:19:43 - 02:19:50]
so it's suitable for your

[02:19:46 - 02:19:53]
response next is defining the scope when

[02:19:50 - 02:19:56]
you outline the scope with

[02:19:53 - 02:20:00]
specifications besides giving context

[02:19:56 - 02:20:01]
and examples chat GPT operates within

[02:20:00 - 02:20:03]
those

[02:20:01 - 02:20:06]
parameters for

[02:20:03 - 02:20:08]
example temperature when you are telling

[02:20:06 - 02:20:14]
okay I want to be creative my

[02:20:08 - 02:20:16]
temperature is this I want my uh top P

[02:20:14 - 02:20:22]
to be this right you are defining the

[02:20:16 - 02:20:24]
scope for your chart GPT

[02:20:22 - 02:20:26]
applying restrictions restrictions

[02:20:24 - 02:20:30]
becomes your what

[02:20:26 - 02:20:33]
is supposing length that you

[02:20:30 - 02:20:36]
want the output length the token length

[02:20:33 - 02:20:40]
that you want a there is a restriction

[02:20:36 - 02:20:43]
but what is that you

[02:20:40 - 02:20:45]
want when you apply those

[02:20:43 - 02:20:48]
restrictions that

[02:20:45 - 02:20:51]
constraints will create right boundaries

[02:20:48 - 02:20:55]
for chart gbt to produce relevant

[02:20:51 - 02:20:57]
responses so all these are checklists

[02:20:55 - 02:21:00]
that you can keep in

[02:20:57 - 02:21:03]
mind again these all uh pointers in your

[02:21:00 - 02:21:06]
checklist revolves around all the

[02:21:03 - 02:21:09]
components of a good prompt that we have

[02:21:06 - 02:21:11]
already seen But as a checklist you can

[02:21:09 - 02:21:14]
keep in mind that okay these are my

[02:21:11 - 02:21:17]
pointers which I can follow when I'm

[02:21:14 - 02:21:20]
designing my

[02:21:17 - 02:21:24]
prompt so this is how you can write a

[02:21:20 - 02:21:28]
good prompt so now let's understand what

[02:21:24 - 02:21:28]
are the different prompt

[02:21:29 - 02:21:39]
patterns one is your persona

[02:21:33 - 02:21:42]
patterns act as X do the task as

[02:21:39 - 02:21:45]
why as a yoga instructor create a

[02:21:42 - 02:21:46]
beginner friendly routine for joint

[02:21:45 - 02:21:52]
Mobility for

[02:21:46 - 02:21:52]
example this is your persona pattern

[02:21:53 - 02:22:01]
next is your audience Persona pattern

[02:21:56 - 02:22:05]
for example in the previous bit I told

[02:22:01 - 02:22:09]
explain this concept supposing prompt

[02:22:05 - 02:22:12]
explain prompt to me assume that I am a

[02:22:09 - 02:22:16]
10year old

[02:22:12 - 02:22:19]
child or another example that is there

[02:22:16 - 02:22:21]
explain the importance of eating greens

[02:22:19 - 02:22:27]
assume I am a skeptical

[02:22:21 - 02:22:30]
child so you are trying to tell Chad GPT

[02:22:27 - 02:22:34]
that what is your audience

[02:22:30 - 02:22:36]
Persona and you are writing your prompt

[02:22:34 - 02:22:39]
or designing your prompt having the

[02:22:36 - 02:22:43]
correct bits explain to me assume I'm

[02:22:39 - 02:22:44]
this or previously Persona pattern act

[02:22:43 - 02:22:49]
like

[02:22:44 - 02:22:50]
this next is visualization generator

[02:22:49 - 02:22:54]
pattern

[02:22:50 - 02:22:57]
now I have a tool I want

[02:22:54 - 02:23:02]
to generate a data for

[02:22:57 - 02:23:07]
example and provide that data to my

[02:23:02 - 02:23:10]
tool so it can be generate X that can be

[02:23:07 - 02:23:13]
provided to Tool y for visualization for

[02:23:10 - 02:23:16]
data analysis for anything it can

[02:23:13 - 02:23:21]
generate data in table table format it

[02:23:16 - 02:23:23]
can generate csvs that can be provided

[02:23:21 - 02:23:25]
that you can download and provide it to

[02:23:23 - 02:23:27]
your tool for visualization data

[02:23:25 - 02:23:29]
analysis task modeling uh machine

[02:23:27 - 02:23:34]
learning tasks

[02:23:29 - 02:23:37]
anything so these are the first three

[02:23:34 - 02:23:39]
prompt patterns Persona pattern audience

[02:23:37 - 02:23:43]
Persona pattern visualization generator

[02:23:39 - 02:23:45]
pattern now let's see the next pattern

[02:23:43 - 02:23:49]
that is recipe

[02:23:45 - 02:23:51]
pattern for example you want to do X

[02:23:49 - 02:23:54]
task

[02:23:51 - 02:23:57]
but to perform this x task there are

[02:23:54 - 02:24:04]
steps or subtasks a B and

[02:23:57 - 02:24:07]
C so I want chat GPT to have a complete

[02:24:04 - 02:24:10]
itenary generated for me if I'm

[02:24:07 - 02:24:14]
traveling from Bangalore to daring and

[02:24:10 - 02:24:15]
from there I can take a train or a cap

[02:24:14 - 02:24:18]
to

[02:24:15 - 02:24:20]
dodging now based on this I am telling

[02:24:18 - 02:24:23]
charj to complete my

[02:24:20 - 02:24:27]
itary this is a recipe pattern where you

[02:24:23 - 02:24:30]
know you want to do X task and you know

[02:24:27 - 02:24:35]
that a b c are the sub uh tasks or the

[02:24:30 - 02:24:38]
steps that are necessary for you to do

[02:24:35 - 02:24:41]
that X task so this is the recipe

[02:24:38 - 02:24:45]
pattern next is your template pattern

[02:24:41 - 02:24:47]
where you provide or as a user I provide

[02:24:45 - 02:24:49]
the chat GPD or generative model with

[02:24:47 - 02:24:51]
placeholder with a template and a

[02:24:49 - 02:24:55]
placeholder

[02:24:51 - 02:24:58]
so that my output chat GPT fits my

[02:24:55 - 02:25:03]
outputs in those placeholders for

[02:24:58 - 02:25:05]
example I want a day wise travel itinary

[02:25:03 - 02:25:08]
if I'm visiting to Paris I'm telling

[02:25:05 - 02:25:11]
Chad GP to generate day wise travel

[02:25:08 - 02:25:15]
itinary for visiting

[02:25:11 - 02:25:18]
Paris now my placeholders are day for

[02:25:15 - 02:25:22]
the day uh of the travel supposing

[02:25:18 - 02:25:26]
Monday location in Paris what location

[02:25:22 - 02:25:29]
I'm traveling to activity what in that

[02:25:26 - 02:25:33]
location I plan to

[02:25:29 - 02:25:37]
do time what is the best time or best

[02:25:33 - 02:25:41]
part of the day to travel or to go

[02:25:37 - 02:25:44]
there this is my entire template and how

[02:25:41 - 02:25:52]
I want the uh output it's indicated for

[02:25:44 - 02:25:56]
day visit location at time for activity

[02:25:52 - 02:26:00]
so if Char GP generates it will give you

[02:25:56 - 02:26:04]
for Monday visit location X at

[02:26:00 - 02:26:10]
time noon for activity visiting museum

[02:26:04 - 02:26:13]
for example so this becomes your entire

[02:26:10 - 02:26:16]
output and you're giving the template

[02:26:13 - 02:26:21]
you're giving placeholders that place my

[02:26:16 - 02:26:24]
information in these and generate output

[02:26:21 - 02:26:28]
in the form of this line for day visit

[02:26:24 - 02:26:33]
location at time for activity containing

[02:26:28 - 02:26:38]
everything so these are your five prompt

[02:26:33 - 02:26:41]
patterns that you can embibe while

[02:26:38 - 02:26:45]
designing your prompts so that you have

[02:26:41 - 02:26:47]
better responses from chart GPT and also

[02:26:45 - 02:26:51]
you understand what you want to do you

[02:26:47 - 02:26:52]
have a Clarity what you want to do and

[02:26:51 - 02:26:56]
work

[02:26:52 - 02:27:01]
accordingly if you want a pattern where

[02:26:56 - 02:27:06]
you want Chad to act as a person where

[02:27:01 - 02:27:08]
or you want to give a idea to Chad GB

[02:27:06 - 02:27:11]
what audience you catering to or you're

[02:27:08 - 02:27:14]
doing visualization or you're doing data

[02:27:11 - 02:27:17]
analysis what is your pattern if you are

[02:27:14 - 02:27:18]
doing a task which contains subtasks or

[02:27:17 - 02:27:21]
sub

[02:27:18 - 02:27:23]
steps what is the pattern you follow and

[02:27:21 - 02:27:25]
if you have a template in mind how you

[02:27:23 - 02:27:27]
want your output to be generated then

[02:27:25 - 02:27:30]
you have template pattern so all these

[02:27:27 - 02:27:34]
five patterns you can keep in mind along

[02:27:30 - 02:27:38]
with your checklist while designing your

[02:27:34 - 02:27:43]
prompts let's now see common prompting

[02:27:38 - 02:27:47]
errors so vake or ambiguous prompts when

[02:27:43 - 02:27:50]
you just write what is joints what is

[02:27:47 - 02:27:52]
prompt engineering that is your vague

[02:27:50 - 02:27:56]
ambiguous prompts where you do not have

[02:27:52 - 02:27:57]
any context instruction what to do just

[02:27:56 - 02:28:00]
vague

[02:27:57 - 02:28:04]
prompts then there are biased prompts

[02:28:00 - 02:28:07]
where you are designing the prompts

[02:28:04 - 02:28:09]
supposing you have two categories and

[02:28:07 - 02:28:10]
the data or the instructions that you

[02:28:09 - 02:28:15]
are providing the examples you are

[02:28:10 - 02:28:18]
providing is leaning towards one and now

[02:28:15 - 02:28:21]
the second category is left alone that

[02:28:18 - 02:28:25]
is your biased prompts

[02:28:21 - 02:28:28]
third is lack of contextual information

[02:28:25 - 02:28:30]
you have just said okay generate the

[02:28:28 - 02:28:32]
content uh

[02:28:30 - 02:28:36]
for

[02:28:32 - 02:28:39]
fractions but what is the target

[02:28:36 - 02:28:42]
audience that you are uh acting are you

[02:28:39 - 02:28:45]
a teacher that you are teaching is there

[02:28:42 - 02:28:47]
any template is there any flow that you

[02:28:45 - 02:28:51]
want to follow are you looking at

[02:28:47 - 02:28:54]
creating a course are you looking as at

[02:28:51 - 02:28:59]
teaching uh fractions as a uh slide you

[02:28:54 - 02:29:02]
want or as paragraph you want anything

[02:28:59 - 02:29:06]
any contextual information is

[02:29:02 - 02:29:10]
missing then you have insufficient

[02:29:06 - 02:29:13]
examples you do not have examples for

[02:29:10 - 02:29:18]
example you just saying generate

[02:29:13 - 02:29:20]
synthetic data for doing sentiment

[02:29:18 - 02:29:22]
analysis but

[02:29:20 - 02:29:25]
what

[02:29:22 - 02:29:28]
on you need to provide some content some

[02:29:25 - 02:29:32]
information that okay this is my data

[02:29:28 - 02:29:35]
now based on this you generate synthetic

[02:29:32 - 02:29:40]
data in a CSV format for me to do

[02:29:35 - 02:29:43]
sentiment analysis that is lacking your

[02:29:40 - 02:29:47]
training data or examples insufficient

[02:29:43 - 02:29:50]
examples then there is complex or

[02:29:47 - 02:29:53]
confusing prompts if you write full

[02:29:50 - 02:29:56]
lengthy prompts but it is very complex

[02:29:53 - 02:29:57]
it has several different informations

[02:29:56 - 02:29:59]
such

[02:29:57 - 02:30:01]
as you have Target information also you

[02:29:59 - 02:30:03]
are acting as a uh target audience

[02:30:01 - 02:30:06]
information you are acting as a uh

[02:30:03 - 02:30:08]
analyst and you have target audience you

[02:30:06 - 02:30:10]
have branding also you have campaigning

[02:30:08 - 02:30:14]
also in that it is very confusing for

[02:30:10 - 02:30:18]
chat GPT to pick one Persona and

[02:30:14 - 02:30:21]
act or for example you are designing a

[02:30:18 - 02:30:23]
campaign but you have given a lot of

[02:30:21 - 02:30:27]
information you

[02:30:23 - 02:30:31]
know check out uh Coca-Cola uh campaign

[02:30:27 - 02:30:33]
that happened at this year or check out

[02:30:31 - 02:30:35]
this campaign and design my campaign it

[02:30:33 - 02:30:38]
is confusing when you give different

[02:30:35 - 02:30:42]
reference points you need to be very

[02:30:38 - 02:30:45]
clear you need to be less complex your

[02:30:42 - 02:30:48]
prompt needs to be very

[02:30:45 - 02:30:51]
simplified so that chat GP can

[02:30:48 - 02:30:54]
understand last last is not testing

[02:30:51 - 02:30:56]
prompts thoroughly you have given a very

[02:30:54 - 02:30:58]
good prompt you have designed a very

[02:30:56 - 02:31:02]
good prompt and given to chart GPT it

[02:30:58 - 02:31:05]
generates something but you are not

[02:31:02 - 02:31:06]
reading it you are blindly following

[02:31:05 - 02:31:09]
what it

[02:31:06 - 02:31:11]
generates you're not giving it a

[02:31:09 - 02:31:16]
feedback you are not asking what it has

[02:31:11 - 02:31:18]
understood from your uh designed

[02:31:16 - 02:31:22]
prompt that is not testing prompt

[02:31:18 - 02:31:25]
thoroughly and you will have less

[02:31:22 - 02:31:28]
accurate uh responses and in some cases

[02:31:25 - 02:31:31]
wrong responses now let's see what are

[02:31:28 - 02:31:33]
the applications different applications

[02:31:31 - 02:31:37]
of prompt

[02:31:33 - 02:31:40]
engineering one is content generation

[02:31:37 - 02:31:43]
you want copywriting advertising

[02:31:40 - 02:31:46]
creative writing educational content you

[02:31:43 - 02:31:48]
can do anything and everything under

[02:31:46 - 02:31:53]
content generation based on your target

[02:31:48 - 02:31:57]
audience based B on who you are catering

[02:31:53 - 02:32:00]
to next is customer support and

[02:31:57 - 02:32:04]
engagement there are various chat bards

[02:32:00 - 02:32:07]
and virtual assistants that can use

[02:32:04 - 02:32:10]
generative models and instructional

[02:32:07 - 02:32:15]
guides as well so that your customer is

[02:32:10 - 02:32:19]
engaged you do not need human as

[02:32:15 - 02:32:21]
resources to reply to your customers

[02:32:19 - 02:32:25]
there are generative models that can

[02:32:21 - 02:32:30]
help you with act as a human and reply

[02:32:25 - 02:32:30]
to your customers at all times

[02:32:30 - 02:32:37]
24/7 then there is data analysis and

[02:32:34 - 02:32:40]
science data cleaning data preparation

[02:32:37 - 02:32:44]
visualization as we talked about

[02:32:40 - 02:32:48]
whatever you want to do you can give an

[02:32:44 - 02:32:50]
input as your data there would be a size

[02:32:48 - 02:32:54]
limit you give and you take tell to

[02:32:50 - 02:32:55]
clean you generate the code you can ask

[02:32:54 - 02:32:58]
what to do when you are doing

[02:32:55 - 02:33:01]
statistical analysis on this kind of

[02:32:58 - 02:33:04]
data what tests uh hypothesis testing to

[02:33:01 - 02:33:06]
do so all these come under data analysis

[02:33:04 - 02:33:09]
and data

[02:33:06 - 02:33:11]
science then application comes under

[02:33:09 - 02:33:14]
code generation and software development

[02:33:11 - 02:33:17]
that is automating your code writing

[02:33:14 - 02:33:21]
debugging document generation

[02:33:17 - 02:33:25]
documentation so all the is using chat

[02:33:21 - 02:33:27]
GPT or generative models you can they

[02:33:25 - 02:33:29]
can make your life easy they can

[02:33:27 - 02:33:31]
generate a code for you whatever you are

[02:33:29 - 02:33:34]
looking at but you have to be very

[02:33:31 - 02:33:35]
specific you have to be very clear what

[02:33:34 - 02:33:39]
you

[02:33:35 - 02:33:42]
want so that your output your response

[02:33:39 - 02:33:45]
from chat GPT your generative models are

[02:33:42 - 02:33:48]
customized based on your

[02:33:45 - 02:33:50]
prompts next is research and information

[02:33:48 - 02:33:53]
retrieval like for examp example text

[02:33:50 - 02:33:56]
summarization question answering

[02:33:53 - 02:33:58]
anything and everything you can give

[02:33:56 - 02:34:02]
links as

[02:33:58 - 02:34:03]
a context and tell that okay these are

[02:34:02 - 02:34:07]
the specific researches done in this

[02:34:03 - 02:34:10]
field based on this give me your

[02:34:07 - 02:34:13]
hypothesis what next can be done for

[02:34:10 - 02:34:14]
example next is machine translation

[02:34:13 - 02:34:17]
information sharing internal

[02:34:14 - 02:34:18]
communication anything related to

[02:34:17 - 02:34:22]
machine

[02:34:18 - 02:34:24]
translation then sentiment analysis

[02:34:22 - 02:34:26]
consumer feedback analysis brand

[02:34:24 - 02:34:30]
management marketing all these things

[02:34:26 - 02:34:33]
using sentiment analysis can be done and

[02:34:30 - 02:34:36]
prompt engineering is used to create

[02:34:33 - 02:34:36]
tools for

[02:34:36 - 02:34:42]
this other domains include Healthcare

[02:34:41 - 02:34:45]
where you can do diagnosis you can

[02:34:42 - 02:34:49]
create a system using generative model

[02:34:45 - 02:34:53]
to diagnosis for a disease and you can

[02:34:49 - 02:34:55]
prompt design prompts that okay my

[02:34:53 - 02:34:58]
patient is this it has a history of this

[02:34:55 - 02:35:00]
now these are the symptoms what is your

[02:34:58 - 02:35:02]
diagnosis

[02:35:00 - 02:35:05]
Manufacturing in manufacturing if you

[02:35:02 - 02:35:07]
want to supply your manufacturing and

[02:35:05 - 02:35:11]
your suppliers you create an llm you

[02:35:07 - 02:35:13]
create generative model where your users

[02:35:11 - 02:35:15]
your employees can ask if I'm

[02:35:13 - 02:35:18]
manufacturing this if I have to

[02:35:15 - 02:35:22]
transport here what to do what not to do

[02:35:18 - 02:35:25]
everything the mesh the network that you

[02:35:22 - 02:35:28]
have in manufacturing industry it can

[02:35:25 - 02:35:31]
intake and give you output results based

[02:35:28 - 02:35:35]
on your prompts then comes

[02:35:31 - 02:35:38]
security security there are attacks they

[02:35:35 - 02:35:42]
can be a lot of AI tools that can be

[02:35:38 - 02:35:44]
used to prevent those attacks to prevent

[02:35:42 - 02:35:47]
your systems you know without

[02:35:44 - 02:35:49]
failing last is retail and shopping that

[02:35:47 - 02:35:52]
is e-commerce

[02:35:49 - 02:35:55]
in your OT platforms or shopping

[02:35:52 - 02:35:57]
e-commerce mintra different websites

[02:35:55 - 02:36:01]
Amazon they can

[02:35:57 - 02:36:03]
use generative models to intake all

[02:36:01 - 02:36:05]
these things and you prompt that okay I

[02:36:03 - 02:36:06]
want this and it helps you with retail

[02:36:05 - 02:36:09]
and

[02:36:06 - 02:36:11]
shopping so these are the various

[02:36:09 - 02:36:15]
applications for prompt

[02:36:11 - 02:36:18]
engineering now let's write a few

[02:36:15 - 02:36:22]
prompts so that you can understand what

[02:36:18 - 02:36:26]
are prompts how to write them so we are

[02:36:22 - 02:36:28]
on a prompt engineering course where you

[02:36:26 - 02:36:31]
understanding the outcome of this course

[02:36:28 - 02:36:34]
is for you to understand what is prompt

[02:36:31 - 02:36:39]
engineering how to write a good prompt

[02:36:34 - 02:36:42]
right so let's give chat GPT a simple

[02:36:39 - 02:36:46]
prompt that is what is prompt

[02:36:42 - 02:36:50]
engineering and let's see what it tells

[02:36:46 - 02:36:54]
us it starts generating and it tells you

[02:36:50 - 02:36:58]
what prompt engineering refers to what

[02:36:54 - 02:37:00]
is crafting and refinement of prompts

[02:36:58 - 02:37:04]
and generates responses from AI language

[02:37:00 - 02:37:06]
models such as GPT then it's saying that

[02:37:04 - 02:37:09]
prompt engineering involves considering

[02:37:06 - 02:37:12]
various factors such as language used in

[02:37:09 - 02:37:14]
promt structure of prompt context

[02:37:12 - 02:37:16]
effective prompt engineering can

[02:37:14 - 02:37:20]
significantly improve performance and

[02:37:16 - 02:37:22]
usefulness of a AI model models in

[02:37:20 - 02:37:25]
various domains such as including

[02:37:22 - 02:37:28]
natural language understanding text

[02:37:25 - 02:37:31]
generation dialogue systems Etc if you

[02:37:28 - 02:37:36]
see this is a query that you have put

[02:37:31 - 02:37:40]
which you can also put on Google and get

[02:37:36 - 02:37:43]
different links not a text not a

[02:37:40 - 02:37:46]
paragraph but different links where you

[02:37:43 - 02:37:48]
can open the links and read it here on

[02:37:46 - 02:37:53]
chat GPT when you enter what is prompt

[02:37:48 - 02:37:57]
engineering you get this a definition a

[02:37:53 - 02:37:59]
elaborated explanation of what the

[02:37:57 - 02:38:03]
generative model that is chat

[02:37:59 - 02:38:05]
GPT that uses GPT as a generative model

[02:38:03 - 02:38:08]
understands about prompt engineering and

[02:38:05 - 02:38:11]
it tells you their perspective of it

[02:38:08 - 02:38:12]
based on the different parameters that

[02:38:11 - 02:38:17]
it is trained

[02:38:12 - 02:38:22]
on now let's see another

[02:38:17 - 02:38:22]
example suppose I want to

[02:38:23 - 02:38:28]
travel 5

[02:38:25 - 02:38:31]
days in

[02:38:28 - 02:38:34]
India please make

[02:38:31 - 02:38:34]
me

[02:38:37 - 02:38:43]
itinary I give this a

[02:38:41 - 02:38:45]
prompt according

[02:38:43 - 02:38:51]
to chat

[02:38:45 - 02:38:51]
gbt understanding it'll give me this

[02:38:52 - 02:38:58]
arrival in Delhi I have not said that

[02:38:55 - 02:39:02]
where I'm arriving from it assumed

[02:38:58 - 02:39:05]
arrival in Delhi day two Delhi to Agra

[02:39:02 - 02:39:09]
day three Agra to jaur day four jaur

[02:39:05 - 02:39:10]
sightseing day five jaur to Delhi and it

[02:39:09 - 02:39:14]
tells

[02:39:10 - 02:39:16]
me when you are in that day you arrive

[02:39:14 - 02:39:21]
in Delhi for example it is capital of

[02:39:16 - 02:39:25]
India visit historic landmarks like red

[02:39:21 - 02:39:30]
Fort explore bustling streets of old

[02:39:25 - 02:39:35]
Delhi experience optional visit is hu's

[02:39:30 - 02:39:36]
Tomb or Kum Minar okay again day two

[02:39:35 - 02:39:38]
it's giving

[02:39:36 - 02:39:42]
different or day three it is giving

[02:39:38 - 02:39:45]
different options I have not said here

[02:39:42 - 02:39:49]
what I like I have not said whether I am

[02:39:45 - 02:39:52]
a beach person or a mountain person or a

[02:39:49 - 02:39:55]
normal uh I want to travel uh which kind

[02:39:52 - 02:39:58]
of places hot cold nothing it has not

[02:39:55 - 02:40:03]
asked also this is my random prompt that

[02:39:58 - 02:40:05]
I have given chat GPT now let's see a

[02:40:03 - 02:40:07]
different kind of example I have a

[02:40:05 - 02:40:10]
passage of three four sentences I want

[02:40:07 - 02:40:13]
to summarize in one sentence right I am

[02:40:10 - 02:40:16]
giving an example that my example text

[02:40:13 - 02:40:20]
is scientists have discovered a new

[02:40:16 - 02:40:23]
species of orchid in rainforest of South

[02:40:20 - 02:40:27]
America and the output that I'm giving

[02:40:23 - 02:40:33]
is a new species the entire sentence

[02:40:27 - 02:40:36]
okay now my sentence or my passage is on

[02:40:33 - 02:40:39]
prompt engineering and involves crafting

[02:40:36 - 02:40:41]
precise contest Specific Instructions

[02:40:39 - 02:40:44]
and queries and these prompts provide

[02:40:41 - 02:40:47]
guidance we can enhance model

[02:40:44 - 02:40:50]
performance achieve better control over

[02:40:47 - 02:40:52]
generated output and address limitations

[02:40:50 - 02:40:56]
associated with open-ended language

[02:40:52 - 02:40:59]
generation and I want to summarize this

[02:40:56 - 02:41:00]
into one or two sentences right this is

[02:40:59 - 02:41:05]
my

[02:41:00 - 02:41:08]
prompt I give this and this is what it

[02:41:05 - 02:41:14]
gives me however this is isn't it

[02:41:08 - 02:41:19]
feeling as same now if I say please

[02:41:14 - 02:41:22]
shorten this further for example

[02:41:19 - 02:41:27]
I don't want this much I want short and

[02:41:22 - 02:41:30]
crisp it still gives me this again I say

[02:41:27 - 02:41:30]
B please

[02:41:31 - 02:41:34]
be

[02:41:36 - 02:41:41]
concise now it gives me prompt

[02:41:38 - 02:41:44]
engineering uses precise prompts to

[02:41:41 - 02:41:48]
guide language models improving

[02:41:44 - 02:41:50]
performance control and overcoming

[02:41:48 - 02:41:53]
limitations in gener ating responses

[02:41:50 - 02:41:56]
however the first one when I asked

[02:41:53 - 02:41:58]
please shorten this further it said

[02:41:56 - 02:42:00]
crafting precise instructions called

[02:41:58 - 02:42:04]
prompts to guide language models and

[02:42:00 - 02:42:06]
shape their output it enhances model

[02:42:04 - 02:42:09]
performance offers better control over

[02:42:06 - 02:42:14]
generated uh responses and addresses

[02:42:09 - 02:42:18]
limitations of open-ended language

[02:42:14 - 02:42:22]
generation if you compare this output

[02:42:18 - 02:42:26]
with this out put some information is

[02:42:22 - 02:42:30]
lost some information is retained while

[02:42:26 - 02:42:33]
making it conscise so you have to see

[02:42:30 - 02:42:36]
what responses you are getting based on

[02:42:33 - 02:42:38]
your prompts and give them a feedback

[02:42:36 - 02:42:42]
what you want to

[02:42:38 - 02:42:45]
do so these are some examples of

[02:42:42 - 02:42:47]
prompts this is the first uh time you're

[02:42:45 - 02:42:51]
looking at prompts in this

[02:42:47 - 02:42:55]
course so we try to cover from

[02:42:51 - 02:42:57]
basic content generation basic query

[02:42:55 - 02:43:00]
based uh prompts

[02:42:57 - 02:43:03]
to traveling itary without any

[02:43:00 - 02:43:05]
information to Tex summarization where

[02:43:03 - 02:43:09]
you are given an example and asking to

[02:43:05 - 02:43:13]
summarize and giving chat GPT a feedback

[02:43:09 - 02:43:17]
on it right so this is your first prompt

[02:43:13 - 02:43:20]
now let's see different components and

[02:43:17 - 02:43:24]
further analyze what is a good

[02:43:20 - 02:43:27]
prompt now let's look at few examples so

[02:43:24 - 02:43:31]
that we can analyze what are good Proms

[02:43:27 - 02:43:34]
and the checklist that we have seen the

[02:43:31 - 02:43:37]
pattern Persona patterns we have seen

[02:43:34 - 02:43:39]
the components that we have seen how to

[02:43:37 - 02:43:42]
integrate that while designing your

[02:43:39 - 02:43:45]
prompts now let's see how we have

[02:43:42 - 02:43:47]
designed this prompt and what all

[02:43:45 - 02:43:50]
components we have

[02:43:47 - 02:43:52]
included in content

[02:43:50 - 02:43:55]
generation where where we have written

[02:43:52 - 02:43:59]
provide a comprehensive overview of tech

[02:43:55 - 02:44:01]
summarization which is our main topic or

[02:43:59 - 02:44:05]
concept that we want to understand

[02:44:01 - 02:44:08]
empowering Learners to grasp its

[02:44:05 - 02:44:10]
significance and potential applications

[02:44:08 - 02:44:13]
across diverse

[02:44:10 - 02:44:17]
domains so basically with this line we

[02:44:13 - 02:44:19]
are telling that we want our Learners to

[02:44:17 - 02:44:22]
grasp what is

[02:44:19 - 02:44:25]
summerization for different domains it

[02:44:22 - 02:44:27]
can be for manufacturing domain it can

[02:44:25 - 02:44:30]
be healthc care but what is Tech

[02:44:27 - 02:44:33]
summarization we want our Learners to

[02:44:30 - 02:44:35]
understand that now we have given some

[02:44:33 - 02:44:38]
guidelines also here you need to follow

[02:44:35 - 02:44:42]
below guidelines while answering we are

[02:44:38 - 02:44:46]
telling chart GPT provide an insight

[02:44:42 - 02:44:49]
into Tech summarization a tool for

[02:44:46 - 02:44:52]
condensing lengthy text into short

[02:44:49 - 02:44:56]
shorter and more manageable versions

[02:44:52 - 02:44:59]
second we say explore various techniques

[02:44:56 - 02:45:01]
like extraction abstraction used to

[02:44:59 - 02:45:02]
achieve this and provide Clarity on how

[02:45:01 - 02:45:05]
it

[02:45:02 - 02:45:08]
works third we are saying provide

[02:45:05 - 02:45:11]
relevant examples of different domains

[02:45:08 - 02:45:13]
and use cases where this text

[02:45:11 - 02:45:17]
summarization can be

[02:45:13 - 02:45:20]
applied fourth is explain te teex

[02:45:17 - 02:45:23]
summarization how it is evolving and

[02:45:20 - 02:45:25]
innovating with advancement in Ai and

[02:45:23 - 02:45:29]
machine learning offering customized

[02:45:25 - 02:45:32]
solutions for diverse needs we are also

[02:45:29 - 02:45:35]
giving extra instructions also that

[02:45:32 - 02:45:38]
while providing insights the Learners

[02:45:35 - 02:45:40]
are from different domains and have just

[02:45:38 - 02:45:42]
the

[02:45:40 - 02:45:46]
preliminary knowledge of tech

[02:45:42 - 02:45:47]
summarization cover the basics so for

[02:45:46 - 02:45:50]
that you cover the basics of text

[02:45:47 - 02:45:53]
summarization techniques highlight key

[02:45:50 - 02:45:56]
Concepts without diving into overly

[02:45:53 - 02:45:59]
technical details what not to do we have

[02:45:56 - 02:46:02]
also specify this approach will cater to

[02:45:59 - 02:46:04]
our audience's level with familiarity of

[02:46:02 - 02:46:07]
the topic we can tell the level also

[02:46:04 - 02:46:10]
here but let's see how it

[02:46:07 - 02:46:13]
responds give explanation in clear

[02:46:10 - 02:46:16]
straight forward American English we are

[02:46:13 - 02:46:20]
telling the scope also we are telling

[02:46:16 - 02:46:22]
the communication style also

[02:46:20 - 02:46:24]
ensuring the accessibility and

[02:46:22 - 02:46:25]
understanding maintain a clear and

[02:46:24 - 02:46:29]
straightforward

[02:46:25 - 02:46:32]
tone ensuring accessibility and ease of

[02:46:29 - 02:46:36]
understanding for all Learners now let's

[02:46:32 - 02:46:39]
give this prompt to chat gbt and see how

[02:46:36 - 02:46:39]
it

[02:46:43 - 02:46:47]
responds

[02:46:44 - 02:46:51]
so it gives text summarization is a

[02:46:47 - 02:46:53]
powerful tool used to condense lengthy

[02:46:51 - 02:46:55]
text into shorter more manageable

[02:46:53 - 02:46:58]
versions it's basically taken what we

[02:46:55 - 02:47:00]
have provided and given as a definition

[02:46:58 - 02:47:03]
making it easier for leaders to grasp

[02:47:00 - 02:47:06]
main points without going through entire

[02:47:03 - 02:47:09]
document now this is now breaking our

[02:47:06 - 02:47:13]
key con uh aspects into better

[02:47:09 - 02:47:16]
understanding insights into Tex

[02:47:13 - 02:47:18]
summarization where it tells that it can

[02:47:16 - 02:47:21]
be thought of a process similar to what

[02:47:18 - 02:47:22]
humans naturally do when they summarize

[02:47:21 - 02:47:25]
an

[02:47:22 - 02:47:28]
article a book or a conversation the

[02:47:25 - 02:47:30]
goal is to extract the most important

[02:47:28 - 02:47:32]
information and present in the concise

[02:47:30 - 02:47:36]
form that's okay that is the Insight

[02:47:32 - 02:47:39]
that it is giving now we also

[02:47:36 - 02:47:41]
highlighted that please ensure that you

[02:47:39 - 02:47:45]
are using extraction and abstraction

[02:47:41 - 02:47:49]
also to explain text

[02:47:45 - 02:47:52]
summarization and along with that use

[02:47:49 - 02:47:54]
examples in use cases also where it is

[02:47:52 - 02:47:57]
highlighting what are the

[02:47:54 - 02:47:59]
applications in various domains in news

[02:47:57 - 02:48:02]
aggregation academic

[02:47:59 - 02:48:04]
research legal documents that is

[02:48:02 - 02:48:07]
your

[02:48:04 - 02:48:10]
law in branding social

[02:48:07 - 02:48:12]
media in customer feedback analysis

[02:48:10 - 02:48:16]
which different companies

[02:48:12 - 02:48:19]
uses then it is giving the evolution and

[02:48:16 - 02:48:21]
advancements with time what has done

[02:48:19 - 02:48:23]
customized

[02:48:21 - 02:48:26]
summaries multimodel

[02:48:23 - 02:48:29]
summarization realtime summarization

[02:48:26 - 02:48:34]
evaluation Matrix various things that

[02:48:29 - 02:48:37]
has evolved in text summarization now if

[02:48:34 - 02:48:39]
you want more insights on Tech

[02:48:37 - 02:48:42]
summarization where you want different

[02:48:39 - 02:48:44]
techniques for it to explain different

[02:48:42 - 02:48:47]
techniques you need to tell please

[02:48:44 - 02:48:50]
explain further more or elaborate

[02:48:47 - 02:48:53]
further more on techniques used on

[02:48:50 - 02:48:54]
extraction or abstraction or give me

[02:48:53 - 02:48:57]
more

[02:48:54 - 02:49:00]
examples not application examples so if

[02:48:57 - 02:49:02]
you see here it has given use cases the

[02:49:00 - 02:49:06]
applications across it has not given

[02:49:02 - 02:49:10]
examples so you can say this is my

[02:49:06 - 02:49:12]
feedback to you that the explanation

[02:49:10 - 02:49:16]
that you have generated is missing

[02:49:12 - 02:49:19]
example I'm not able to correlate what

[02:49:16 - 02:49:22]
is given here what you you have

[02:49:19 - 02:49:24]
generated here right so you can tell the

[02:49:22 - 02:49:27]
examples are missing you can also tell

[02:49:24 - 02:49:29]
that Evolution and advancements does not

[02:49:27 - 02:49:32]
tell me when it started does not tell me

[02:49:29 - 02:49:35]
a history Evolution means history it is

[02:49:32 - 02:49:39]
not telling me that so all these are

[02:49:35 - 02:49:43]
your feedbacks so that you can have a

[02:49:39 - 02:49:46]
output you can have a response a final

[02:49:43 - 02:49:48]
response that gives you what is Tech

[02:49:46 - 02:49:50]
summarization what is the significance

[02:49:48 - 02:49:53]
of Tech summarization what are different

[02:49:50 - 02:49:54]
techniques of tech summarization what

[02:49:53 - 02:49:57]
are the different examples of tech

[02:49:54 - 02:50:00]
summarization what are the applications

[02:49:57 - 02:50:02]
how it evolved when it started what are

[02:50:00 - 02:50:06]
the different things what are the

[02:50:02 - 02:50:11]
different advancements in using AI now

[02:50:06 - 02:50:14]
so you can definitely work further more

[02:50:11 - 02:50:20]
now this was chat GPT

[02:50:14 - 02:50:24]
3.5 let's now see in chat G gbt 4 we

[02:50:20 - 02:50:27]
create a new chat and give the

[02:50:24 - 02:50:30]
same prompt to chat gbt 4 also and see

[02:50:27 - 02:50:32]
how it responds what is the difference

[02:50:30 - 02:50:35]
between four and

[02:50:32 - 02:50:38]
three we have given the same prompt not

[02:50:35 - 02:50:43]
changed a single line

[02:50:38 - 02:50:45]
here so it has generated an output where

[02:50:43 - 02:50:48]
it generates a

[02:50:45 - 02:50:50]
content on text summarization if and if

[02:50:48 - 02:50:54]
if you note the first

[02:50:50 - 02:50:56]
line it has not taken the same thing

[02:50:54 - 02:51:01]
that we have given as prompt it has

[02:50:56 - 02:51:03]
written and explained in its different

[02:51:01 - 02:51:06]
words or different explanation what is

[02:51:03 - 02:51:07]
text summarization which is a powerful

[02:51:06 - 02:51:10]
tool in the field of natural language

[02:51:07 - 02:51:14]
processing designed to condense long

[02:51:10 - 02:51:17]
pieces of text into shorter concise

[02:51:14 - 02:51:19]
summaries now it tells you the

[02:51:17 - 02:51:21]
techniques of text summarization which

[02:51:19 - 02:51:25]
is abstraction and

[02:51:21 - 02:51:28]
extraction with tools and various

[02:51:25 - 02:51:31]
examples of it various applications of

[02:51:28 - 02:51:34]
it now it tells you applications across

[02:51:31 - 02:51:37]
various domains as well which is closely

[02:51:34 - 02:51:40]
the same as 3.5 again this is also

[02:51:37 - 02:51:45]
missing your examples it has not given

[02:51:40 - 02:51:49]
you any example in evolution if you see

[02:51:45 - 02:51:53]
it has given how it has evolved you can

[02:51:49 - 02:51:57]
also give a feedback to chat gp4 that I

[02:51:53 - 02:52:00]
want a timeline Evolution for Tech

[02:51:57 - 02:52:04]
summarization and it has briefly

[02:52:00 - 02:52:06]
explained some advancement again as

[02:52:04 - 02:52:09]
compared to 3.5 that is missing which

[02:52:06 - 02:52:13]
you can give as a feedback and it can

[02:52:09 - 02:52:16]
improve upon so this is what code

[02:52:13 - 02:52:21]
content generation example was in both

[02:52:16 - 02:52:24]
chat gbt 3.5 and chat aity 4 now let's

[02:52:21 - 02:52:26]
see a different example that is Tex

[02:52:24 - 02:52:28]
summarization we learned about Tex

[02:52:26 - 02:52:31]
summarization now you have fairly a good

[02:52:28 - 02:52:33]
idea what is teex summarization you give

[02:52:31 - 02:52:36]
what you want to understand and it

[02:52:33 - 02:52:39]
summarizes and gives you output

[02:52:36 - 02:52:44]
summaries basically of what you provide

[02:52:39 - 02:52:50]
now let's provide chart GPT an article

[02:52:44 - 02:52:50]
and ask it to summarize it

[02:52:50 - 02:52:55]
so we have the tech

[02:52:52 - 02:52:59]
summarization example here where we are

[02:52:55 - 02:53:01]
given an article on Indian Express based

[02:52:59 - 02:53:06]
on

[02:53:01 - 02:53:09]
Tesla policy and we have asked that use

[02:53:06 - 02:53:13]
pinto pyramid principle and we have

[02:53:09 - 02:53:15]
given the link also to that to structure

[02:53:13 - 02:53:18]
your communication from top down

[02:53:15 - 02:53:19]
ensuring Swift and clear message

[02:53:18 - 02:53:23]
delivery

[02:53:19 - 02:53:26]
start with the conclusion follow with

[02:53:23 - 02:53:29]
key arguments and then support with

[02:53:26 - 02:53:32]
detailed information give only relevant

[02:53:29 - 02:53:36]
information that is appropriate to

[02:53:32 - 02:53:39]
understand business outcomes

[02:53:36 - 02:53:42]
only use clear and straightforward

[02:53:39 - 02:53:46]
language for better understanding so we

[02:53:42 - 02:53:49]
have given a context an

[02:53:46 - 02:53:51]
instruction we have not not given an

[02:53:49 - 02:53:53]
example here but we have given clear

[02:53:51 - 02:53:56]
instruction and we have

[02:53:53 - 02:54:00]
given restrictions also we have given a

[02:53:56 - 02:54:04]
style also that be straightforward right

[02:54:00 - 02:54:07]
you can further give that okay uh make

[02:54:04 - 02:54:11]
your word limit to this much only okay

[02:54:07 - 02:54:11]
so let's first see what it

[02:54:12 - 02:54:20]
generates so in pinto pyramid principle

[02:54:17 - 02:54:23]
we write a conclusion first then we

[02:54:20 - 02:54:25]
write key argument why we have concluded

[02:54:23 - 02:54:28]
so basically if you are having a

[02:54:25 - 02:54:30]
conversation and you want to conclude

[02:54:28 - 02:54:32]
that conversation you will write that

[02:54:30 - 02:54:34]
conclusion first then you'll write your

[02:54:32 - 02:54:37]
key arguments okay this is why I'm

[02:54:34 - 02:54:39]
telling and then you write the detailed

[02:54:37 - 02:54:42]
information that is related so basically

[02:54:39 - 02:54:46]
we want because we

[02:54:42 - 02:54:48]
are asking for business right business

[02:54:46 - 02:54:51]
needs conclusion first so we have

[02:54:48 - 02:54:54]
concluded this ver that India's decision

[02:54:51 - 02:54:58]
to lower import taxes on eveve could

[02:54:54 - 02:55:01]
potentially pave the way for Tesla LED

[02:54:58 - 02:55:04]
by Elon Musk to enter Indian market now

[02:55:01 - 02:55:07]
key arguments are lowering import uh

[02:55:04 - 02:55:11]
taxes Tesla entry into Indian market

[02:55:07 - 02:55:14]
boost for India's EV industry then we

[02:55:11 - 02:55:18]
have detailed inputs from that report

[02:55:14 - 02:55:21]
only that are mentioned here right so

[02:55:18 - 02:55:24]
this is a text summarization in a

[02:55:21 - 02:55:27]
structured way text summarization can

[02:55:24 - 02:55:29]
also be if you go back in the first

[02:55:27 - 02:55:32]
prompt that you have written where we

[02:55:29 - 02:55:35]
had four five lines and it summarized

[02:55:32 - 02:55:38]
for us that is also text summarization

[02:55:35 - 02:55:40]
this is a structured text summarization

[02:55:38 - 02:55:44]
where you do not need to go through this

[02:55:40 - 02:55:46]
whole article of Indian Express and it

[02:55:44 - 02:55:48]
gave you a conclusion it gave you key

[02:55:46 - 02:55:52]
arguments what it presented in the

[02:55:48 - 02:55:53]
article right so this is an example for

[02:55:52 - 02:55:57]
text

[02:55:53 - 02:56:01]
summarization now let's do an example on

[02:55:57 - 02:56:03]
code generation which mostly from people

[02:56:01 - 02:56:09]
from Tech domain or data domain will use

[02:56:03 - 02:56:13]
charity for right so the prompt has a

[02:56:09 - 02:56:16]
python recursion uh code for

[02:56:13 - 02:56:18]
calculating factorial where we are

[02:56:16 - 02:56:22]
defining a method

[02:56:18 - 02:56:26]
to calculate factorial if n is equal to

[02:56:22 - 02:56:28]
1 equal equal to 1 return n else return

[02:56:26 - 02:56:31]
n into calculate factorial we are doing

[02:56:28 - 02:56:33]
recursively right now the same

[02:56:31 - 02:56:38]
calculating factorial we have done with

[02:56:33 - 02:56:41]
non-tail recursive function right we are

[02:56:38 - 02:56:43]
giving an example on that as well now

[02:56:41 - 02:56:48]
what we want is

[02:56:43 - 02:56:50]
to write a program with recursive

[02:56:48 - 02:56:51]
function function to check if a string

[02:56:50 - 02:56:55]
is

[02:56:51 - 02:56:59]
palindrome in python or not

[02:56:55 - 02:57:01]
right where we have given two examples

[02:56:59 - 02:57:07]
of recursion on factorial and now we are

[02:57:01 - 02:57:07]
asking chat GPT to generate code for

[02:57:11 - 02:57:19]
palandro now this has given that okay

[02:57:16 - 02:57:22]
with comment that this is the base case

[02:57:19 - 02:57:23]
if the length of the string is zero or

[02:57:22 - 02:57:26]
one it's a

[02:57:23 - 02:57:30]
palr compare the first and last

[02:57:26 - 02:57:33]
characters of the string false okay

[02:57:30 - 02:57:37]
return false if it is not equal

[02:57:33 - 02:57:40]
recursive call check if the substring

[02:57:37 - 02:57:44]
excluding the first and last characters

[02:57:40 - 02:57:46]
right so this becomes your output now

[02:57:44 - 02:57:48]
this function works by recursively

[02:57:46 - 02:57:51]
checking if the first and last

[02:57:48 - 02:57:54]
characters of the strings are same okay

[02:57:51 - 02:57:57]
you can also uh in your prompt say uh

[02:57:54 - 02:57:59]
please uh explain line by line as well

[02:57:57 - 02:58:02]
if you want further elaborated

[02:57:59 - 02:58:06]
explanation as well though it has uh

[02:58:02 - 02:58:08]
given comments right you can further ask

[02:58:06 - 02:58:11]
give me further more explanation for

[02:58:08 - 02:58:15]
this now let's see the same thing in

[02:58:11 - 02:58:15]
chat giib 4

[02:58:21 - 02:58:29]
in chart JB 4 it actually has

[02:58:26 - 02:58:34]
explained what is this function what it

[02:58:29 - 02:58:36]
does where Len is equals to 0 A Single

[02:58:34 - 02:58:40]
Character what it will do both cases

[02:58:36 - 02:58:44]
will be true it runs returns true okay

[02:58:40 - 02:58:46]
what is the recursive case first checks

[02:58:44 - 02:58:48]
if the first and last characters of the

[02:58:46 - 02:58:51]
string are same

[02:58:48 - 02:58:53]
calls is palindrome it is telling each

[02:58:51 - 02:58:56]
and everything that the function is

[02:58:53 - 02:59:01]
doing this is equivalent however this is

[02:58:56 - 02:59:04]
a little bit optimized version of 3.5

[02:59:01 - 02:59:09]
now you can see a difference between how

[02:59:04 - 02:59:11]
or what 3.5 generates code for a

[02:59:09 - 02:59:14]
specific problem statement and how four

[02:59:11 - 02:59:17]
generates so basically four is more

[02:59:14 - 02:59:18]
optimized for uh code generation rather

[02:59:17 - 02:59:21]
than

[02:59:18 - 02:59:24]
3.5 in 3.5 you

[02:59:21 - 02:59:26]
can iteratively ask please optimize

[02:59:24 - 02:59:30]
please optimize this please optimize

[02:59:26 - 02:59:32]
this right in four you can do once or

[02:59:30 - 02:59:34]
twice and then actually it will give you

[02:59:32 - 02:59:38]
an optimized version for the same and

[02:59:34 - 02:59:40]
you can write furthermore to uh refine

[02:59:38 - 02:59:43]
your prompt you can write please give me

[02:59:40 - 02:59:45]
the complexity time complexity storage

[02:59:43 - 02:59:49]
complexity for the same space complexity

[02:59:45 - 02:59:51]
for the same right so these are the

[02:59:49 - 02:59:53]
examples for a good prompt where you are

[02:59:51 - 02:59:55]
giving a context where you're giving an

[02:59:53 - 02:59:58]
instruction where you are giving a

[02:59:55 - 03:00:01]
restrictions we are doing where you are

[02:59:58 - 03:00:03]
following items from your checklist

[03:00:01 - 03:00:06]
where you are following a pattern uh to

[03:00:03 - 03:00:10]
provide a pattern to your uh chat GPT as

[03:00:06 - 03:00:12]
well so these are some of the examples

[03:00:10 - 03:00:16]
that you can refine more you can

[03:00:12 - 03:00:19]
experiment more with Advanced prompt

[03:00:16 - 03:00:21]
strategies

[03:00:19 - 03:00:25]
these are different

[03:00:21 - 03:00:29]
prompts or different types of prompts

[03:00:25 - 03:00:34]
that exists we are taking only

[03:00:29 - 03:00:37]
three types zero short few short chain

[03:00:34 - 03:00:40]
of thought process that's it there are

[03:00:37 - 03:00:44]
several different more strategies that

[03:00:40 - 03:00:46]
exists like self-consistency

[03:00:44 - 03:00:49]
tree of

[03:00:46 - 03:00:53]
thought respond

[03:00:49 - 03:00:57]
rephrase Etc you can go and look dive

[03:00:53 - 03:01:01]
deeper into the same let's not see what

[03:00:57 - 03:01:04]
is zero shot zero shot is directly

[03:01:01 - 03:01:08]
instructing your model that is chat GPT

[03:01:04 - 03:01:13]
to perform a task without any additional

[03:01:08 - 03:01:13]
examples for example I just say

[03:01:13 - 03:01:22]
classify my feedback into neutral

[03:01:17 - 03:01:26]
positive and negative and I give us

[03:01:22 - 03:01:27]
line that is the input and it outputs

[03:01:26 - 03:01:30]
the

[03:01:27 - 03:01:34]
sentiment that's it this is my zero shot

[03:01:30 - 03:01:38]
few short is teaching with examples that

[03:01:34 - 03:01:43]
we saw previously where we gave two

[03:01:38 - 03:01:45]
examples and third is our input where we

[03:01:43 - 03:01:50]
are indicating how we want the output

[03:01:45 - 03:01:53]
and it gives the out output for the same

[03:01:50 - 03:01:55]
so that is few short zero short is

[03:01:53 - 03:01:59]
without any

[03:01:55 - 03:02:01]
example any prompt without any example

[03:01:59 - 03:02:05]
where you are only telling the

[03:02:01 - 03:02:07]
instruction that's it no context F short

[03:02:05 - 03:02:10]
is giving

[03:02:07 - 03:02:12]
examples for chat GPT to learn and

[03:02:10 - 03:02:15]
produce your

[03:02:12 - 03:02:20]
response now Chain of Thought Chain of

[03:02:15 - 03:02:25]
Thought is designed for logical

[03:02:20 - 03:02:28]
tasks anything logical it is the best

[03:02:25 - 03:02:32]
prompt strategy to

[03:02:28 - 03:02:34]
follow you give in Chain of

[03:02:32 - 03:02:38]
Thought an

[03:02:34 - 03:02:39]
example how to do a process for example

[03:02:38 - 03:02:42]
you

[03:02:39 - 03:02:45]
are

[03:02:42 - 03:02:51]
adding you are given an example 2 + 2 is

[03:02:45 - 03:02:54]
equal to 4 then you say 15 + 4 = 19 then

[03:02:51 - 03:02:54]
you give an

[03:02:55 - 03:03:00]
input okay I want

[03:03:00 - 03:03:05]
3,150

[03:03:02 - 03:03:05]
+

[03:03:06 - 03:03:12]
10,500 what will be my answer you're

[03:03:09 - 03:03:15]
telling how to do the process and then

[03:03:12 - 03:03:18]
you are asking in your input what will

[03:03:15 - 03:03:22]
be the output

[03:03:18 - 03:03:26]
this is very basic there are complex

[03:03:22 - 03:03:30]
problems for example blood relations X

[03:03:26 - 03:03:34]
is related to Y so what will be the

[03:03:30 - 03:03:38]
relation for Zed with

[03:03:34 - 03:03:42]
X so all these logical questions all

[03:03:38 - 03:03:45]
these logical uh and complex bits is for

[03:03:42 - 03:03:49]
Chain of Thought now let's

[03:03:45 - 03:03:52]
see examples of these three prompt

[03:03:49 - 03:03:55]
strategies on chart GPT so that you

[03:03:52 - 03:03:59]
understand it better how to work with

[03:03:55 - 03:04:03]
these on actual playground let's now see

[03:03:59 - 03:04:06]
few examples on these Advanced prompt

[03:04:03 - 03:04:09]
strategies zero shot few short and Chain

[03:04:06 - 03:04:12]
of Thought now zero shot is giving no

[03:04:09 - 03:04:16]
examples just giving the instruction

[03:04:12 - 03:04:19]
just giving what it needs to do so we'll

[03:04:16 - 03:04:22]
take a simple example very generalized

[03:04:19 - 03:04:24]
example where we are generating a

[03:04:22 - 03:04:29]
passage in the style of William

[03:04:24 - 03:04:29]
Shakespeare okay we are giving this

[03:04:30 - 03:04:39]
prompt based on what chart gbd would

[03:04:35 - 03:04:43]
have been trained on it has given a

[03:04:39 - 03:04:46]
passage from of William Shakespeare

[03:04:43 - 03:04:48]
but from where it is from you can ask

[03:04:46 - 03:04:50]
from where

[03:04:48 - 03:04:53]
this

[03:04:50 - 03:04:53]
passage is

[03:04:56 - 03:05:01]
from the passage I provided is an

[03:04:59 - 03:05:03]
original composition written in the

[03:05:01 - 03:05:07]
style of William Shakespeare while it

[03:05:03 - 03:05:10]
captures the language imaginary and

[03:05:07 - 03:05:13]
themes often found in Shakespearean work

[03:05:10 - 03:05:15]
it is not directly derived from any

[03:05:13 - 03:05:19]
specific

[03:05:15 - 03:05:23]
text by the B do did you want the

[03:05:19 - 03:05:26]
same right you need to give the feedback

[03:05:23 - 03:05:31]
now I did not want in this manner I

[03:05:26 - 03:05:37]
wanted a extract uh from his own plays

[03:05:31 - 03:05:41]
or his own uh poetry and given and as an

[03:05:37 - 03:05:44]
example right or is it following what

[03:05:41 - 03:05:48]
you want right you can give that as a

[03:05:44 - 03:05:51]
feedback as well now this this is zero

[03:05:48 - 03:05:54]
short if we want to make this as a few

[03:05:51 - 03:05:56]
short we need to give an example we have

[03:05:54 - 03:05:58]
given an example generate a passage in

[03:05:56 - 03:06:01]
the style of William Shakespeare example

[03:05:58 - 03:06:04]
is original text to be or not to be that

[03:06:01 - 03:06:09]
is the question Shakespeare in style

[03:06:04 - 03:06:11]
rewrite is whether this nobler in the

[03:06:09 - 03:06:16]
mind to suffer

[03:06:11 - 03:06:18]
the slings and arrows of Outrageous

[03:06:16 - 03:06:21]
Fortune

[03:06:18 - 03:06:23]
similarly in example two we have given

[03:06:21 - 03:06:26]
all the

[03:06:23 - 03:06:32]
worlds is a stage and all the men and

[03:06:26 - 03:06:34]
women merely players right so now we say

[03:06:32 - 03:06:39]
this is few

[03:06:34 - 03:06:41]
shot it has given an example out out

[03:06:39 - 03:06:46]
brief candle

[03:06:41 - 03:06:51]
lives but a walking Shadow a poor player

[03:06:46 - 03:06:55]
that struts and s his R upon the stage

[03:06:51 - 03:06:57]
and then is heard no more right and

[03:06:55 - 03:07:01]
Shakespearean style for

[03:06:57 - 03:07:04]
this so this is an example of zero shot

[03:07:01 - 03:07:08]
and this is an example of few shot

[03:07:04 - 03:07:10]
right let's take another

[03:07:08 - 03:07:14]
example where we

[03:07:10 - 03:07:16]
say charity to translate it's a lot of

[03:07:14 - 03:07:17]
William Shakespeare William Shakespeare

[03:07:16 - 03:07:20]
right let's take a simple MO more

[03:07:17 - 03:07:23]
simpler example where I say translate

[03:07:20 - 03:07:26]
this English sentence to Spanish I am a

[03:07:23 - 03:07:29]
Spanish reader I this is the English

[03:07:26 - 03:07:32]
sentence I want to translate into

[03:07:29 - 03:07:35]
Spanish I say this and it says it gives

[03:07:32 - 03:07:40]
the translation for this now if I want

[03:07:35 - 03:07:43]
to make this few short I'll add examples

[03:07:40 - 03:07:47]
I'll add um more examples for the same

[03:07:43 - 03:07:49]
I'll add uh say that okay this is my

[03:07:47 - 03:07:51]
article I can give an article also and

[03:07:49 - 03:07:53]
say please translate this these are my

[03:07:51 - 03:07:56]
examples now take this article and

[03:07:53 - 03:07:59]
Translate in Spanish for me I can do

[03:07:56 - 03:08:02]
that as well so that becomes few short

[03:07:59 - 03:08:05]
for the same in Charge 4 there is an

[03:08:02 - 03:08:06]
option that we want to highlight is that

[03:08:05 - 03:08:09]
you

[03:08:06 - 03:08:11]
can click on this attachment add any

[03:08:09 - 03:08:16]
attachment it can be data set it can be

[03:08:11 - 03:08:19]
images and train your chat GPT that okay

[03:08:16 - 03:08:21]
for example examp you want to train

[03:08:19 - 03:08:23]
these are the picture of roses where you

[03:08:21 - 03:08:28]
provide different pictures of roses and

[03:08:23 - 03:08:32]
in input as an input data you give Lily

[03:08:28 - 03:08:35]
and you ask what is it is it a rose and

[03:08:32 - 03:08:37]
it tells you based on what images you

[03:08:35 - 03:08:40]
have input is it a rose or not just a

[03:08:37 - 03:08:44]
random example the same can be used for

[03:08:40 - 03:08:47]
data science or data analysis different

[03:08:44 - 03:08:51]
activities visualizations as well where

[03:08:47 - 03:08:54]
you can give the data and ask chart GPT

[03:08:51 - 03:08:58]
to analyze visualize the data and give

[03:08:54 - 03:09:03]
you outputs for the

[03:08:58 - 03:09:05]
same now let's see Chain of Thought

[03:09:03 - 03:09:11]
Chain of Thought is said to be logical

[03:09:05 - 03:09:15]
it works on logical bits right here in

[03:09:11 - 03:09:18]
this prompt example we have designed few

[03:09:15 - 03:09:21]
question and answer that is on blood

[03:09:18 - 03:09:24]
relation where the first question is if

[03:09:21 - 03:09:27]
Michael says Patrick's mother is the

[03:09:24 - 03:09:31]
only daughter of my mother how is

[03:09:27 - 03:09:33]
Michael related to Patrick we are giving

[03:09:31 - 03:09:35]
the answer is Michael is saying that

[03:09:33 - 03:09:38]
Patrick's mother is Michael's own

[03:09:35 - 03:09:41]
Mother's only daughter this means

[03:09:38 - 03:09:45]
Patrick's mother is Michael's sister

[03:09:41 - 03:09:48]
making Michael Patrick's Uncle okay

[03:09:45 - 03:09:51]
second example we have giving Emma is

[03:09:48 - 03:09:54]
John's sister Mark is John's father

[03:09:51 - 03:09:56]
Linda is Mark's sister and Thomas is

[03:09:54 - 03:09:58]
Linda's son what is the relation between

[03:09:56 - 03:10:01]
Emma and

[03:09:58 - 03:10:04]
Thomas Emma is John's son making her

[03:10:01 - 03:10:08]
Mark's daughter Linda being Mark's

[03:10:04 - 03:10:13]
sister is Emma's aunt which makes Thomas

[03:10:08 - 03:10:15]
who is Linda's son Emma's cousin right

[03:10:13 - 03:10:20]
now our input question

[03:10:15 - 03:10:24]
is Alex introduces Brad to his friend as

[03:10:20 - 03:10:28]
the son of the only brother of his

[03:10:24 - 03:10:31]
mother how is Brad related to Alex

[03:10:28 - 03:10:31]
output

[03:10:33 - 03:10:40]
is Brad is the son of the only brother

[03:10:37 - 03:10:42]
of Alex's mother which means Brad is

[03:10:40 - 03:10:46]
Alex

[03:10:42 - 03:10:48]
cousin right logically it correlates the

[03:10:46 - 03:10:49]
Chain of Thought correlates based upon

[03:10:48 - 03:10:52]
your

[03:10:49 - 03:10:54]
examples Chain of Thought can be of

[03:10:52 - 03:10:58]
different types as well where you can

[03:10:54 - 03:11:01]
give different examples uh complex

[03:10:58 - 03:11:03]
examples as well and it works it is zero

[03:11:01 - 03:11:05]
short also it is few short also so

[03:11:03 - 03:11:09]
basically this comes under few short

[03:11:05 - 03:11:11]
Chain of Thought prompt okay zero short

[03:11:09 - 03:11:15]
is separate where you

[03:11:11 - 03:11:19]
give directly what you want without more

[03:11:15 - 03:11:22]
explanation in your prompt designs right

[03:11:19 - 03:11:24]
and then there is automatic Chain of

[03:11:22 - 03:11:28]
Thought as well so there are various

[03:11:24 - 03:11:32]
Chain of Thought prompts as well you can

[03:11:28 - 03:11:34]
explore more and deep dive there as well

[03:11:32 - 03:11:36]
apart from Chain of Thought we have

[03:11:34 - 03:11:37]
different prompting strategies as

[03:11:36 - 03:11:41]
highlighted earlier we have

[03:11:37 - 03:11:46]
self-consistency we have prompt chaining

[03:11:41 - 03:11:50]
we have respond re rephrase We have tree

[03:11:46 - 03:11:54]
of thought we have many Advanced prompt

[03:11:50 - 03:11:58]
strategies which you can deep dive and

[03:11:54 - 03:12:02]
apply based on your requirement your

[03:11:58 - 03:12:05]
prompt design what you want to do with

[03:12:02 - 03:12:09]
your generative models with chat

[03:12:05 - 03:12:11]
GPD hope you have understood these three

[03:12:09 - 03:12:14]
different Advanced prompt strategies

[03:12:11 - 03:12:17]
zero shot with where you do not provide

[03:12:14 - 03:12:20]
any examples few shot where you provide

[03:12:17 - 03:12:22]
where you teach AI with few examples and

[03:12:20 - 03:12:26]
Chain of Thought where it has three

[03:12:22 - 03:12:30]
versions and is for logical thinking is

[03:12:26 - 03:12:33]
used for logical thinking and logical

[03:12:30 - 03:12:36]
problems then we understood what are the

[03:12:33 - 03:12:40]
components of a good prompt what are the

[03:12:36 - 03:12:43]
different checklist that you can follow

[03:12:40 - 03:12:45]
to create a good prompt to design a good

[03:12:43 - 03:12:47]
prompt then we saw what are the

[03:12:45 - 03:12:50]
different Persona patterns that you can

[03:12:47 - 03:12:52]
think of while designing your prompt

[03:12:50 - 03:12:55]
following the

[03:12:52 - 03:12:58]
checklist then we understood different

[03:12:55 - 03:13:00]
Advanced strategies prompt strategies

[03:12:58 - 03:13:04]
which is zero uh short prompting few

[03:13:00 - 03:13:08]
short prompting Chain of Thought with

[03:13:04 - 03:13:10]
examples we saw what are the common

[03:13:08 - 03:13:13]
prompting errors that can

[03:13:10 - 03:13:16]
happen if you miss

[03:13:13 - 03:13:18]
something and at last we saw

[03:13:16 - 03:13:20]
applications of of prompt engineering

[03:13:18 - 03:13:21]
what are the different fields in which

[03:13:20 - 03:13:27]
prompt engineering can be

[03:13:21 - 03:13:29]
used so the key to becoming a proficient

[03:13:27 - 03:13:32]
prompt engineer is to practice

[03:13:29 - 03:13:35]
experiment with different

[03:13:32 - 03:13:37]
prompts again and again give feedback to

[03:13:35 - 03:13:41]
your generative models be it chat GPT be

[03:13:37 - 03:13:44]
it Gemini be it any generative model

[03:13:41 - 03:13:46]
analyze your outcomes what the outcome

[03:13:44 - 03:13:49]
what response you are receiving and

[03:13:46 - 03:13:51]
telling giving them the feedback refine

[03:13:49 - 03:13:53]
your techniques refine your prompts

[03:13:51 - 03:13:55]
based on the checklist that is provided

[03:13:53 - 03:13:56]
based on the different strategies apply

[03:13:55 - 03:13:58]
read about different strategies and

[03:13:56 - 03:14:02]
apply them that is refining your

[03:13:58 - 03:14:06]
techniques keep practicing stay curious

[03:14:02 - 03:14:09]
explore various AI platforms to enhance

[03:14:06 - 03:14:12]
your skills this is how you can become a

[03:14:09 - 03:14:15]
proficient prompt engineer I hope you

[03:14:12 - 03:14:18]
enjoyed this course thank you now that

[03:14:15 - 03:14:21]
you have mastered prompt engineering

[03:14:18 - 03:14:22]
let's dive into some exciting Tech

[03:14:21 - 03:14:27]
applications of chat

[03:14:22 - 03:14:31]
GPT first we'll explore chart GPT for

[03:14:27 - 03:14:35]
coders discover how AI can assist you in

[03:14:31 - 03:14:40]
writing debugging and understanding

[03:14:35 - 03:14:41]
code making programming smoother and

[03:14:40 - 03:14:44]
more

[03:14:41 - 03:14:48]
efficient next we will take a Hands-On

[03:14:44 - 03:14:50]
approach to build a python app using

[03:14:48 - 03:14:55]
chat GP

[03:14:50 - 03:14:58]
4 learn how chat GPT can guide you

[03:14:55 - 03:15:01]
through the development process from

[03:14:58 - 03:15:04]
conceptualization to execution finally

[03:15:01 - 03:15:07]
we'll show you how to build a website

[03:15:04 - 03:15:10]
using chart GPT 40 from designing the

[03:15:07 - 03:15:13]
layout to writing the code see how chart

[03:15:10 - 03:15:17]
GPT can help you create a fully

[03:15:13 - 03:15:22]
functional website with ease

[03:15:17 - 03:15:26]
before going to the next topic that in

[03:15:22 - 03:15:28]
depth into chat GPT or chat GPT 3.5 or 4

[03:15:26 - 03:15:31]
we have to understand a competitive

[03:15:28 - 03:15:35]
comparison for chat GPT which is nothing

[03:15:31 - 03:15:38]
but GitHub co-pilot right even GitHub

[03:15:35 - 03:15:40]
co-pilot will act as chat GPT only but

[03:15:38 - 03:15:42]
let's check out what are the major

[03:15:40 - 03:15:45]
differences between these the first

[03:15:42 - 03:15:49]
thing for those who are starting out to

[03:15:45 - 03:15:53]
learn to interact with with gpts right

[03:15:49 - 03:15:56]
it is suggested to use in free mode

[03:15:53 - 03:15:59]
right that option is available in chat

[03:15:56 - 03:16:02]
GPT only even though you have trial

[03:15:59 - 03:16:05]
version of GitHub end of the day you

[03:16:02 - 03:16:07]
have to pay for the premium version so

[03:16:05 - 03:16:10]
generally a person who is well vered who

[03:16:07 - 03:16:12]
is oriented towards coding technology

[03:16:10 - 03:16:17]
and other professional aspects they can

[03:16:12 - 03:16:20]
go towards GitHub co-pilot right so for

[03:16:17 - 03:16:23]
free you can use Char GPT 3.5 yet again

[03:16:20 - 03:16:26]
you have four where if you want to

[03:16:23 - 03:16:29]
improvise your particular usage or there

[03:16:26 - 03:16:30]
is lots of applications to be done in

[03:16:29 - 03:16:33]
the interface you can go ahead for the

[03:16:30 - 03:16:36]
premium version also but for student

[03:16:33 - 03:16:39]
aspect it is very easy to access chat

[03:16:36 - 03:16:41]
GPT 3.5 which is free and also it

[03:16:39 - 03:16:42]
generates code for you with the

[03:16:41 - 03:16:45]
explanation as well you can communicate

[03:16:42 - 03:16:48]
as doubts to the chat GPT itself just

[03:16:45 - 03:16:50]
you as doubts as or your teacher or

[03:16:48 - 03:16:52]
anyone who is teaching you you can just

[03:16:50 - 03:16:55]
ask your doubts to GPT itself right it's

[03:16:52 - 03:16:58]
a virtual teacher for students if you

[03:16:55 - 03:17:01]
want to apply chat gpt's application

[03:16:58 - 03:17:03]
second Point chat GPT can help develop

[03:17:01 - 03:17:07]
code and follow up on uh if the

[03:17:03 - 03:17:09]
particular code is given by the CH GPT

[03:17:07 - 03:17:11]
back to us if you want to ask any

[03:17:09 - 03:17:13]
improvisation on that you can ask about

[03:17:11 - 03:17:16]
it but one thing if you close the

[03:17:13 - 03:17:19]
particular session it is very difficult

[03:17:16 - 03:17:22]
to get it back or sometimes it is lost

[03:17:19 - 03:17:24]
right so that is the problem of chat GPT

[03:17:22 - 03:17:26]
but GitHub co-pilot is based on the

[03:17:24 - 03:17:28]
machine learning so it is having the

[03:17:26 - 03:17:31]
continuous learning and enhancing the

[03:17:28 - 03:17:34]
suggestions over over time right it is

[03:17:31 - 03:17:38]
not restricted compared to chat GPT so

[03:17:34 - 03:17:40]
as I told chat GPT 3.5 is totally free

[03:17:38 - 03:17:44]
to use and making fantastic option for

[03:17:40 - 03:17:47]
the users to get started right and um

[03:17:44 - 03:17:50]
although if it provides 60-day trial in

[03:17:47 - 03:17:53]
GitHub co- pilot you have to pay after

[03:17:50 - 03:17:55]
60 days but charp 3.5 is not having the

[03:17:53 - 03:17:56]
restriction on a trial perod or

[03:17:55 - 03:18:00]
something the whole complete interface

[03:17:56 - 03:18:02]
is free to use anytime right so you have

[03:18:00 - 03:18:05]
to opt for the paid version or paid

[03:18:02 - 03:18:07]
subscription for GitHub co-pilot after

[03:18:05 - 03:18:11]
60 days of trial that's the rule right

[03:18:07 - 03:18:13]
just like other software systems so this

[03:18:11 - 03:18:17]
is all about the comparison between the

[03:18:13 - 03:18:20]
chat GPT and GitHub co-pilot now let's

[03:18:17 - 03:18:23]
check out how do we use chat GPT with

[03:18:20 - 03:18:26]
respect to two things the first one with

[03:18:23 - 03:18:29]
programming expertise the second one

[03:18:26 - 03:18:32]
without programming expertise so let's

[03:18:29 - 03:18:36]
check out what is the major difference

[03:18:32 - 03:18:39]
and what is the cons and Pros so using

[03:18:36 - 03:18:42]
chat GPT with programming expertise we

[03:18:39 - 03:18:45]
can incorporate Char GPT with our own

[03:18:42 - 03:18:50]
programs or Services by using open AI

[03:18:45 - 03:18:53]
API so we can do that if you have a good

[03:18:50 - 03:18:54]
amount knowledge of what is going on in

[03:18:53 - 03:18:57]
this particular chart GPT how it is

[03:18:54 - 03:19:00]
build what is the back end and other llm

[03:18:57 - 03:19:02]
ideas right large language model ideas

[03:19:00 - 03:19:04]
you can just change the things you can

[03:19:02 - 03:19:07]
make it more creative more intelligent

[03:19:04 - 03:19:08]
chatbot or automated customer service

[03:19:07 - 03:19:10]
system or any other language based

[03:19:08 - 03:19:12]
Solutions you can create if you have

[03:19:10 - 03:19:15]
programming expertise and you are using

[03:19:12 - 03:19:17]
chat GPT with programming knowledge the

[03:19:15 - 03:19:20]
underlying GPT model model can improve

[03:19:17 - 03:19:23]
to be more domain specific on particular

[03:19:20 - 03:19:26]
data set right so chat GPT can be used

[03:19:23 - 03:19:29]
to help with uh having the code Snippets

[03:19:26 - 03:19:31]
creating the documentation or come up

[03:19:29 - 03:19:35]
with uh programming problem solving

[03:19:31 - 03:19:37]
Solutions or ideas so all these aspects

[03:19:35 - 03:19:39]
can be covered with the help of chat GPT

[03:19:37 - 03:19:42]
and you can make use if you are a

[03:19:39 - 03:19:44]
programmer we may influence CH dut's

[03:19:42 - 03:19:47]
behavior and make sure it compiles with

[03:19:44 - 03:19:49]
our requirements generally by being

[03:19:47 - 03:19:51]
aware of the underlying architecture or

[03:19:49 - 03:19:53]
APS if you are a programmer having a

[03:19:51 - 03:19:54]
technical knowledge you know how chat

[03:19:53 - 03:19:56]
GPT is built you know how the

[03:19:54 - 03:19:59]
architecture is you can modify it

[03:19:56 - 03:20:01]
accordingly and make it as the machine

[03:19:59 - 03:20:04]
will think like you think right so these

[03:20:01 - 03:20:06]
are the options you have if you are a

[03:20:04 - 03:20:10]
programmer and if you want to use the

[03:20:06 - 03:20:12]
chat GPT so next you have without

[03:20:10 - 03:20:15]
programming expertise how do you use

[03:20:12 - 03:20:17]
chat GPT and what all you can do we can

[03:20:15 - 03:20:19]
communicate with chat GPT normally with

[03:20:17 - 03:20:21]
day-to-day Words which we use generally

[03:20:19 - 03:20:24]
we ask questions to our teachers in

[03:20:21 - 03:20:26]
day-to-day classes right the same

[03:20:24 - 03:20:29]
particular way you can converse you can

[03:20:26 - 03:20:31]
ask questions to chat GPT it will give

[03:20:29 - 03:20:34]
you the relevant answers you can get

[03:20:31 - 03:20:36]
tips you can get suggestions you can

[03:20:34 - 03:20:39]
obtain creative writing recommendations

[03:20:36 - 03:20:42]
and discuss many ideas brainstorm with

[03:20:39 - 03:20:44]
the GPT right so although GPT is a

[03:20:42 - 03:20:47]
strong language model that can provide

[03:20:44 - 03:20:49]
responses that resemble for those like

[03:20:47 - 03:20:51]
you're talking to a person or any other

[03:20:49 - 03:20:53]
human being it might not be able to

[03:20:51 - 03:20:56]
comprehend sophisticated programming

[03:20:53 - 03:20:59]
related questions right so it's not that

[03:20:56 - 03:21:01]
you can use it to one extent but you

[03:20:59 - 03:21:02]
cannot give the complete use case what's

[03:21:01 - 03:21:04]
happening and you cannot ask the

[03:21:02 - 03:21:06]
solution from the chat TPT it doesn't

[03:21:04 - 03:21:08]
happen end of the day human brain is

[03:21:06 - 03:21:10]
human brain and a machine made is a

[03:21:08 - 03:21:13]
machine made right so you have to

[03:21:10 - 03:21:15]
implement your idea to in order to

[03:21:13 - 03:21:17]
particularly find a solution for your

[03:21:15 - 03:21:19]
problem if you want a h if you want some

[03:21:17 - 03:21:22]
tips and tricks you can use chat GPT

[03:21:19 - 03:21:24]
completely depending on chat GPT I don't

[03:21:22 - 03:21:26]
recommend personally so it is not a good

[03:21:24 - 03:21:28]
idea also you can take it as a support

[03:21:26 - 03:21:30]
you can take it as a

[03:21:28 - 03:21:32]
learning aspect and you can learn you

[03:21:30 - 03:21:34]
can take tips and tricks and Implement

[03:21:32 - 03:21:36]
that in your day-to-day solution problem

[03:21:34 - 03:21:39]
solving sessions but you cannot

[03:21:36 - 03:21:41]
completely depend upon chat GPT so we

[03:21:39 - 03:21:42]
won't be able to expand CH gpt's

[03:21:41 - 03:21:45]
functionalities it's very much

[03:21:42 - 03:21:47]
restricted like you they'll provide few

[03:21:45 - 03:21:49]
of the options you have to use only that

[03:21:47 - 03:21:51]
option you cannot just go do change or

[03:21:49 - 03:21:53]
something just if you have a programming

[03:21:51 - 03:21:56]
language if you have that particular API

[03:21:53 - 03:21:58]
knowledge or programming the GPT or

[03:21:56 - 03:22:00]
architecture or the API according to you

[03:21:58 - 03:22:02]
that is a different case but you don't

[03:22:00 - 03:22:04]
have idea much you only know to use the

[03:22:02 - 03:22:07]
end product uh without the programming

[03:22:04 - 03:22:09]
knowledge then it would be difficult it

[03:22:07 - 03:22:12]
will be very much readymade item to be

[03:22:09 - 03:22:15]
used for you right so this is the

[03:22:12 - 03:22:17]
overall picture of using chat GPT with

[03:22:15 - 03:22:21]
expertise of programming and without

[03:22:17 - 03:22:25]
expertise of programming now let's use

[03:22:21 - 03:22:27]
chat TPT to build programs so let's see

[03:22:25 - 03:22:30]
what are the prompts we are going to

[03:22:27 - 03:22:33]
execute on the interface first the first

[03:22:30 - 03:22:38]
task we'll be going to do is we'll

[03:22:33 - 03:22:41]
create a program to build BMI calculator

[03:22:38 - 03:22:44]
and we'll also enhance and find the

[03:22:41 - 03:22:46]
efficiency of that particular program

[03:22:44 - 03:22:49]
and different methods how we can execute

[03:22:46 - 03:22:52]
this program this applies to all the

[03:22:49 - 03:22:55]
programs which I'll execute one thing

[03:22:52 - 03:22:57]
I'll give you the multiple options with

[03:22:55 - 03:23:01]
the chat GPT how to resolve one

[03:22:57 - 03:23:04]
particular problem with different Logics

[03:23:01 - 03:23:07]
and next I'll be also asking the chat

[03:23:04 - 03:23:09]
GPT what is the efficiency of the

[03:23:07 - 03:23:13]
previous method and the method we are

[03:23:09 - 03:23:16]
executing now and how it is going how it

[03:23:13 - 03:23:18]
is making the particular code efficient

[03:23:16 - 03:23:21]
right so this will apply for all the

[03:23:18 - 03:23:23]
three tasks the second task what we will

[03:23:21 - 03:23:25]
do is we will create a program to

[03:23:23 - 03:23:28]
display powers of two using Anonymous

[03:23:25 - 03:23:32]
function as a third task we will check

[03:23:28 - 03:23:35]
if two strings are anagram right so we

[03:23:32 - 03:23:38]
will find out how the chat GPT will

[03:23:35 - 03:23:42]
converse with us for the prompts which

[03:23:38 - 03:23:44]
we give right so let's quickly switch to

[03:23:42 - 03:23:48]
the chat GPT interface

[03:23:44 - 03:23:51]
now so this is the chat GPT interface

[03:23:48 - 03:23:54]
you have two options if you are a

[03:23:51 - 03:23:58]
premium subscriber you can toggle

[03:23:54 - 03:24:01]
between GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 right you can

[03:23:58 - 03:24:04]
just go to this version or you want

[03:24:01 - 03:24:06]
preferably using 3.5 generally people

[03:24:04 - 03:24:08]
don't invest on the premium until unless

[03:24:06 - 03:24:11]
is very much necessary for them so what

[03:24:08 - 03:24:14]
do I do I'll give the comparison between

[03:24:11 - 03:24:19]
the two interfaces but I'll be working

[03:24:14 - 03:24:23]
most of all in chat GPT 3.5 to have to

[03:24:19 - 03:24:27]
cater the broader audiences right now

[03:24:23 - 03:24:31]
let's execute the first task which we

[03:24:27 - 03:24:31]
listed that is write a

[03:24:32 - 03:24:38]
program

[03:24:34 - 03:24:43]
to find or

[03:24:38 - 03:24:46]
calculate BMI right so I'll give enter

[03:24:43 - 03:24:50]
and let's see it is giving us Direct

[03:24:46 - 03:24:52]
a program in Python programming language

[03:24:50 - 03:24:57]
how do you calculate body mass index

[03:24:52 - 03:24:59]
that is BMI right so this is how the

[03:24:57 - 03:25:02]
program look like and it will give you

[03:24:59 - 03:25:04]
in the comments what it is doing what is

[03:25:02 - 03:25:06]
this particular function for what it is

[03:25:04 - 03:25:09]
applying how it is calculating what is

[03:25:06 - 03:25:11]
the formula and how it is converting how

[03:25:09 - 03:25:13]
it is interpreting the corresponding

[03:25:11 - 03:25:16]
messages in the different categories

[03:25:13 - 03:25:18]
whether if your BMI is less than 18 .5

[03:25:16 - 03:25:20]
you're underweight and if you're having

[03:25:18 - 03:25:23]
certain middle range it is normal weight

[03:25:20 - 03:25:26]
and it is crossing 25 it is overweight

[03:25:23 - 03:25:29]
and above that 30 it's supposed to be

[03:25:26 - 03:25:31]
obese so all these calculation

[03:25:29 - 03:25:35]
interpretation is done and it is giving

[03:25:31 - 03:25:37]
us the output right so the major thing

[03:25:35 - 03:25:40]
here is it is giving you the program as

[03:25:37 - 03:25:42]
in when you ask without having any other

[03:25:40 - 03:25:46]
delay it is giving you the answer in

[03:25:42 - 03:25:48]
seconds right so what you have to do to

[03:25:46 - 03:25:51]
execute you have to copy paste into a

[03:25:48 - 03:25:54]
python interpreter or online python

[03:25:51 - 03:25:57]
executor and you can compile and run the

[03:25:54 - 03:26:02]
particular program right so next I will

[03:25:57 - 03:26:04]
ask what is the efficiency of the code

[03:26:02 - 03:26:08]
above right it just normally how you

[03:26:04 - 03:26:11]
talk you can talk to the system so it

[03:26:08 - 03:26:14]
will give efficiency calculated uh with

[03:26:11 - 03:26:16]
so and so time complexity is bigo of one

[03:26:14 - 03:26:18]
and you're having overall structure an

[03:26:16 - 03:26:20]
explanation is given what is the

[03:26:18 - 03:26:23]
efficiency of this particular code which

[03:26:20 - 03:26:26]
is put up above so it is telling it is

[03:26:23 - 03:26:29]
having the time complexity of bigo

[03:26:26 - 03:26:32]
notated one right so bigo one is the

[03:26:29 - 03:26:34]
time complexity and which is okay it is

[03:26:32 - 03:26:37]
not having a bad time complexity it is

[03:26:34 - 03:26:40]
having a very good time complexity right

[03:26:37 - 03:26:43]
so this is the overall structure it is

[03:26:40 - 03:26:47]
giving you the explanation for the same

[03:26:43 - 03:26:49]
now let's check the next method what is

[03:26:47 - 03:26:53]
the option it can provide in order to

[03:26:49 - 03:26:57]
solve this particular program right

[03:26:53 - 03:26:59]
so any other

[03:26:57 - 03:27:01]
method uh to

[03:26:59 - 03:27:05]
calculate

[03:27:01 - 03:27:09]
BMI you can just give this also and

[03:27:05 - 03:27:12]
check what the answer is generated

[03:27:09 - 03:27:14]
certainly there is another common method

[03:27:12 - 03:27:17]
you in order to solve this particular

[03:27:14 - 03:27:19]
problem statement in Python so it is

[03:27:17 - 03:27:21]
giving a shorter code if you could see

[03:27:19 - 03:27:24]
if you just compare in a Layman

[03:27:21 - 03:27:29]
perspective this is a larger code and it

[03:27:24 - 03:27:31]
is a shorter code again what is

[03:27:29 - 03:27:35]
the

[03:27:31 - 03:27:37]
efficiency of this code if I ask the

[03:27:35 - 03:27:39]
same question the method is different

[03:27:37 - 03:27:42]
now so let me ask the same question it

[03:27:39 - 03:27:46]
says yes the time complexity is Big go

[03:27:42 - 03:27:49]
of one again it is a good performance

[03:27:46 - 03:27:51]
consideration and this is the overall

[03:27:49 - 03:27:54]
report for the one single question which

[03:27:51 - 03:27:58]
is been provided by the chat gpg so I

[03:27:54 - 03:28:03]
will give the third option any other

[03:27:58 - 03:28:07]
method we can Implement to

[03:28:03 - 03:28:11]
calculate BMI so this is my

[03:28:07 - 03:28:13]
last query yes certainly there is one

[03:28:11 - 03:28:15]
more approach which involves weights in

[03:28:13 - 03:28:18]
kilograms and Heights and centimeters so

[03:28:15 - 03:28:21]
it is giving us the variations between I

[03:28:18 - 03:28:25]
think in the previous one it was

[03:28:21 - 03:28:28]
considering the weight height again it

[03:28:25 - 03:28:31]
is giving you a variety of

[03:28:28 - 03:28:33]
solution if you compare both of it you

[03:28:31 - 03:28:35]
might not find much difference between

[03:28:33 - 03:28:38]
these two or it might be the same

[03:28:35 - 03:28:41]
program as well after one point of time

[03:28:38 - 03:28:44]
if there is no solution no other logic

[03:28:41 - 03:28:46]
applicable in any other way it will stop

[03:28:44 - 03:28:49]
generating and it will tell start giving

[03:28:46 - 03:28:51]
you the particular program repeatedly so

[03:28:49 - 03:28:54]
that is when you understand there is end

[03:28:51 - 03:28:58]
for it right because in 3.5 you have

[03:28:54 - 03:29:01]
only the data up to 2021 right so it is

[03:28:58 - 03:29:03]
not real time or it is not learning with

[03:29:01 - 03:29:05]
the help of machine learning method with

[03:29:03 - 03:29:07]
the help of users communication it is

[03:29:05 - 03:29:09]
not learning much so whatever the data

[03:29:07 - 03:29:14]
has been trained it is giving you the

[03:29:09 - 03:29:17]
output right so this is how you

[03:29:14 - 03:29:20]
communicate you can use this Char gbt to

[03:29:17 - 03:29:23]
build a program this is the first task

[03:29:20 - 03:29:26]
which we have completed now let's check

[03:29:23 - 03:29:30]
out next program to

[03:29:26 - 03:29:32]
write a program in Python and display

[03:29:30 - 03:29:35]
powers of two using Anonymous function

[03:29:32 - 03:29:38]
let me enter this and let's check how

[03:29:35 - 03:29:41]
does this look right so it is giving you

[03:29:38 - 03:29:43]
enter the limit of powers and uh it will

[03:29:41 - 03:29:45]
calculate using the anonymous function

[03:29:43 - 03:29:46]
the powers is calculated and it is

[03:29:45 - 03:29:48]
displayed right it is giving you

[03:29:46 - 03:29:51]
explanation what is happening in the

[03:29:48 - 03:29:55]
code as well so let's quickly check out

[03:29:51 - 03:29:55]
what is the fici

[03:29:56 - 03:30:02]
ncy so what is the efficiency if you ask

[03:29:59 - 03:30:05]
it will give you time complexity the

[03:30:02 - 03:30:08]
complete details space complexity and it

[03:30:05 - 03:30:12]
is going with respect to the generalized

[03:30:08 - 03:30:15]
answer so let me again remodify this

[03:30:12 - 03:30:18]
question I'll copy and paste the same

[03:30:15 - 03:30:23]
efficiency of above

[03:30:18 - 03:30:25]
code right so let's see I apologize for

[03:30:23 - 03:30:29]
any confusion but I must correct my

[03:30:25 - 03:30:31]
previous response so it is apologizing

[03:30:29 - 03:30:34]
for us that it did not understand our

[03:30:31 - 03:30:36]
question properly so now it is giving us

[03:30:34 - 03:30:39]
this particular explanation with respect

[03:30:36 - 03:30:43]
to time complexity and space complexity

[03:30:39 - 03:30:47]
right so this is how chat GPT will

[03:30:43 - 03:30:55]
interact so next let's check out any

[03:30:47 - 03:30:57]
other method to solve the above query so

[03:30:55 - 03:31:00]
I'm giving with the spelling mistake

[03:30:57 - 03:31:02]
also but still it can Rectify what I'm

[03:31:00 - 03:31:04]
talking about what is the decent

[03:31:02 - 03:31:07]
question which I give the chat GPD that

[03:31:04 - 03:31:10]
is powers of two calculation right so

[03:31:07 - 03:31:13]
again it is giving us a different logic

[03:31:10 - 03:31:16]
here right you can do this two and fr

[03:31:13 - 03:31:19]
right you can just have a lots of

[03:31:16 - 03:31:21]
conversation with the GPT and create the

[03:31:19 - 03:31:24]
programs which you require as per the

[03:31:21 - 03:31:26]
logic you want and it if you want a

[03:31:24 - 03:31:28]
shter code if you want a lenier code if

[03:31:26 - 03:31:31]
you want a efficient code depends upon

[03:31:28 - 03:31:33]
the input you give and the chip will

[03:31:31 - 03:31:37]
give you the output accordingly right so

[03:31:33 - 03:31:41]
let's execute the third task let's have

[03:31:37 - 03:31:44]
a program executed let's build a final

[03:31:41 - 03:31:47]
one now let's try out the last one write

[03:31:44 - 03:31:51]
a program to check if two strings are

[03:31:47 - 03:31:55]
anagram so let's learn how this

[03:31:51 - 03:31:57]
particular answer is provided right so

[03:31:55 - 03:32:00]
it will first give you the function to

[03:31:57 - 03:32:02]
check if two strings are anagram and it

[03:32:00 - 03:32:03]
will give the length it will check the

[03:32:02 - 03:32:04]
length and it will give the frequency of

[03:32:03 - 03:32:06]
the characters of the both particular

[03:32:04 - 03:32:09]
strings which given all character

[03:32:06 - 03:32:12]
frequency should be zero for anagrams so

[03:32:09 - 03:32:14]
it will take the input from the user it

[03:32:12 - 03:32:16]
will check whether it is an anagram or

[03:32:14 - 03:32:17]
not it will give you the output so this

[03:32:16 - 03:32:20]
is the basic program which has been

[03:32:17 - 03:32:24]
created and it will give the explanation

[03:32:20 - 03:32:27]
how it is moving as well right so let me

[03:32:24 - 03:32:29]
take that particular question what is

[03:32:27 - 03:32:33]
the

[03:32:29 - 03:32:37]
efficiency of the above

[03:32:33 - 03:32:40]
code so if you ask this it will give you

[03:32:37 - 03:32:42]
the time complexity and sometimes it

[03:32:40 - 03:32:45]
will be giving you the space complexity

[03:32:42 - 03:32:48]
as well so for now it is giving us the

[03:32:45 - 03:32:52]
comp comparison of the time complexity

[03:32:48 - 03:32:55]
and how it is producing the output how

[03:32:52 - 03:32:57]
efficient it is how efficient it can be

[03:32:55 - 03:32:59]
if you improvise your code if you cut

[03:32:57 - 03:33:04]
shot your code if you make it much more

[03:32:59 - 03:33:05]
optimized right so any other method do

[03:33:04 - 03:33:08]
we

[03:33:05 - 03:33:10]
have so let's have this question when

[03:33:08 - 03:33:12]
you ask this question it will say yes we

[03:33:10 - 03:33:15]
have another method to solve the

[03:33:12 - 03:33:18]
particular problem of anagram so this is

[03:33:15 - 03:33:21]
the output for the same right so this

[03:33:18 - 03:33:25]
completes the overall picture of how do

[03:33:21 - 03:33:28]
you build programs using chat GPT right

[03:33:25 - 03:33:31]
so this is the output for you and this

[03:33:28 - 03:33:35]
is how you Converse between the GPT and

[03:33:31 - 03:33:38]
from The Real World right now let's see

[03:33:35 - 03:33:39]
code interpreter in chat GPT so what is

[03:33:38 - 03:33:42]
this code

[03:33:39 - 03:33:44]
interpreter it is a feature which is

[03:33:42 - 03:33:48]
still in beta version applied in chat

[03:33:44 - 03:33:51]
jpt version four right so first let's

[03:33:48 - 03:33:54]
understand what is code interpreter in

[03:33:51 - 03:33:57]
chat GPT so the most recent addition by

[03:33:54 - 03:34:00]
open AI to chat GPT particularly as I

[03:33:57 - 03:34:03]
told you for chat GPT model 4 it is code

[03:34:00 - 03:34:06]
interpreter which enables to execute the

[03:34:03 - 03:34:09]
python code in real working environment

[03:34:06 - 03:34:11]
and it will also have certain essential

[03:34:09 - 03:34:13]
functions and boxed in Python

[03:34:11 - 03:34:16]
environment where an python code can be

[03:34:13 - 03:34:19]
run and for any other purpose you can

[03:34:16 - 03:34:21]
use right it seems like it is only used

[03:34:19 - 03:34:24]
for the particular programmers or

[03:34:21 - 03:34:27]
oriented towards technological aspects

[03:34:24 - 03:34:30]
building an application or something but

[03:34:27 - 03:34:34]
code interpreter helps students also and

[03:34:30 - 03:34:37]
Learners also it can assist in regular

[03:34:34 - 03:34:41]
basic for variety of tasks as well right

[03:34:37 - 03:34:45]
so this is the code interpreter in chat

[03:34:41 - 03:34:48]
GPT now let's see how do we interpret

[03:34:45 - 03:34:50]
code using chat GPT right so before

[03:34:48 - 03:34:52]
doing that we'll have to compare two

[03:34:50 - 03:34:57]
different aspects as I told you that is

[03:34:52 - 03:35:03]
3.5 and four model of chat GPT so chat

[03:34:57 - 03:35:06]
GPT 3.5 is uni model the chat GPT or the

[03:35:03 - 03:35:09]
chatbot which is version 3.5 only

[03:35:06 - 03:35:12]
understands and interprets the text

[03:35:09 - 03:35:17]
input it will interpret the text input

[03:35:12 - 03:35:20]
only it is a uni model but CH J 4 can

[03:35:17 - 03:35:23]
Now understand and process even images

[03:35:20 - 03:35:27]
it accepts both text and image prompts

[03:35:23 - 03:35:30]
hence it is multimodel right so the

[03:35:27 - 03:35:35]
first comparison is unimodel 3.5 and

[03:35:30 - 03:35:38]
multimodel 4 right CH 3.5 was failing to

[03:35:35 - 03:35:41]
understand the nuanes when it comes to

[03:35:38 - 03:35:44]
natural human language if you remember

[03:35:41 - 03:35:46]
while I was executing I asked what is

[03:35:44 - 03:35:48]
the efficiency

[03:35:46 - 03:35:50]
and it gave the generalized answer

[03:35:48 - 03:35:52]
efficiency is nothing but time

[03:35:50 - 03:35:54]
complexity and space complexity but once

[03:35:52 - 03:35:56]
I changed the prompt what is the

[03:35:54 - 03:35:59]
efficiency of the above code it

[03:35:56 - 03:36:02]
suggested it gave me the answer I

[03:35:59 - 03:36:05]
apologize that I understood your prompt

[03:36:02 - 03:36:07]
wrong and this is the answer for your

[03:36:05 - 03:36:11]
particular question so it is trying to

[03:36:07 - 03:36:13]
be much Humane compared to it is not

[03:36:11 - 03:36:15]
being a machine like you it will just

[03:36:13 - 03:36:17]
process what you ask and it will throw

[03:36:15 - 03:36:19]
back the output it is not doing that it

[03:36:17 - 03:36:22]
is trying to understand what is the

[03:36:19 - 03:36:25]
aspect what is the human being trying to

[03:36:22 - 03:36:27]
tell me right so that is how it is

[03:36:25 - 03:36:30]
interacting in GPT 4 we can produce

[03:36:27 - 03:36:33]
improvised poems you can write essays it

[03:36:30 - 03:36:36]
is much more creative and it is having

[03:36:33 - 03:36:40]
coherence compared to 3.5 right coming

[03:36:36 - 03:36:42]
up to the third Point Char 3.5 has no

[03:36:40 - 03:36:44]
code interpreter option right in code

[03:36:42 - 03:36:46]
interpretation is not there it is just

[03:36:44 - 03:36:47]
giving you certain coms in the code and

[03:36:46 - 03:36:49]
giving the explanation for the code if

[03:36:47 - 03:36:51]
you ask it will give the code

[03:36:49 - 03:36:55]
documentation that's it it is not having

[03:36:51 - 03:36:58]
The Interpreter right chity 4 has code

[03:36:55 - 03:37:00]
interpreter which is in beta version

[03:36:58 - 03:37:03]
only that feature is available let's see

[03:37:00 - 03:37:06]
when we go to the interface charity 3.5

[03:37:03 - 03:37:09]
does not allow file upload or output

[03:37:06 - 03:37:13]
download so uploading and downloading is

[03:37:09 - 03:37:16]
not present in chat gbt 3.5 but in four

[03:37:13 - 03:37:18]
we have the up loading of code file

[03:37:16 - 03:37:21]
option also downloading the output

[03:37:18 - 03:37:23]
option right so these are the

[03:37:21 - 03:37:25]
differences between the chart GPT itself

[03:37:23 - 03:37:28]
between the different versions or models

[03:37:25 - 03:37:31]
that is 3.5 and four let's see what is

[03:37:28 - 03:37:35]
the task we can perform with respect to

[03:37:31 - 03:37:38]
interpret the code in 3.5 and how do you

[03:37:35 - 03:37:40]
interpret the particular code in four as

[03:37:38 - 03:37:42]
well so first I'll cover the theoretical

[03:37:40 - 03:37:44]
aspect and let's then jump into the

[03:37:42 - 03:37:46]
interface and check out the same thing

[03:37:44 - 03:37:50]
right for the better equality and

[03:37:46 - 03:37:52]
Clarity so first task is to have a

[03:37:50 - 03:37:56]
program which is adding two numbers

[03:37:52 - 03:38:00]
right obviously it is having a addition

[03:37:56 - 03:38:04]
operator and two different operant

[03:38:00 - 03:38:06]
adding 2 + 3 or 5 + 6 depends right we

[03:38:04 - 03:38:09]
are doing a normal addition task number

[03:38:06 - 03:38:11]
two we modify the existing code and ask

[03:38:09 - 03:38:14]
for extra features anything we can add

[03:38:11 - 03:38:16]
to that particular code I am thinking

[03:38:14 - 03:38:18]
that we can do an arithmetic operation

[03:38:16 - 03:38:20]
only set of arithmetic operation that is

[03:38:18 - 03:38:23]
addition subtraction multiplication

[03:38:20 - 03:38:25]
division let's see what does charp will

[03:38:23 - 03:38:29]
suggest us to improvise our code right

[03:38:25 - 03:38:33]
so let's converse with the charge BT

[03:38:29 - 03:38:35]
3.5 then how do you execute in 4.0 the

[03:38:33 - 03:38:37]
same thing you have to do certain

[03:38:35 - 03:38:39]
settings which I'll be showing then

[03:38:37 - 03:38:41]
let's upload the code file and we'll try

[03:38:39 - 03:38:43]
to modify the existing code and ask for

[03:38:41 - 03:38:45]
the new feature in that itself also we

[03:38:43 - 03:38:48]
will try to download the modified code

[03:38:45 - 03:38:52]
code right so we'll be doing all this

[03:38:48 - 03:38:56]
exercises now in the chat GPT

[03:38:52 - 03:39:00]
[Music]

[03:38:56 - 03:39:05]
interface now let's check out how do you

[03:39:00 - 03:39:09]
add two numbers by using chat GPT

[03:39:05 - 03:39:13]
3.5 without having The Interpreter

[03:39:09 - 03:39:15]
option on so how do you check let's see

[03:39:13 - 03:39:19]
where the interpreter is available you

[03:39:15 - 03:39:22]
have to go to the settings it says

[03:39:19 - 03:39:27]
settings in beta it will say features if

[03:39:22 - 03:39:30]
you see code interpreter is off for 3.5

[03:39:27 - 03:39:35]
you can switch on this and you can start

[03:39:30 - 03:39:38]
working with the program and the prompt

[03:39:35 - 03:39:42]
so write a

[03:39:38 - 03:39:46]
program to add two

[03:39:42 - 03:39:51]
numbers so I am just trying to execute

[03:39:46 - 03:39:54]
it is writing a program very quickly any

[03:39:51 - 03:39:54]
other

[03:39:54 - 03:40:02]
features can we add to this

[03:39:59 - 03:40:06]
program so I'm asking question it's only

[03:40:02 - 03:40:08]
addition so what all can we add so it is

[03:40:06 - 03:40:09]
suggesting certainly you can enhance the

[03:40:08 - 03:40:12]
program by adding some additional

[03:40:09 - 03:40:15]
features like input validation error

[03:40:12 - 03:40:18]
handling and option to continue adding

[03:40:15 - 03:40:20]
adding more numbers Etc right so this is

[03:40:18 - 03:40:23]
one of the option

[03:40:20 - 03:40:27]
given can we

[03:40:23 - 03:40:32]
add other arithmetic

[03:40:27 - 03:40:36]
operators to addition of two

[03:40:32 - 03:40:36]
numbers if

[03:40:36 - 03:40:42]
so

[03:40:38 - 03:40:45]
kindly provide the program so I'm just

[03:40:42 - 03:40:47]
asking like we ask others so it is

[03:40:45 - 03:40:50]
giving you the complete arithmetic

[03:40:47 - 03:40:52]
operation program here right so what it

[03:40:50 - 03:40:54]
says of course you can modify the

[03:40:52 - 03:40:55]
program and handle other arithmetic

[03:40:54 - 03:40:58]
operators as well like subtraction

[03:40:55 - 03:41:01]
multiplication and deficient right so

[03:40:58 - 03:41:06]
updat version updated program is also

[03:41:01 - 03:41:09]
given so how do you download this so you

[03:41:06 - 03:41:12]
cannot download

[03:41:09 - 03:41:13]
so let's ask how

[03:41:12 - 03:41:16]
to

[03:41:13 - 03:41:20]
execute this

[03:41:16 - 03:41:23]
code in chat GPT let's explore let's ask

[03:41:20 - 03:41:27]
question how does it work so it is

[03:41:23 - 03:41:30]
telling install a python interface and

[03:41:27 - 03:41:32]
then create a python file and then run

[03:41:30 - 03:41:34]
this the follow the instruction it is

[03:41:32 - 03:41:36]
giving you how to execute also if you

[03:41:34 - 03:41:41]
are having any issues you can download

[03:41:36 - 03:41:44]
the uh python software and you can start

[03:41:41 - 03:41:47]
running your program by copying it to a

[03:41:44 - 03:41:47]
python file right

[03:41:47 - 03:41:54]
so what is the

[03:41:52 - 03:41:57]
interpretation so what is the

[03:41:54 - 03:42:00]
interpretation of the code above let's

[03:41:57 - 03:42:02]
see that so it is giving you

[03:42:00 - 03:42:04]
interpretation of the code completely

[03:42:02 - 03:42:05]
function definitions are addition

[03:42:04 - 03:42:08]
subtraction multiplication division you

[03:42:05 - 03:42:12]
are having input validation so like this

[03:42:08 - 03:42:12]
if you switch off this interpreter

[03:42:15 - 03:42:17]
let's

[03:42:19 - 03:42:29]
see can we get the

[03:42:24 - 03:42:32]
interpretation of the code above still

[03:42:29 - 03:42:36]
it will give the interpretation as well

[03:42:32 - 03:42:39]
right so if you ask the query it

[03:42:36 - 03:42:42]
executes the prompt actually so if you

[03:42:39 - 03:42:44]
switch on or switch off but if you ask

[03:42:42 - 03:42:47]
the interpretation it will give you or

[03:42:44 - 03:42:52]
else by default it will give you the

[03:42:47 - 03:42:57]
code right so now it's our turn to check

[03:42:52 - 03:42:59]
out how does the chat GPT 4 will work so

[03:42:57 - 03:43:02]
I'll take a new chat here I'll switch to

[03:42:59 - 03:43:05]
chat GPT 4 and there is an option which

[03:43:02 - 03:43:07]
is in default and plugins are getting

[03:43:05 - 03:43:09]
sorted so there are different plugins

[03:43:07 - 03:43:12]
you can enable right you have various

[03:43:09 - 03:43:15]
plugins there so it is having plug-in

[03:43:12 - 03:43:18]
store like it is giving about plug-in

[03:43:15 - 03:43:20]
ideas so you have so many plugins code

[03:43:18 - 03:43:23]
pad or it is having I'm just installing

[03:43:20 - 03:43:25]
codepad just like that and uh you can

[03:43:23 - 03:43:27]
install it's very easy click on this it

[03:43:25 - 03:43:30]
will install and you can select between

[03:43:27 - 03:43:32]
it right so it is having ask the code it

[03:43:30 - 03:43:34]
is having ask your prf and it is having

[03:43:32 - 03:43:37]
various kinds of plugins available

[03:43:34 - 03:43:40]
already prompt perfect show me diagram

[03:43:37 - 03:43:42]
so smart slides so Wikipedia everything

[03:43:40 - 03:43:45]
you can just inculcate with the help of

[03:43:42 - 03:43:47]
the plugin so here here there's an

[03:43:45 - 03:43:49]
option to choose if you have multiple

[03:43:47 - 03:43:51]
plugins you can switch between with the

[03:43:49 - 03:43:53]
help of this particular option so I'm

[03:43:51 - 03:43:57]
just giving a interface over view here

[03:43:53 - 03:44:00]
before starting right again let's

[03:43:57 - 03:44:03]
see settings we'll go to Beta features

[03:44:00 - 03:44:05]
interpreter is off so let me switch on

[03:44:03 - 03:44:07]
The Interpreter try a version of chart

[03:44:05 - 03:44:09]
GPD that knows how to write and execute

[03:44:07 - 03:44:12]
python code and can work with file

[03:44:09 - 03:44:13]
uploads also so let's see the major

[03:44:12 - 03:44:16]
difference now I didn't talk about the

[03:44:13 - 03:44:18]
difference in 3.5 I just executed and I

[03:44:16 - 03:44:21]
just showed you the different particular

[03:44:18 - 03:44:24]
options available so if you switch on

[03:44:21 - 03:44:28]
the code interpreter it did not change

[03:44:24 - 03:44:32]
anything in the 3.5 if you go to 3.5 it

[03:44:28 - 03:44:33]
will not give you any option if you on

[03:44:32 - 03:44:36]
The Interpreter or if you don't on The

[03:44:33 - 03:44:38]
Interpreter right why was that

[03:44:36 - 03:44:40]
particular thing happening because I'm

[03:44:38 - 03:44:43]
working in the premium version this

[03:44:40 - 03:44:46]
settings this particular settings for

[03:44:43 - 03:44:48]
beta features was applicable only 44

[03:44:46 - 03:44:50]
right if you log to a general chart GPT

[03:44:48 - 03:44:53]
3.5 which you're not having premium

[03:44:50 - 03:44:55]
version this particular settings and

[03:44:53 - 03:44:57]
beta this beta feature will not be

[03:44:55 - 03:44:59]
available for you right so that is why

[03:44:57 - 03:45:02]
when you executed the previous code in

[03:44:59 - 03:45:03]
3.5 there was no change if you select

[03:45:02 - 03:45:06]
interpreter if you switch off if you

[03:45:03 - 03:45:09]
switch on there is no change it was

[03:45:06 - 03:45:11]
implying only for gp4 not for 3.5 right

[03:45:09 - 03:45:13]
hope this is clear now right the

[03:45:11 - 03:45:17]
confusion is sorted so now let's talk

[03:45:13 - 03:45:20]
about GPT 4 gp4 had code interpreter in

[03:45:17 - 03:45:23]
the beta version so I am selecting that

[03:45:20 - 03:45:25]
code interpreter if you switch off let's

[03:45:23 - 03:45:28]
check out once again to be double sure

[03:45:25 - 03:45:31]
if you switch off and if you go back to

[03:45:28 - 03:45:34]
char GPT 4 you could see only plugin and

[03:45:31 - 03:45:35]
default right so that's the major

[03:45:34 - 03:45:38]
difference so quickly I'll switch on The

[03:45:35 - 03:45:41]
Interpreter I'll go select the code

[03:45:38 - 03:45:44]
interpreter and if you see the change

[03:45:41 - 03:45:46]
you have a addition option here upload

[03:45:44 - 03:45:49]
option right we say plus symbol or

[03:45:46 - 03:45:52]
addition option upload file can be done

[03:45:49 - 03:45:55]
here so I'm selecting a code which is

[03:45:52 - 03:45:59]
already existing I'm uploading the code

[03:45:55 - 03:46:01]
that is a python file to chat GPT 4

[03:45:59 - 03:46:05]
right so with the help of code

[03:46:01 - 03:46:08]
interpreter option so I'm sending this

[03:46:05 - 03:46:11]
code file to chat gp4 it will give the

[03:46:08 - 03:46:12]
overall picture what is happening inside

[03:46:11 - 03:46:15]
the code file it looks like you have

[03:46:12 - 03:46:21]
uploaded the Jupiter notebook

[03:46:15 - 03:46:24]
file so it says interpreter example _ do

[03:46:21 - 03:46:27]
ipynb and how can I assist with this

[03:46:24 - 03:46:30]
particular code you have uploaded so

[03:46:27 - 03:46:33]
please

[03:46:30 - 03:46:35]
provide the

[03:46:33 - 03:46:39]
output

[03:46:35 - 03:46:43]
so you ask kindly provide the output it

[03:46:39 - 03:46:45]
will work on that particular code file

[03:46:43 - 03:46:48]
and it will try to fetch the output or

[03:46:45 - 03:46:49]
it will not let's see finished working

[03:46:48 - 03:46:52]
it appears the notebook contains only

[03:46:49 - 03:46:55]
code cell so let's execute the cell to

[03:46:52 - 03:46:57]
display shall we proceed it is asking so

[03:46:55 - 03:47:00]
I'm just giving yes to that right when

[03:46:57 - 03:47:02]
you give s to that let's see it is

[03:47:00 - 03:47:05]
working it is finished work and the Cod

[03:47:02 - 03:47:08]
sell in the notebook yes the program

[03:47:05 - 03:47:10]
which I had given I had already given

[03:47:08 - 03:47:13]
two different numbers that is 1.5 and

[03:47:10 - 03:47:15]
6.3 it has added and it is giving you

[03:47:13 - 03:47:17]
the output for that is there anything

[03:47:15 - 03:47:20]
else I want to do with this particular

[03:47:17 - 03:47:23]
notebook so what do I do please add

[03:47:20 - 03:47:27]
extra

[03:47:23 - 03:47:31]
features enhance the code

[03:47:27 - 03:47:36]
file and

[03:47:31 - 03:47:39]
display and display the code so let me

[03:47:36 - 03:47:41]
see how does this extra feature is added

[03:47:39 - 03:47:45]
certainly however I need some guidance

[03:47:41 - 03:47:49]
so what all I should do it is asking as

[03:47:45 - 03:47:49]
only so please

[03:47:50 - 03:47:58]
add arithmetic operators with

[03:47:55 - 03:48:02]
addition so I'm just

[03:47:58 - 03:48:05]
giving this particular input like try to

[03:48:02 - 03:48:07]
execute yes it is saying yes operations

[03:48:05 - 03:48:09]
I will add is subtraction multiplication

[03:48:07 - 03:48:11]
division along with the addition so this

[03:48:09 - 03:48:14]
is how this particular code will look

[03:48:11 - 03:48:16]
like see the same input which I've given

[03:48:14 - 03:48:19]
in the code file is only taken that

[03:48:16 - 03:48:21]
means whatever the code file you have

[03:48:19 - 03:48:23]
given it is improvising that according

[03:48:21 - 03:48:25]
to your prompts provided it is not

[03:48:23 - 03:48:28]
creating a own program if it is creating

[03:48:25 - 03:48:30]
a own program the inputs would be

[03:48:28 - 03:48:32]
different right so this is how it is

[03:48:30 - 03:48:35]
improvising

[03:48:32 - 03:48:35]
so I want

[03:48:36 - 03:48:45]
to download the modified code file so

[03:48:42 - 03:48:46]
let me tell I want to download this

[03:48:45 - 03:48:49]
particular code

[03:48:46 - 03:48:52]
file sure you can do that it is trying

[03:48:49 - 03:48:54]
to wrap up into python code file might

[03:48:52 - 03:48:57]
be so let's check out what it is trying

[03:48:54 - 03:49:00]
to do so it is trying to convert this

[03:48:57 - 03:49:02]
particular added features of this

[03:49:00 - 03:49:03]
particular code file addition was the

[03:49:02 - 03:49:05]
only thing which I uploaded but

[03:49:03 - 03:49:07]
subtraction multiplication division is

[03:49:05 - 03:49:09]
added that is the extra of each is added

[03:49:07 - 03:49:12]
according to our instruction so it is

[03:49:09 - 03:49:15]
giving us the downloadable link for this

[03:49:12 - 03:49:17]
particular code file it says download

[03:49:15 - 03:49:19]
modified interpretation example code it

[03:49:17 - 03:49:23]
is giving us the name also it is

[03:49:19 - 03:49:26]
modified right so if you click on the

[03:49:23 - 03:49:28]
download link it will download if you

[03:49:26 - 03:49:31]
could see the download has been done

[03:49:28 - 03:49:33]
here right so this is the major

[03:49:31 - 03:49:37]
difference which I was talking about how

[03:49:33 - 03:49:41]
do you use code interpreter in 3.5 of CH

[03:49:37 - 03:49:43]
GPT and four model of Chip so these

[03:49:41 - 03:49:46]
features are available it is having a

[03:49:43 - 03:49:47]
Sandbox of python it will try to execute

[03:49:46 - 03:49:50]
in that particular environment add

[03:49:47 - 03:49:52]
features give you output so many

[03:49:50 - 03:49:54]
operations will happen so this is the

[03:49:52 - 03:49:58]
overall picture and comparison between

[03:49:54 - 03:50:00]
the GPT 3.5 and 4 with the

[03:49:58 - 03:50:04]
interpretation option which is still in

[03:50:00 - 03:50:05]
the beta version right so let's end this

[03:50:04 - 03:50:08]
particular topic here let's check out

[03:50:05 - 03:50:12]
the next one how can we improvise our

[03:50:08 - 03:50:15]
code what do we do with Char GPT now the

[03:50:12 - 03:50:18]
next topic of char GPT of cod is let's

[03:50:15 - 03:50:22]
see debugging how do we do debugging

[03:50:18 - 03:50:25]
giving a wrong input to the chat GPT and

[03:50:22 - 03:50:28]
let's see whether the particular mistake

[03:50:25 - 03:50:30]
or the error has been detected or not so

[03:50:28 - 03:50:34]
let's proceed and check out our task to

[03:50:30 - 03:50:37]
execute in the Char GPT interface so

[03:50:34 - 03:50:40]
task number one I'm trying to copy or

[03:50:37 - 03:50:43]
type or paste this particular code which

[03:50:40 - 03:50:45]
is present here if you want to know what

[03:50:43 - 03:50:49]
is the error I can say it is an index

[03:50:45 - 03:50:51]
error actually let's see whether the GPT

[03:50:49 - 03:50:53]
will recognize the index error and uh

[03:50:51 - 03:50:55]
debug the program and provide corrected

[03:50:53 - 03:50:58]
output is the first prompt we will ask

[03:50:55 - 03:51:01]
the Char to and the second one is there

[03:50:58 - 03:51:02]
any other method which we can be used in

[03:51:01 - 03:51:05]
order to solve the same problem

[03:51:02 - 03:51:09]
statement so this also we will try to

[03:51:05 - 03:51:12]
ask the Char GPT interface in the

[03:51:09 - 03:51:14]
debugging aspect right after the

[03:51:12 - 03:51:16]
particular first example is completed

[03:51:14 - 03:51:19]
the same thing we can do with the second

[03:51:16 - 03:51:21]
example where let's check out what is

[03:51:19 - 03:51:24]
the error which is been put up here

[03:51:21 - 03:51:27]
right after the object I have not put

[03:51:24 - 03:51:30]
anything I just mentioned equals and I

[03:51:27 - 03:51:32]
just kept it blank so we paste the same

[03:51:30 - 03:51:34]
code in the GPT and let's check out how

[03:51:32 - 03:51:37]
does this work proceeding with the first

[03:51:34 - 03:51:39]
task now here we are in the GPT

[03:51:37 - 03:51:41]
interface if you want you can start off

[03:51:39 - 03:51:45]
with a new chat or you can continue here

[03:51:41 - 03:51:49]
itself so I prefer having a new chat so

[03:51:45 - 03:51:52]
I am pasting a error code here in GPT

[03:51:49 - 03:51:55]
3.5 right so you can execute in four

[03:51:52 - 03:52:01]
also but I prefer 3.5 for the

[03:51:55 - 03:52:06]
execution so I'll execute this

[03:52:01 - 03:52:07]
program find the error so let's see how

[03:52:06 - 03:52:09]
it will

[03:52:07 - 03:52:11]
execute the code you have provided

[03:52:09 - 03:52:15]
mostly correct but there is a potential

[03:52:11 - 03:52:17]
issue when printing the value using a F

[03:52:15 - 03:52:19]
string the curly braces in the F string

[03:52:17 - 03:52:22]
need to be formatted with the index

[03:52:19 - 03:52:26]
value so one of the curly braces was

[03:52:22 - 03:52:30]
missing here right so that is why it is

[03:52:26 - 03:52:33]
giving a corrected version program here

[03:52:30 - 03:52:36]
it is not telling us so you are not

[03:52:33 - 03:52:39]
wrong it is boosting our confidence that

[03:52:36 - 03:52:42]
you're mostly correct actually there is

[03:52:39 - 03:52:45]
a mistake here it's like how we correct

[03:52:42 - 03:52:47]
somebody as a uh teacher or a person who

[03:52:45 - 03:52:49]
wants to teach something to a person who

[03:52:47 - 03:52:52]
has made a mistake right we will try to

[03:52:49 - 03:52:56]
convince okay you have made your attempt

[03:52:52 - 03:52:59]
but your improvised code is so and so it

[03:52:56 - 03:53:03]
is trying to be human enough and it is

[03:52:59 - 03:53:06]
giving the output to the inputs provided

[03:53:03 - 03:53:08]
right so the corrected version is been

[03:53:06 - 03:53:11]
added here it is having indes that is

[03:53:08 - 03:53:15]
index to axis this was missing it is

[03:53:11 - 03:53:18]
giving the value here see index to axis

[03:53:15 - 03:53:20]
it is giving this particular mest

[03:53:18 - 03:53:23]
section and almost it was correct it was

[03:53:20 - 03:53:25]
not missing anything but it is just

[03:53:23 - 03:53:28]
trying to add and make the corrections

[03:53:25 - 03:53:32]
accordingly and mention this

[03:53:28 - 03:53:37]
particular error also here right so let

[03:53:32 - 03:53:41]
me check out with one more prompt uh let

[03:53:37 - 03:53:45]
me improvise this particular code

[03:53:41 - 03:53:49]
so any other method

[03:53:45 - 03:53:53]
we can solve the above

[03:53:49 - 03:53:57]
program right so Sly here there's an

[03:53:53 - 03:53:59]
alternative which is been provided so in

[03:53:57 - 03:54:01]
this version of code attempts to access

[03:53:59 - 03:54:04]
the value of the specified index within

[03:54:01 - 03:54:08]
the tri block if the index is out of

[03:54:04 - 03:54:10]
range it will raise an index error right

[03:54:08 - 03:54:14]
which is caught by the except block so

[03:54:10 - 03:54:17]
what it is trying to do it is using I

[03:54:14 - 03:54:21]
catch block where nothing was present

[03:54:17 - 03:54:24]
when I gave this particular code file so

[03:54:21 - 03:54:27]
it is telling we can improvise see it

[03:54:24 - 03:54:30]
improvised by adding if else it also

[03:54:27 - 03:54:33]
added one of the logic to the same

[03:54:30 - 03:54:36]
object the same input which is created

[03:54:33 - 03:54:38]
so if else is not there here so it added

[03:54:36 - 03:54:42]
if else it gave this particular

[03:54:38 - 03:54:45]
comparison also if you could see index

[03:54:42 - 03:54:47]
axis length with respect to that whether

[03:54:45 - 03:54:50]
to check the index is within bounds or

[03:54:47 - 03:54:53]
out of bounds it made this particular

[03:54:50 - 03:54:55]
logic also accessible and which was not

[03:54:53 - 03:54:57]
present here so these Corrections were

[03:54:55 - 03:54:59]
told to us and it is made after doing

[03:54:57 - 03:55:02]
all these things again it is having

[03:54:59 - 03:55:05]
exception handling right this is how the

[03:55:02 - 03:55:07]
particular error is detected given the

[03:55:05 - 03:55:09]
suggestion and improvise the particular

[03:55:07 - 03:55:12]
code which we have provided and it will

[03:55:09 - 03:55:14]
give the improvised modified updated

[03:55:12 - 03:55:17]
code for sback now let's let's check out

[03:55:14 - 03:55:21]
the second example the second example

[03:55:17 - 03:55:24]
let's paste that particular wrong code

[03:55:21 - 03:55:28]
itself and see what is missing something

[03:55:24 - 03:55:31]
is missing here let's ask find the

[03:55:28 - 03:55:32]
error if you don't ask also it will say

[03:55:31 - 03:55:34]
it seems like you want to create

[03:55:32 - 03:55:37]
instance of a subass and call the

[03:55:34 - 03:55:39]
overridden method so it is analyzing

[03:55:37 - 03:55:43]
what I'm trying to do I'm doing method

[03:55:39 - 03:55:45]
overriding actually and this is the

[03:55:43 - 03:55:48]
particular code this was missing

[03:55:45 - 03:55:53]
actually my subass was removed in order

[03:55:48 - 03:55:55]
to make a mistake and put that to charge

[03:55:53 - 03:55:57]
and ask for the correction obviously it

[03:55:55 - 03:55:59]
detected and it is given the corrected

[03:55:57 - 03:56:02]
code also right so it is giving the

[03:55:59 - 03:56:04]
explanation how it will work so any

[03:56:02 - 03:56:07]
other

[03:56:04 - 03:56:10]
method I just gave any other method it

[03:56:07 - 03:56:12]
normally I how I want to speak it is uh

[03:56:10 - 03:56:14]
giving the prompt like that only and it

[03:56:12 - 03:56:17]
is giving the output for us back

[03:56:14 - 03:56:20]
so yes that is a method you can approach

[03:56:17 - 03:56:22]
for by using super function right so it

[03:56:20 - 03:56:24]
is giving a modified code as well here

[03:56:22 - 03:56:25]
so this is how you debug your code if

[03:56:24 - 03:56:27]
you're struck somewhere if you are

[03:56:25 - 03:56:29]
trying to learn something or if you want

[03:56:27 - 03:56:31]
to solve something you have done half of

[03:56:29 - 03:56:34]
the work and you're not knowing how to

[03:56:31 - 03:56:37]
proceed you can upload the error code

[03:56:34 - 03:56:39]
into the chat GPT and try to ask chat

[03:56:37 - 03:56:42]
GPT what is the error how do you correct

[03:56:39 - 03:56:43]
it what is the modified code and any

[03:56:42 - 03:56:46]
other method you can improvise so

[03:56:43 - 03:56:48]
everything can be asked so this is how

[03:56:46 - 03:56:52]
debugging can be done for your programs

[03:56:48 - 03:56:56]
using chat GPT right now the next topic

[03:56:52 - 03:56:59]
is exception handling using chat GPT

[03:56:56 - 03:57:01]
right so we will provide chat GPT with

[03:56:59 - 03:57:04]
the codes which is not having exception

[03:57:01 - 03:57:06]
and then we will ask chbd to provide

[03:57:04 - 03:57:09]
exceptions and let's see how it will

[03:57:06 - 03:57:12]
respond let's check out the tasks in

[03:57:09 - 03:57:14]
order to execute in chat GPT

[03:57:12 - 03:57:17]
interface so the task one is I'm trying

[03:57:14 - 03:57:19]
to copy paste this particular code which

[03:57:17 - 03:57:21]
I'm using here into the chart jpt

[03:57:19 - 03:57:23]
interface and find the type of the error

[03:57:21 - 03:57:27]
and add an exception for the above code

[03:57:23 - 03:57:29]
and then to handle any decimal index

[03:57:27 - 03:57:32]
value I'm using the same particular

[03:57:29 - 03:57:36]
program which I was using that is the

[03:57:32 - 03:57:37]
index value error program but already we

[03:57:36 - 03:57:40]
have seen the chart GPT has given

[03:57:37 - 03:57:43]
exception to improvise the code when we

[03:57:40 - 03:57:45]
asked in the previous execution but now

[03:57:43 - 03:57:48]
we will try to reexecute and check the

[03:57:45 - 03:57:50]
first thing is I'm trying to ask what is

[03:57:48 - 03:57:51]
the error and I'm trying to add

[03:57:50 - 03:57:55]
exception handling for that particular

[03:57:51 - 03:57:57]
code and then I'm having a customized

[03:57:55 - 03:58:01]
exception handling that is when a user

[03:57:57 - 03:58:06]
will give uh like index value like

[03:58:01 - 03:58:08]
decimals 0.1 0.2 so on and so forth what

[03:58:06 - 03:58:11]
we do and how to handle that so we'll

[03:58:08 - 03:58:14]
ask these questions to chat gbt let's

[03:58:11 - 03:58:18]
see what is the response now let's see

[03:58:14 - 03:58:21]
the next task that is Task number two we

[03:58:18 - 03:58:24]
paste this particular code that is zero

[03:58:21 - 03:58:26]
division error and ask for the exception

[03:58:24 - 03:58:29]
it will find the error and provide the

[03:58:26 - 03:58:31]
exception and then we will ask any other

[03:58:29 - 03:58:34]
logic in order to solve this program

[03:58:31 - 03:58:36]
right these two tasks will perform with

[03:58:34 - 03:58:39]
respect to exception handling using chat

[03:58:36 - 03:58:41]
GPT let's switch on to the interface now

[03:58:39 - 03:58:44]
I can use the new chat so I'm pressing

[03:58:41 - 03:58:47]
on the new chat here in the left and uh

[03:58:44 - 03:58:50]
I'm trying to paste a codee which is

[03:58:47 - 03:58:53]
having index value error issue and ask

[03:58:50 - 03:58:56]
an exception to this particular code and

[03:58:53 - 03:59:00]
get the modified code so I'm just giving

[03:58:56 - 03:59:01]
a normal code and it says it looks like

[03:59:00 - 03:59:03]
you have provided a simple python

[03:59:01 - 03:59:06]
snippet that creates a list of a

[03:59:03 - 03:59:08]
containing five elements and then

[03:59:06 - 03:59:11]
prompts the user to put the input to the

[03:59:08 - 03:59:13]
index the code and then access the value

[03:59:11 - 03:59:15]
and it will print the index for the same

[03:59:13 - 03:59:20]
if you have any questions about the code

[03:59:15 - 03:59:27]
you can ask me so what it is Ping is

[03:59:20 - 03:59:31]
what is the error that can happen in the

[03:59:27 - 03:59:33]
code above so I'm asking a question what

[03:59:31 - 03:59:35]
might be the error obviously the code

[03:59:33 - 03:59:38]
you have provided these are the errors

[03:59:35 - 03:59:40]
it can happen input type error and index

[03:59:38 - 03:59:44]
error it is giving explanation also in

[03:59:40 - 03:59:48]
order to solve this particular uh error

[03:59:44 - 03:59:50]
you can use try except block right

[03:59:48 - 03:59:52]
without us asking provide exception

[03:59:50 - 03:59:55]
handling for this above code I'm just

[03:59:52 - 03:59:57]
asking what is the error it might come

[03:59:55 - 04:00:00]
if at all if it wants to how do you

[03:59:57 - 04:00:03]
handle it is giving the complete try

[04:00:00 - 04:00:08]
except Block in this particular modified

[04:00:03 - 04:00:10]
code right so let's ask our customized

[04:00:08 - 04:00:15]
exception handling question what it was

[04:00:10 - 04:00:15]
discussed if user

[04:00:16 - 04:00:22]
provides decimal index

[04:00:19 - 04:00:26]
value as

[04:00:22 - 04:00:28]
input how to handle so I'm just asking

[04:00:26 - 04:00:31]
my own question in my normal language

[04:00:28 - 04:00:33]
without any sentence Framing and it is

[04:00:31 - 04:00:36]
trying to understand and give me the

[04:00:33 - 04:00:39]
output right so what it is s suggesting

[04:00:36 - 04:00:42]
us to do we will convert the floating

[04:00:39 - 04:00:44]
Point indexes to the decimal value and

[04:00:42 - 04:00:46]
then we will execute the program the

[04:00:44 - 04:00:50]
first conversion is happening then it is

[04:00:46 - 04:00:53]
proceeding right so this is how it will

[04:00:50 - 04:00:55]
convert right if you want to execute

[04:00:53 - 04:00:57]
this particular program and check how it

[04:00:55 - 04:00:59]
will work and if you're having Premier

[04:00:57 - 04:01:01]
version of chat GPT then you can copy

[04:00:59 - 04:01:04]
this paste in the gp4 and try to use The

[04:01:01 - 04:01:08]
Interpreter feature in the chat gp4

[04:01:04 - 04:01:11]
right so for now I'm stopping it here

[04:01:08 - 04:01:14]
that we have got the answers exactly how

[04:01:11 - 04:01:16]
we wanted and the GPT has UND stood our

[04:01:14 - 04:01:17]
problem statement it is suggested what

[04:01:16 - 04:01:19]
all the problems can arise the errors

[04:01:17 - 04:01:22]
can arise and how do you solve that with

[04:01:19 - 04:01:24]
the help of exception handing program

[04:01:22 - 04:01:25]
and then again if you give a customized

[04:01:24 - 04:01:27]
exception hand to be handled it is

[04:01:25 - 04:01:30]
providing the program for that as well

[04:01:27 - 04:01:32]
right so let's check out the second task

[04:01:30 - 04:01:34]
and let's paste the code which is having

[04:01:32 - 04:01:37]
zero index error and just work how it

[04:01:34 - 04:01:39]
will take it coming up to the second

[04:01:37 - 04:01:44]
task we are having a program here which

[04:01:39 - 04:01:47]
is having the zero division error right

[04:01:44 - 04:01:50]
so when you have this error let's see

[04:01:47 - 04:01:53]
what it will do the code you have

[04:01:50 - 04:01:55]
provided will incede cause zero division

[04:01:53 - 04:01:58]
error because you are trying to divide

[04:01:55 - 04:02:03]
by zero denominator is zero numerator is

[04:01:58 - 04:02:05]
10 so this is your program with error if

[04:02:03 - 04:02:08]
you run you will get this output if you

[04:02:05 - 04:02:10]
get that output how do you solve that

[04:02:08 - 04:02:14]
you can use this particular eel

[04:02:10 - 04:02:17]
statement else I can say

[04:02:14 - 04:02:21]
please add

[04:02:17 - 04:02:24]
exception for above code it tried

[04:02:21 - 04:02:27]
solving by using IF Els but I want

[04:02:24 - 04:02:29]
exception so let me ask please add

[04:02:27 - 04:02:34]
exception for above code it will give

[04:02:29 - 04:02:35]
you try and accept block right so any

[04:02:34 - 04:02:41]
other

[04:02:35 - 04:02:44]
method to solve the above

[04:02:41 - 04:02:46]
statement or problem let me give it as

[04:02:44 - 04:02:49]
problem

[04:02:46 - 04:02:53]
here so when you do

[04:02:49 - 04:02:57]
this it is telling are giving certainly

[04:02:53 - 04:03:00]
there is another way to divide this

[04:02:57 - 04:03:02]
particular 10 numerator with the

[04:03:00 - 04:03:06]
denominator zero even though if you get

[04:03:02 - 04:03:09]
a zero division error how do you solve

[04:03:06 - 04:03:13]
it so this is what it is it is giving

[04:03:09 - 04:03:16]
you the overall picture first we tried

[04:03:13 - 04:03:18]
hand link asking what is the error just

[04:03:16 - 04:03:21]
we didn't ask anything we just pasted

[04:03:18 - 04:03:22]
the code it gave us the what error and

[04:03:21 - 04:03:24]
it also gave the solution for us we

[04:03:22 - 04:03:27]
didn't want a defs we wanted exception

[04:03:24 - 04:03:29]
we asked for exception it provided the

[04:03:27 - 04:03:31]
exception and any other method if we can

[04:03:29 - 04:03:33]
solve this major problem statement if

[04:03:31 - 04:03:36]
you could see it is repeating the same

[04:03:33 - 04:03:39]
code what it suggested in if Els right

[04:03:36 - 04:03:41]
here if you could see here as a solution

[04:03:39 - 04:03:43]
it is repeating the same as another way

[04:03:41 - 04:03:45]
it is going to and fro a lot right

[04:03:43 - 04:03:48]
there's no much options it will start

[04:03:45 - 04:03:49]
going to and from right so this is all

[04:03:48 - 04:03:52]
about

[04:03:49 - 04:03:56]
debugging your code programs by using

[04:03:52 - 04:03:58]
chat GPT the next topic is testing using

[04:03:56 - 04:04:00]
chat GPT so the code which you have

[04:03:58 - 04:04:02]
created you want to test your code how

[04:04:00 - 04:04:05]
do you do that so we'll be doing that

[04:04:02 - 04:04:09]
with the help of testing and it can be

[04:04:05 - 04:04:11]
taken up in ch gbt interface so prompt

[04:04:09 - 04:04:13]
number one what we will execute we try

[04:04:11 - 04:04:15]
to do the unit test for the above code

[04:04:13 - 04:04:17]
any code which we have already executed

[04:04:15 - 04:04:20]
we'll take that into consideration and

[04:04:17 - 04:04:22]
we will try to execute so the problem

[04:04:20 - 04:04:25]
number two suggest code Improvement

[04:04:22 - 04:04:27]
ideas for the above code and Implement

[04:04:25 - 04:04:31]
any of the idea and provide the code

[04:04:27 - 04:04:34]
right so ideas will be given and out of

[04:04:31 - 04:04:37]
that we will ask you can Implement so

[04:04:34 - 04:04:40]
and so it will give the output

[04:04:37 - 04:04:42]
accordingly so let's check out this

[04:04:40 - 04:04:44]
particular testing how we can carry out

[04:04:42 - 04:04:47]
in ch GPT

[04:04:44 - 04:04:51]
interface here we are in the chart GPT

[04:04:47 - 04:04:55]
interface and I'll try to add a

[04:04:51 - 04:04:59]
code and ask the chart

[04:04:55 - 04:05:01]
GPT to provide the unit testing so what

[04:04:59 - 04:05:04]
it has done is as soon as you add and

[04:05:01 - 04:05:07]
you give nothing as an input except the

[04:05:04 - 04:05:09]
code you don't ask to perform any other

[04:05:07 - 04:05:11]
operation it will break the particular

[04:05:09 - 04:05:14]
program and try to explain you line by

[04:05:11 - 04:05:17]
line what is happening right so after

[04:05:14 - 04:05:20]
this we will try to

[04:05:17 - 04:05:22]
ask

[04:05:20 - 04:05:28]
perform unit

[04:05:22 - 04:05:31]
testing on the code above right when you

[04:05:28 - 04:05:34]
ask this sure I can provide you on the

[04:05:31 - 04:05:36]
code above this is the unit testing

[04:05:34 - 04:05:39]
which we can perform you have the code

[04:05:36 - 04:05:42]
right here right away right it is giving

[04:05:39 - 04:05:46]
the example and the explanation for the

[04:05:42 - 04:05:52]
example right below the code right so

[04:05:46 - 04:05:57]
this is how you do the unit testing

[04:05:52 - 04:06:00]
so any other testing options

[04:05:57 - 04:06:02]
available these are all generalized chat

[04:06:00 - 04:06:05]
GPT prompts which I'm trying to ask my

[04:06:02 - 04:06:08]
single doubts which I get while I

[04:06:05 - 04:06:11]
execute I'll try to ask the same to the

[04:06:08 - 04:06:13]
interface yes certainly there are other

[04:06:11 - 04:06:15]
testing options also available except

[04:06:13 - 04:06:18]
unit test T in framework you have many

[04:06:15 - 04:06:20]
other options available apart from unit

[04:06:18 - 04:06:24]
testing the first one is py test second

[04:06:20 - 04:06:27]
one is dock test so all this modular

[04:06:24 - 04:06:31]
testing is also going through here right

[04:06:27 - 04:06:31]
so any other

[04:06:32 - 04:06:37]
options

[04:06:35 - 04:06:40]
available to

[04:06:37 - 04:06:43]
solve the code

[04:06:40 - 04:06:47]
above I'm just asking the question it is

[04:06:43 - 04:06:50]
giving the answer here for us with a

[04:06:47 - 04:06:54]
different type of solution and change

[04:06:50 - 04:06:56]
logic right so let me ask the same thing

[04:06:54 - 04:06:58]
what is the

[04:06:56 - 04:07:00]
efficiency of the

[04:06:58 - 04:07:04]
code

[04:07:00 - 04:07:09]
above so when you ask this question it

[04:07:04 - 04:07:12]
is giving us the efficiency of

[04:07:09 - 04:07:15]
this operations being performed and size

[04:07:12 - 04:07:18]
of the input list it depends upon that

[04:07:15 - 04:07:20]
so this is the

[04:07:18 - 04:07:24]
particular

[04:07:20 - 04:07:27]
efficiency list it has been given with

[04:07:24 - 04:07:31]
space complexity time complexity and

[04:07:27 - 04:07:37]
every aspect right so this is how you do

[04:07:31 - 04:07:40]
testing with the help of chat GPT and

[04:07:37 - 04:07:43]
you can also find the various programs

[04:07:40 - 04:07:45]
option and you can also Find the Errors

[04:07:43 - 04:07:47]
if you want to you can do unit testing

[04:07:45 - 04:07:49]
apart from unit testing you can

[04:07:47 - 04:07:52]
Implement dock test P test you have many

[04:07:49 - 04:07:55]
other options if you go on exploring

[04:07:52 - 04:07:59]
right so what I'm trying to say here is

[04:07:55 - 04:08:02]
you can start from building your program

[04:07:59 - 04:08:05]
to get to your desired output everything

[04:08:02 - 04:08:07]
can be done with the help of chat gpg we

[04:08:05 - 04:08:10]
saw one by one we started building the

[04:08:07 - 04:08:13]
program we started debugging the program

[04:08:10 - 04:08:16]
we started having the exception handling

[04:08:13 - 04:08:19]
inside the program and we also got into

[04:08:16 - 04:08:22]
the testing of the code right so it is

[04:08:19 - 04:08:24]
catering to every stage of one single

[04:08:22 - 04:08:27]
program or application development which

[04:08:24 - 04:08:30]
can be done with the help of chat GPT it

[04:08:27 - 04:08:33]
can be a greater support for anyone who

[04:08:30 - 04:08:36]
is learning programming or anyone who is

[04:08:33 - 04:08:38]
expert and they want to explore more on

[04:08:36 - 04:08:41]
both the aspects chat GPT will help for

[04:08:38 - 04:08:44]
the coders and the non-coders as well

[04:08:41 - 04:08:49]
right so this is this is all about the

[04:08:44 - 04:08:51]
testing your code over chat GPT now we

[04:08:49 - 04:08:55]
are in the next topic extra uses of chat

[04:08:51 - 04:08:58]
GPT apart from building a code from the

[04:08:55 - 04:09:00]
scratch up to the testing mode what all

[04:08:58 - 04:09:03]
the chart GPT can do apart from these

[04:09:00 - 04:09:06]
things we have several prompts examples

[04:09:03 - 04:09:08]
here first we will try to access the

[04:09:06 - 04:09:10]
code documentation for the code which is

[04:09:08 - 04:09:11]
already existing and suggest any

[04:09:10 - 04:09:13]
Improvement ideas we have been working

[04:09:11 - 04:09:15]
for this and it is been suggesting it is

[04:09:13 - 04:09:17]
already done but still we will do it

[04:09:15 - 04:09:20]
again Implement any other idea and

[04:09:17 - 04:09:22]
provide the code right we are just

[04:09:20 - 04:09:25]
asking a open ended question Implement

[04:09:22 - 04:09:27]
something and give me the modified code

[04:09:25 - 04:09:30]
and we have one more prompt here create

[04:09:27 - 04:09:34]
a dummy spreadsheet with four columns

[04:09:30 - 04:09:36]
and fill it with 10 rows of dummy data

[04:09:34 - 04:09:41]
format the resulting spreadsheet data as

[04:09:36 - 04:09:44]
a table we'll check both in GPT 3.5 and

[04:09:41 - 04:09:48]
4 right we will do this fourth prompt in

[04:09:44 - 04:09:51]
both of it right let's shift to char GPT

[04:09:48 - 04:09:52]
interface now I'm trying to continue the

[04:09:51 - 04:09:56]
same

[04:09:52 - 04:09:58]
thing kindly

[04:09:56 - 04:10:01]
provide code

[04:09:58 - 04:10:04]
documentation I'm trying to provide one

[04:10:01 - 04:10:06]
more prompt for the existing code file

[04:10:04 - 04:10:10]
here kindly provide code documentation

[04:10:06 - 04:10:10]
it is an extra prompt which I'm

[04:10:12 - 04:10:19]
running so when I give this it will give

[04:10:15 - 04:10:21]
you the complete code documentation here

[04:10:19 - 04:10:23]
it's going on certainly code

[04:10:21 - 04:10:25]
documentation is essential to make your

[04:10:23 - 04:10:26]
code understandable to others so this is

[04:10:25 - 04:10:29]
how it is the documentation is done

[04:10:26 - 04:10:33]
inside the code in the comments right

[04:10:29 - 04:10:36]
and it is given the summary at the right

[04:10:33 - 04:10:39]
bottom right so this is how the code

[04:10:36 - 04:10:42]
documentation will happen if if you ask

[04:10:39 - 04:10:44]
if you don't ask you will have the

[04:10:42 - 04:10:46]
comments but only limit comments if you

[04:10:44 - 04:10:51]
ask for code documentation it will give

[04:10:46 - 04:10:54]
you the complete picture right

[04:10:51 - 04:10:55]
next any

[04:10:54 - 04:11:00]
other

[04:10:55 - 04:11:04]
code can we

[04:11:00 - 04:11:08]
integrate to improvise

[04:11:04 - 04:11:11]
the code above it's a

[04:11:08 - 04:11:14]
random chart GPT prompt which I'm trying

[04:11:11 - 04:11:17]
to explore right how far we can

[04:11:14 - 04:11:18]
reach right certainly there are various

[04:11:17 - 04:11:20]
improvements and enhancements you can do

[04:11:18 - 04:11:22]
for the code which is mentioned above

[04:11:20 - 04:11:25]
input validation can be done one thing

[04:11:22 - 04:11:27]
Dynamic list you can give and error

[04:11:25 - 04:11:29]
handling in the main you can put custom

[04:11:27 - 04:11:32]
exceptions you can make so these are the

[04:11:29 - 04:11:36]
four options which it has provided right

[04:11:32 - 04:11:36]
so any other method

[04:11:39 - 04:11:46]
available I'm just asking the questions

[04:11:42 - 04:11:47]
if any other method we can go for it is

[04:11:46 - 04:11:50]
going with a simple condition

[04:11:47 - 04:11:53]
alternative method right so this is

[04:11:50 - 04:11:57]
about how do you do

[04:11:53 - 04:11:58]
extra work with the CH GPD even the

[04:11:57 - 04:12:00]
documentation is sorted with the help of

[04:11:58 - 04:12:03]
CH GPD for the code or the application

[04:12:00 - 04:12:07]
of the project which you work on right

[04:12:03 - 04:12:10]
so now we'll execute the fourth prompt I

[04:12:07 - 04:12:13]
prefer taking a new chat for this now

[04:12:10 - 04:12:14]
let's execute the fourth prompt which I

[04:12:13 - 04:12:16]
was

[04:12:14 - 04:12:20]
discussing now we'll execute that first

[04:12:16 - 04:12:22]
in 3.5 GPD so I'm asking a dummy

[04:12:20 - 04:12:26]
spreadsheet with four columns which is

[04:12:22 - 04:12:30]
having name age income and City and 10

[04:12:26 - 04:12:33]
rows of dummy data to be put up in a

[04:12:30 - 04:12:37]
spreadsheet table so let's

[04:12:33 - 04:12:40]
see it is telling I am a text based

[04:12:37 - 04:12:41]
artificial intelligence so I cannot

[04:12:40 - 04:12:44]
directly create visual elements like

[04:12:41 - 04:12:47]
spreadsheets however I can give you the

[04:12:44 - 04:12:49]
table which is displayed over here you

[04:12:47 - 04:12:51]
can what you can do with that also it is

[04:12:49 - 04:12:55]
telling you can use Microsoft Excel or

[04:12:51 - 04:13:00]
Google Sheets in order to get it into

[04:12:55 - 04:13:03]
a particular format right so the format

[04:13:00 - 04:13:05]
in the DAT table can be put up in Excel

[04:13:03 - 04:13:07]
or Sheets if you want to choose Excel

[04:13:05 - 04:13:09]
what you have to do select the data go

[04:13:07 - 04:13:13]
to insert button in the ribbon and click

[04:13:09 - 04:13:16]
on the table and you can just make sure

[04:13:13 - 04:13:19]
you create a table dialogue box and you

[04:13:16 - 04:13:22]
have table headers and click okay right

[04:13:19 - 04:13:24]
so it is giving you an option I am not

[04:13:22 - 04:13:28]
able to do this whatever you asked for

[04:13:24 - 04:13:31]
downloadable Excel format or anything

[04:13:28 - 04:13:33]
but I am a text based person and I can

[04:13:31 - 04:13:36]
just give you the details here but you

[04:13:33 - 04:13:38]
can proceed making a separate Excel or

[04:13:36 - 04:13:40]
Google sheet file this is how it is

[04:13:38 - 04:13:44]
giving the output for given input by the

[04:13:40 - 04:13:46]
user now I'll go into new chart and

[04:13:44 - 04:13:49]
select chart GPT 4 now we are in the

[04:13:46 - 04:13:52]
chart GPT 4 and pasting the same prompt

[04:13:49 - 04:13:54]
which we executed in 3.5 and let's see

[04:13:52 - 04:13:57]
what it will tell

[04:13:54 - 04:14:00]
us it is

[04:13:57 - 04:14:03]
working in the code interpretor

[04:14:00 - 04:14:06]
format which I have chosen to

[04:14:03 - 04:14:08]
do let's see what it will give the

[04:14:06 - 04:14:09]
output again we'll switch off the code

[04:14:08 - 04:14:12]
interpreter and check once more how it

[04:14:09 - 04:14:14]
will work right overall we are

[04:14:12 - 04:14:17]
experimenting in this particular uh

[04:14:14 - 04:14:21]
program or in this particular video what

[04:14:17 - 04:14:25]
all it can do so here is the dummy data

[04:14:21 - 04:14:27]
table it is providing us after execution

[04:14:25 - 04:14:30]
so let's see let it complete all the 10

[04:14:27 - 04:14:32]
rows and what it will suggest us to do

[04:14:30 - 04:14:36]
whether it is downloadable or

[04:14:32 - 04:14:39]
non-downloadable how can it be

[04:14:36 - 04:14:43]
done see that is the major difference

[04:14:39 - 04:14:45]
between GPT 3.5 and 4 it is giving the

[04:14:43 - 04:14:48]
downloadable CSV file with dummy data

[04:14:45 - 04:14:52]
access right so what did we ask for we

[04:14:48 - 04:14:54]
ask for a spreadsheet right

[04:14:52 - 04:14:58]
so I'm asking a question it's my own

[04:14:54 - 04:15:01]
doubt can we

[04:14:58 - 04:15:04]
get Excel

[04:15:01 - 04:15:04]
file

[04:15:06 - 04:15:10]
downloaded for the about

[04:15:11 - 04:15:18]
data so it's a non-grammatical how we

[04:15:16 - 04:15:20]
think how we write it's very different

[04:15:18 - 04:15:23]
so I've just given the prompt like that

[04:15:20 - 04:15:25]
let's see you can download the dummy

[04:15:23 - 04:15:27]
data and Excel format by clicking yes it

[04:15:25 - 04:15:30]
is giving you an Excel format also it is

[04:15:27 - 04:15:32]
giving you a CSV format also right so

[04:15:30 - 04:15:35]
this is one of

[04:15:32 - 04:15:38]
the plus point of using chat gp4 you can

[04:15:35 - 04:15:40]
have a downloadable data so one last

[04:15:38 - 04:15:43]
thing we want to experiment here which

[04:15:40 - 04:15:45]
we discussed is by switching of code

[04:15:43 - 04:15:49]
interpreter and just taking a default

[04:15:45 - 04:15:52]
chat gp4 so when you click this what

[04:15:49 - 04:15:55]
happens let's

[04:15:52 - 04:15:59]
see so it will try to execute yes this

[04:15:55 - 04:16:01]
is the table it gives you in the format

[04:15:59 - 04:16:04]
of plain

[04:16:01 - 04:16:07]
text so can you download let's wait and

[04:16:04 - 04:16:09]
watch it is just giving you copy code

[04:16:07 - 04:16:13]
you can have a copy option already

[04:16:09 - 04:16:16]
readily available here so let's see

[04:16:13 - 04:16:16]
after the 10th

[04:16:18 - 04:16:24]
entry can we

[04:16:21 - 04:16:28]
download the above

[04:16:24 - 04:16:30]
data so I'm just giving a prompt I'm

[04:16:28 - 04:16:32]
sorry but I'm unable to facilitate

[04:16:30 - 04:16:36]
direct file downloads you can copy the

[04:16:32 - 04:16:40]
text you can paste it in your notepad or

[04:16:36 - 04:16:43]
document or wherever the situated places

[04:16:40 - 04:16:46]
right so this is how

[04:16:43 - 04:16:49]
it will make some difference when you

[04:16:46 - 04:16:53]
have the same prompt executed in GPT 3.5

[04:16:49 - 04:16:56]
GPT 4 without code interpreter gp4 with

[04:16:53 - 04:17:00]
code interpreter option right so this is

[04:16:56 - 04:17:02]
all about the extra uses of chat GPT now

[04:17:00 - 04:17:05]
we are in the last topic of this

[04:17:02 - 04:17:07]
particular session coding limitations of

[04:17:05 - 04:17:10]
chat GPT I'm talking about the

[04:17:07 - 04:17:13]
limitation with respect to CH GPT 3.5

[04:17:10 - 04:17:17]
only Okay so

[04:17:13 - 04:17:20]
the first thing is lack of context

[04:17:17 - 04:17:22]
Beyond 2048 tokens

[04:17:20 - 04:17:25]
248

[04:17:22 - 04:17:29]
tokens after that you don't have any

[04:17:25 - 04:17:31]
context how it will work 3.5 so

[04:17:29 - 04:17:34]
generating incorrect responses at some

[04:17:31 - 04:17:36]
instances that happened right when we

[04:17:34 - 04:17:38]
tried executing different methods it

[04:17:36 - 04:17:40]
gave us the same method repeatedly again

[04:17:38 - 04:17:42]
as an alternative so it goes on

[04:17:40 - 04:17:44]
incorrect responses or it will goes on

[04:17:42 - 04:17:47]
on a Loop if doesn't find any other

[04:17:44 - 04:17:50]
options so sensitive content and

[04:17:47 - 04:17:52]
bias so verbosity and reputation it is

[04:17:50 - 04:17:54]
having lots of repetion again the same

[04:17:52 - 04:17:56]
logic has been repeated ever and ever

[04:17:54 - 04:17:59]
again lack of clarification for

[04:17:56 - 04:18:00]
ambiguous quedes so it will say I'm not

[04:17:59 - 04:18:03]
the right person to answer to your query

[04:18:00 - 04:18:05]
and you can do so and so options right

[04:18:03 - 04:18:07]
it will promptly accept that it is not

[04:18:05 - 04:18:09]
happening from it and it is giving an

[04:18:07 - 04:18:13]
option how do we explore and go ahead

[04:18:09 - 04:18:15]
about it so noncontextual responses also

[04:18:13 - 04:18:16]
sometimes it will provide domain

[04:18:15 - 04:18:19]
expertise and specific knowledge is

[04:18:16 - 04:18:20]
lacking a little bit not completely

[04:18:19 - 04:18:23]
available because it is trained up to

[04:18:20 - 04:18:25]
one level it's not beyond the level so

[04:18:23 - 04:18:28]
generating creative or fictional content

[04:18:25 - 04:18:31]
so it is having a generation capability

[04:18:28 - 04:18:34]
but only to The Limited extent not more

[04:18:31 - 04:18:35]
towards more Innovation more creativity

[04:18:34 - 04:18:38]
it's not available it is having certain

[04:18:35 - 04:18:40]
limitations as well not a replacement

[04:18:38 - 04:18:43]
for professional advice right every

[04:18:40 - 04:18:46]
aspect it might not think it might f to

[04:18:43 - 04:18:48]
think in every aspect human perspective

[04:18:46 - 04:18:50]
any other consequences perspective any

[04:18:48 - 04:18:53]
other situation oriented uh uh decisions

[04:18:50 - 04:18:55]
to be made so all this cannot happen

[04:18:53 - 04:18:57]
with the help of chat right Business

[04:18:55 - 04:19:00]
Solutions business management product

[04:18:57 - 04:19:02]
management operations management so

[04:19:00 - 04:19:04]
Inventory management all these things we

[04:19:02 - 04:19:06]
have to decide how the business is going

[04:19:04 - 04:19:09]
what it is happening human mind thinking

[04:19:06 - 04:19:12]
is very different than chat GPT thinking

[04:19:09 - 04:19:14]
it is not completely matching but it is

[04:19:12 - 04:19:17]
trying to match the thinking capacity as

[04:19:14 - 04:19:20]
well but always it is not the

[04:19:17 - 04:19:22]
replacement for professional advice so

[04:19:20 - 04:19:24]
unpredictable output sometimes it

[04:19:22 - 04:19:26]
happens it gives us unpredictable output

[04:19:24 - 04:19:29]
it is confusing it we can still ask

[04:19:26 - 04:19:31]
question and clarify but still as soon

[04:19:29 - 04:19:33]
as it gives you unpredictable outputs

[04:19:31 - 04:19:35]
it's very difficult to trace back if it

[04:19:33 - 04:19:37]
is a bigger program I'm talking about

[04:19:35 - 04:19:40]
bigger program aspect if it is a smaller

[04:19:37 - 04:19:44]
one Modular One it's completely fine we

[04:19:40 - 04:19:46]
can access it right so

[04:19:44 - 04:19:49]
these are the code limitations of chat

[04:19:46 - 04:19:52]
GPT 3.5 in

[04:19:49 - 04:19:55]
particular now here we are at the last

[04:19:52 - 04:19:57]
section of this session that is summary

[04:19:55 - 04:19:59]
let's have a quick recap of what all did

[04:19:57 - 04:20:05]
we study in this session the first thing

[04:19:59 - 04:20:08]
we studied what is the chat GPT role and

[04:20:05 - 04:20:09]
who is responsible to charge dpd to be

[04:20:08 - 04:20:11]
developed that is artificial

[04:20:09 - 04:20:14]
intelligence the major domain and the

[04:20:11 - 04:20:16]
subdomain is been discussed introductory

[04:20:14 - 04:20:18]
discussion happened after that we

[04:20:16 - 04:20:22]
started comparing the competitors that

[04:20:18 - 04:20:24]
is Char gbt and ghub co-pilot as well

[04:20:22 - 04:20:26]
what are the major differences with

[04:20:24 - 04:20:30]
respect to the premium axes response to

[04:20:26 - 04:20:32]
the proms train data set Etc programmers

[04:20:30 - 04:20:34]
and non-programmers who can use the chat

[04:20:32 - 04:20:37]
GPT if at all if they want to use what

[04:20:34 - 04:20:41]
are the pros and cons of using it right

[04:20:37 - 04:20:43]
we listed everything and then many other

[04:20:41 - 04:20:46]
prompts were demonstrated with respect

[04:20:43 - 04:20:49]
to building the codee debugging the code

[04:20:46 - 04:20:52]
handling the exceptions testing code

[04:20:49 - 04:20:55]
documentation all the demonstrations

[04:20:52 - 04:20:59]
were done apart from this we had extra

[04:20:55 - 04:21:02]
uses also we tried creating a table a

[04:20:59 - 04:21:05]
dummy data having certain entries inside

[04:21:02 - 04:21:08]
it and we also saw the differences how

[04:21:05 - 04:21:12]
the same prompt will be executed in GPT

[04:21:08 - 04:21:14]
3.5 and GPT 4 which is having access to

[04:21:12 - 04:21:18]
down load the file in gp4 which is not

[04:21:14 - 04:21:21]
present in 3.5 right so at last we saw a

[04:21:18 - 04:21:23]
few of the limitations with respect to

[04:21:21 - 04:21:26]
the architecture training data verbosity

[04:21:23 - 04:21:31]
reputation sensitive content be Etc in

[04:21:26 - 04:21:34]
chat GPT 3.5 by this we end the session

[04:21:31 - 04:21:37]
happy learning thank you now let us see

[04:21:34 - 04:21:40]
how to give the prompt to our chat

[04:21:37 - 04:21:43]
GPT I will start telling that I want to

[04:21:40 - 04:21:46]
build a game app that is rock paper

[04:21:43 - 04:21:50]
scissors let my back end be Python and

[04:21:46 - 04:21:53]
front end be HTML CSS and JavaScript I

[04:21:50 - 04:21:57]
want to execute this on an online editor

[04:21:53 - 04:22:00]
namely riplet so this is our instruction

[04:21:57 - 04:22:02]
constraint because here I'm telling chat

[04:22:00 - 04:22:06]
GPT that I want to develop a rock paper

[04:22:02 - 04:22:09]
Caesar game where python is my back end

[04:22:06 - 04:22:12]
and HTML CSS and JavaScript being my

[04:22:09 - 04:22:15]
front end so we are setting a context

[04:22:12 - 04:22:19]
next here so this is all about what we

[04:22:15 - 04:22:21]
want to develop next is I want this for

[04:22:19 - 04:22:24]
the target audience of college students

[04:22:21 - 04:22:27]
and it should be for early professionals

[04:22:24 - 04:22:29]
as well so let it be simple and easy to

[04:22:27 - 04:22:32]
execute so this is where I am setting my

[04:22:29 - 04:22:35]
audience pattern and the overall context

[04:22:32 - 04:22:38]
is set here then let the creation of

[04:22:35 - 04:22:42]
this be very interactive and with simple

[04:22:38 - 04:22:44]
explanation and a stepbystep process

[04:22:42 - 04:22:46]
which helps me understand and create

[04:22:44 - 04:22:49]
these easily so this is our overall

[04:22:46 - 04:22:51]
context that we are setting here so I

[04:22:49 - 04:22:55]
want it to be very interactive so that

[04:22:51 - 04:22:57]
it'll tell me what to do stepwise then

[04:22:55 - 04:23:01]
please help me connect both front end

[04:22:57 - 04:23:03]
and backend codes easily and explain

[04:23:01 - 04:23:06]
everything from scratch so this is again

[04:23:03 - 04:23:08]
an instruction so this is my

[04:23:06 - 04:23:12]
entire prompt which I want to give it to

[04:23:08 - 04:23:16]
my chat GPT so I will copy paste this PR

[04:23:12 - 04:23:17]
prompt to my chat GPT here so I will go

[04:23:16 - 04:23:20]
to my chat

[04:23:17 - 04:23:22]
GPT and I will give my prompt if you

[04:23:20 - 04:23:24]
want to know more about how to write

[04:23:22 - 04:23:26]
these prompts in detail you can take up

[04:23:24 - 04:23:29]
a course from our great learning

[04:23:26 - 04:23:31]
platform and it is prompt

[04:23:29 - 04:23:34]
engineering so now let us execute this

[04:23:31 - 04:23:38]
prompt when I give this prompt so this

[04:23:34 - 04:23:40]
is what chat GPT gives me back so sure

[04:23:38 - 04:23:43]
let's create an interactive rock paper

[04:23:40 - 04:23:46]
Caesar app using flask at the back end

[04:23:43 - 04:23:48]
and HTML CSS Java for the front end here

[04:23:46 - 04:23:51]
it's giving me step by-step guide to

[04:23:48 - 04:23:55]
follow so it is telling me to sign in or

[04:23:51 - 04:23:58]
login to ret.com I will show you a demo

[04:23:55 - 04:24:01]
of how the prompt decoding Works in a

[04:23:58 - 04:24:04]
moment but first let's go through the

[04:24:01 - 04:24:08]
basic setup for our front end we are

[04:24:04 - 04:24:10]
using HTML to structure our game CSS to

[04:24:08 - 04:24:13]
style it and JavaScript to add

[04:24:10 - 04:24:15]
interactivity HTM L will help us create

[04:24:13 - 04:24:18]
the grid for the rock paper scissors

[04:24:15 - 04:24:21]
game CSS will make it look appealing and

[04:24:18 - 04:24:24]
JavaScript will handle the game logic

[04:24:21 - 04:24:27]
such as detecting clicks and revealing

[04:24:24 - 04:24:30]
winners on the back end we will be using

[04:24:27 - 04:24:33]
flask a lightweight python web framework

[04:24:30 - 04:24:36]
flask will serve our frontend files and

[04:24:33 - 04:24:39]
handle the game logic on the server side

[04:24:36 - 04:24:42]
this setup allows us to build a fully

[04:24:39 - 04:24:44]
functional web app with python we are

[04:24:42 - 04:24:48]
going going to use riplet an online code

[04:24:44 - 04:24:51]
Editor to run write and test our code

[04:24:48 - 04:24:54]
riplet makes it easy to collaborate and

[04:24:51 - 04:24:56]
share your projects with

[04:24:54 - 04:24:58]
others now I will walk you through the

[04:24:56 - 04:25:02]
steps of building the rock paper

[04:24:58 - 04:25:05]
scissors game we will start by setting

[04:25:02 - 04:25:07]
up the front end files then move on to

[04:25:05 - 04:25:11]
the back end with flask and finally

[04:25:07 - 04:25:13]
connect everything together so here I

[04:25:11 - 04:25:15]
can go to Google and I can log in into

[04:25:13 - 04:25:17]
my reple account I have already logged

[04:25:15 - 04:25:21]
in so you can create one account for

[04:25:17 - 04:25:23]
your own so this is my reple account

[04:25:21 - 04:25:26]
next it is telling me to create a new

[04:25:23 - 04:25:28]
project so it is telling me to click on

[04:25:26 - 04:25:31]
the create button and choose flask as

[04:25:28 - 04:25:34]
the template so I can go and click on

[04:25:31 - 04:25:37]
the create replate option here I should

[04:25:34 - 04:25:39]
select flask as an option that is your

[04:25:37 - 04:25:42]
template now I have to give a title to

[04:25:39 - 04:25:43]
it so what can we give we can give it as

[04:25:42 - 04:25:45]
rock

[04:25:43 - 04:25:47]
paper

[04:25:45 - 04:25:53]
Caesar

[04:25:47 - 04:25:53]
game app okay so now create

[04:25:54 - 04:26:01]
replate now once you click on create it

[04:25:56 - 04:26:04]
will open a new page for us so now here

[04:26:01 - 04:26:06]
we will be copy pasting our code so

[04:26:04 - 04:26:08]
we'll see what is our next step our next

[04:26:06 - 04:26:11]
step is to set up the back end that is

[04:26:08 - 04:26:14]
python with flask so we have to open

[04:26:11 - 04:26:16]
main.py and copy this code that is your

[04:26:14 - 04:26:20]
python code so click on copy code here

[04:26:16 - 04:26:23]
go to your dlet so this is our main.py

[04:26:20 - 04:26:27]
so here I am copy pasting my code which

[04:26:23 - 04:26:30]
I have got it from chat GPT next after

[04:26:27 - 04:26:32]
this step it is telling us the step

[04:26:30 - 04:26:34]
three that is to set up the front end so

[04:26:32 - 04:26:37]
to set up the front end we have to

[04:26:34 - 04:26:40]
create templates folder first so let me

[04:26:37 - 04:26:42]
go back and I in main P now and here

[04:26:40 - 04:26:47]
there is an option of new folder so

[04:26:42 - 04:26:51]
click on this new folder and name it as

[04:26:47 - 04:26:54]
templates okay now it is also telling me

[04:26:51 - 04:26:56]
create a new folder name templates

[04:26:54 - 04:26:58]
inside this folder we have to create a

[04:26:56 - 04:27:01]
file named

[04:26:58 - 04:27:03]
index.html so I'll copy the same name

[04:27:01 - 04:27:07]
and I'll go back and here it is telling

[04:27:03 - 04:27:10]
me file so I will copy paste my HTML uh

[04:27:07 - 04:27:14]
file now so I have created an index.

[04:27:10 - 04:27:16]
HTML file now next after creating it it

[04:27:14 - 04:27:20]
is telling me to add HTML code so I will

[04:27:16 - 04:27:24]
just copy this code and I will paste it

[04:27:20 - 04:27:27]
here in my HTML file that is index. HTML

[04:27:24 - 04:27:29]
okay we'll see what we have to do next

[04:27:27 - 04:27:33]
next it is telling me to create static

[04:27:29 - 04:27:36]
folder so I'll go back on the

[04:27:33 - 04:27:38]
main.py click on main.py again create a

[04:27:36 - 04:27:41]
new folder by name

[04:27:38 - 04:27:44]
static okay and inside that we have to

[04:27:41 - 04:27:51]
create two files now so one is style.

[04:27:44 - 04:27:54]
CSS I will name a file as static. CSS so

[04:27:51 - 04:27:57]
now after naming my uh one file name as

[04:27:54 - 04:28:01]
CSS other file name is

[04:27:57 - 04:28:04]
script.js I will create another

[04:28:01 - 04:28:06]
file inside

[04:28:04 - 04:28:07]
this by

[04:28:06 - 04:28:10]
name

[04:28:07 - 04:28:13]
script.js I have created two files

[04:28:10 - 04:28:16]
inside static folder now so

[04:28:13 - 04:28:20]
now I have to add CSS code so I have to

[04:28:16 - 04:28:24]
copy my CSS code and I will go to my CSS

[04:28:20 - 04:28:27]
file and I will paste the code here

[04:28:24 - 04:28:29]
next next it is telling me to add the

[04:28:27 - 04:28:32]
JavaScript code so let me copy the

[04:28:29 - 04:28:35]
JavaScript code from here and I will

[04:28:32 - 04:28:38]
click on the Javascript file and let me

[04:28:35 - 04:28:40]
paste my code here next we will see what

[04:28:38 - 04:28:44]
it is telling so step four is nothing

[04:28:40 - 04:28:47]
but running the application on riplet so

[04:28:44 - 04:28:50]
before we run in our into our execution

[04:28:47 - 04:28:52]
let us see uh the main gist of what

[04:28:50 - 04:28:55]
these files are now so this is the

[04:28:52 - 04:28:57]
python file where you are setting the

[04:28:55 - 04:29:00]
actual context where it is actually

[04:28:57 - 04:29:03]
playing rock paper Caesars and all of

[04:29:00 - 04:29:05]
that taking the input from the user HTML

[04:29:03 - 04:29:08]
file where it is used for structuring

[04:29:05 - 04:29:11]
your code so your entire web page will

[04:29:08 - 04:29:14]
be set up using this HTML structure then

[04:29:11 - 04:29:17]
is your CSS where you are styling your

[04:29:14 - 04:29:18]
entire web page and then is your

[04:29:17 - 04:29:21]
JavaScript which helps you to

[04:29:18 - 04:29:24]
interactively connect everything on your

[04:29:21 - 04:29:27]
code that you are developed so now once

[04:29:24 - 04:29:29]
you understand it just about it it are

[04:29:27 - 04:29:31]
we will move on to our step four that is

[04:29:29 - 04:29:34]
your running the application on riplet

[04:29:31 - 04:29:37]
so to run we have to just click the Run

[04:29:34 - 04:29:39]
button on top of the riplet then you can

[04:29:37 - 04:29:44]
access the game as what it is telling so

[04:29:39 - 04:29:44]
now I will go here and I will run

[04:29:45 - 04:29:51]
so when I run this code you can see that

[04:29:49 - 04:29:54]
you have got an output so it is telling

[04:29:51 - 04:29:56]
rock paper Caesar so if I click on Rock

[04:29:54 - 04:29:59]
it'll tell you chose Rock but computer

[04:29:56 - 04:30:02]
also chose Rock so it is a tie so when I

[04:29:59 - 04:30:04]
click paper you choose paper but

[04:30:02 - 04:30:06]
computer choose Rock so you win so this

[04:30:04 - 04:30:08]
is how you can get the output for a

[04:30:06 - 04:30:11]
single player computer being your

[04:30:08 - 04:30:13]
another player so now we will actually

[04:30:11 - 04:30:17]
Define our code I mean we will refine

[04:30:13 - 04:30:20]
our code using chat GPT better for two

[04:30:17 - 04:30:23]
players so I am just giving the prompt

[04:30:20 - 04:30:26]
as rock paper Caesar should be for two

[04:30:23 - 04:30:28]
person game so when I give this prompt

[04:30:26 - 04:30:30]
here again it'll refine the code and it

[04:30:28 - 04:30:35]
will give me the code so simply we will

[04:30:30 - 04:30:37]
copy paste all the codes of python HTML

[04:30:35 - 04:30:40]
CSS and Java from here on the same

[04:30:37 - 04:30:42]
document that we have created so copy

[04:30:40 - 04:30:45]
the python code I will go here and I

[04:30:42 - 04:30:48]
will paste it in my python file so

[04:30:45 - 04:30:53]
select all select we so I pasted it here

[04:30:48 - 04:30:57]
now next let me copy HTML code so copy

[04:30:53 - 04:31:02]
code go back to your riplet in your HTML

[04:30:57 - 04:31:04]
file let me paste the HTML code next it

[04:31:02 - 04:31:07]
is giving me the CSS code so copy the

[04:31:04 - 04:31:12]
code go back to your replate go to your

[04:31:07 - 04:31:15]
CSS file and paste your CSS code then go

[04:31:12 - 04:31:19]
back to your chat GPT and copy your

[04:31:15 - 04:31:22]
JavaScript code get back to our riplet

[04:31:19 - 04:31:25]
let me paste my JavaScript code so after

[04:31:22 - 04:31:29]
doing everything let me run my project

[04:31:25 - 04:31:29]
now right so let me

[04:31:31 - 04:31:38]
run so when you click on your run button

[04:31:34 - 04:31:41]
again you got your new output for two

[04:31:38 - 04:31:42]
different players so player one let me

[04:31:41 - 04:31:44]
choose Rock

[04:31:42 - 04:31:47]
and it is telling waiting for the other

[04:31:44 - 04:31:50]
player player to let me choose paper so

[04:31:47 - 04:31:53]
it'll tell paper is the winner right so

[04:31:50 - 04:31:55]
it'll tell player two is the winner like

[04:31:53 - 04:31:59]
this you can test for n number of

[04:31:55 - 04:32:02]
options you will get the output as who

[04:31:59 - 04:32:06]
is the winner in particular option or

[04:32:02 - 04:32:11]
game so this is how you can develop the

[04:32:06 - 04:32:13]
app using chat GPT as we reach the end

[04:32:11 - 04:32:16]
of this video I hope you now have a

[04:32:13 - 04:32:20]
clear understanding of how to develop a

[04:32:16 - 04:32:23]
simple game app using chat GPT prompts

[04:32:20 - 04:32:26]
and python the key takeaway is to break

[04:32:23 - 04:32:28]
down the task into manageable steps and

[04:32:26 - 04:32:31]
Leverage The Power of chat GPT to guide

[04:32:28 - 04:32:35]
you through each stage we'll be using

[04:32:31 - 04:32:36]
HTML CSS and JavaScript as our basic

[04:32:35 - 04:32:39]
programming languages the coding

[04:32:36 - 04:32:43]
playground of choice will be an online

[04:32:39 - 04:32:45]
editor one compiler which chates gp40 by

[04:32:43 - 04:32:49]
our site creating our Dream website is

[04:32:45 - 04:32:51]
as simple as describing what we envision

[04:32:49 - 04:32:54]
whether it's a portfolio a blog or an

[04:32:51 - 04:32:58]
interactive application GPT 40 will

[04:32:54 - 04:33:00]
guide us through the process ensuring we

[04:32:58 - 04:33:04]
achieve our goals efficiently and

[04:33:00 - 04:33:06]
creatively let's roll first let's open

[04:33:04 - 04:33:10]
our Char GPT playground and let me

[04:33:06 - 04:33:13]
select 4 o now let's see what will be

[04:33:10 - 04:33:17]
our prompts I want to build a portfolio

[04:33:13 - 04:33:20]
website let our front end be HTML CSS

[04:33:17 - 04:33:23]
and JavaScript I want to execute this on

[04:33:20 - 04:33:26]
an online editor namely one compiler

[04:33:23 - 04:33:27]
this goes our instruction constraint to

[04:33:26 - 04:33:30]
the

[04:33:27 - 04:33:32]
GPT I want this for the target audience

[04:33:30 - 04:33:34]
who have zero coding knowledge or at

[04:33:32 - 04:33:37]
their learning phase like college

[04:33:34 - 04:33:40]
students and early professionals so let

[04:33:37 - 04:33:42]
it be simple and easy to execute and

[04:33:40 - 04:33:46]
understand by them this sets target

[04:33:42 - 04:33:48]
audience to the GPT let the creation of

[04:33:46 - 04:33:50]
this be very responsive creative and

[04:33:48 - 04:33:52]
with simple explanation and stepbystep

process which helps them to understand

[04:33:52 - 04:33:57]
and create these easily this sets

[04:33:55 - 04:34:00]
context to our chat

[04:33:57 - 04:34:03]
GPT please explain everything from

[04:34:00 - 04:34:06]
scratch we are instructing chat GPT how

[04:34:03 - 04:34:08]
it has to give us the steps great now

[04:34:06 - 04:34:11]
that we understand our prompt let's

[04:34:26 - 04:34:33]
this to see our results how our website

[04:34:30 - 04:34:36]
looks like we just copy pasted three

[04:34:33 - 04:34:39]
different codes executing this codes is

[04:34:36 - 04:34:41]
very easy on the online one compiler

[04:34:39 - 04:34:44]
platform we just have to copy paste the

[04:34:41 - 04:34:47]
relevant codes in the sections first

[04:34:44 - 04:34:50]
goes HTML then comes CSS that is style

[04:34:47 - 04:34:52]
as a third part we just copy paste the

[04:34:50 - 04:34:54]
JavaScript code to the JavaScript

[04:34:52 - 04:34:56]
container you can see towards your

[04:34:54 - 04:34:59]
extreme right you have a preview window

[04:34:56 - 04:35:01]
once you click on the Run button it will

[04:34:59 - 04:35:03]
execute the complete code which you have

[04:36:26 - 04:36:32]
next level hello to all I'm Niha we're

[04:36:29 - 04:36:35]
going to explain you today a new topic

[04:36:32 - 04:36:38]
using Chad GPT now what is it let me

[04:36:35 - 04:36:40]
give you a hint unlocking the essence

[04:36:38 - 04:36:43]
one sentence at a time is the Art of Tex

[04:36:40 - 04:36:45]
summarization yes you are correct we're

[04:36:43 - 04:36:48]
going to understand text summarization

[04:36:45 - 04:36:50]
using chat JP so let's get it started

[04:36:48 - 04:36:53]
what we're going to cover today our

[04:36:50 - 04:36:56]
agenda is first we're going to discuss

[04:36:53 - 04:36:58]
introduction to text summarization and

[04:36:56 - 04:37:01]
then we're going to understand text

[04:36:58 - 04:37:03]
summarization using chat GPT so

[04:37:01 - 04:37:05]
introduction to text summarization so

[04:37:03 - 04:37:08]
text summarization in natural language

[04:37:05 - 04:37:10]
processing is the process of creating a

[04:37:08 - 04:37:14]
shortened version of given text while

[04:37:10 - 04:37:17]
detaining it most important information

[04:37:14 - 04:37:20]
it involves automatically extracting or

[04:37:17 - 04:37:23]
generating a concise summary that

[04:37:20 - 04:37:26]
captures the key ideas and main points

[04:37:23 - 04:37:29]
of the original text the goal of text

[04:37:26 - 04:37:32]
summarization in NLP is to help users

[04:37:29 - 04:37:36]
quickly grasp the essence of a document

[04:37:32 - 04:37:39]
without highlighting to read the entire

[04:37:36 - 04:37:42]
text thereby saving time and effort as

[04:37:39 - 04:37:44]
well it plays a crucial role in

[04:37:42 - 04:37:47]
information retrieval decision making

[04:37:44 - 04:37:48]
and efficient consumption of textual

[04:37:47 - 04:37:51]
data so this is all about Tex

[04:37:48 - 04:37:54]
summarization a brief about text

[04:37:51 - 04:37:56]
summarization now we're going to

[04:37:54 - 04:37:59]
understand more about this using chat

[04:37:56 - 04:38:02]
GPT so after the introduction to text

[04:37:59 - 04:38:05]
summarization let's understand the

[04:38:02 - 04:38:07]
concept using chat GPT so now we're

[04:38:05 - 04:38:12]
going to understand the steps the basic

[04:38:07 - 04:38:14]
steps of text summarization using python

[04:38:12 - 04:38:17]
on a given text but before that we'll

[04:38:14 - 04:38:19]
understand what are those steps are so

[04:38:17 - 04:38:22]
as you can see that over here I have

[04:38:19 - 04:38:24]
given a prompt that is steps to perform

[04:38:22 - 04:38:27]
text summarization on a given text using

[04:38:24 - 04:38:30]
python so you can see that first step

[04:38:27 - 04:38:32]
over here is what before you can see one

[04:38:30 - 04:38:34]
explanation is also there that Tex

[04:38:32 - 04:38:37]
summarization is a challenging task that

[04:38:34 - 04:38:40]
involve considering the main points of a

[04:38:37 - 04:38:42]
given text into a shorter version there

[04:38:40 - 04:38:45]
are different approaches

[04:38:42 - 04:38:48]
to text summarization basically so there

[04:38:45 - 04:38:51]
are multiple libraries which we can use

[04:38:48 - 04:38:54]
for summarizing the text but as you can

[04:38:51 - 04:38:57]
see here we have some limited libraries

[04:38:54 - 04:39:01]
using that we're going to summarize our

[04:38:57 - 04:39:05]
text based on a given text first step is

[04:39:01 - 04:39:08]
install required libraries as I said you

[04:39:05 - 04:39:11]
ensure that you have all the necessary

[04:39:08 - 04:39:13]
libraries for summarizing the text next

[04:39:11 - 04:39:17]
is two popular libraries for text

[04:39:13 - 04:39:20]
summarization are nltk and genes so here

[04:39:17 - 04:39:22]
you can see first we'll have to install

[04:39:20 - 04:39:25]
the nltk then after we're going to

[04:39:22 - 04:39:29]
import more libraries which is required

[04:39:25 - 04:39:32]
for pre-processing the text so first is

[04:39:29 - 04:39:36]
stop word which is the part of nl.

[04:39:32 - 04:39:41]
Corpus then nl. tokenize which is used

[04:39:36 - 04:39:44]
to tokenize the sentence into tokens and

[04:39:41 - 04:39:46]
there we going to import word tokenize

[04:39:44 - 04:39:49]
and send tokenize word basically we're

[04:39:46 - 04:39:51]
going to tokenize the word send means

[04:39:49 - 04:39:55]
when we tokenize the

[04:39:51 - 04:39:58]
sentences next is obviously the last DIY

[04:39:55 - 04:40:02]
which is used for summarizing the whole

[04:39:58 - 04:40:04]
text so now third step will come to uh

[04:40:02 - 04:40:07]
pre-process the text suppose if you want

[04:40:04 - 04:40:09]
to perform any necessary PR processing

[04:40:07 - 04:40:11]
steps so what you going to do you going

[04:40:09 - 04:40:16]
to remove the unnecessary

[04:40:11 - 04:40:19]
characters and converting the whole text

[04:40:16 - 04:40:21]
into lower case we're going to remove

[04:40:19 - 04:40:25]
the stop words you are going to tokenize

[04:40:21 - 04:40:27]
the sentences into sentences or words as

[04:40:25 - 04:40:30]
I can uh say over here by using this

[04:40:27 - 04:40:32]
library that you can do that so here you

[04:40:30 - 04:40:35]
can see that tokenize import word

[04:40:32 - 04:40:39]
tokenize s tokenize basically is used to

[04:40:35 - 04:40:43]
convert or will use to tokenize the text

[04:40:39 - 04:40:46]
into sentences or words now the next is

[04:40:43 - 04:40:49]
here is an example of pre-processing

[04:40:46 - 04:40:52]
using nltk so what we are doing we are

[04:40:49 - 04:40:54]
converting the text into lowercase we

[04:40:52 - 04:40:57]
are removing all the unnecessary

[04:40:54 - 04:41:00]
characters which we have in the text and

[04:40:57 - 04:41:02]
then after we're going to tokenize into

[04:41:00 - 04:41:05]
sentences then after we're going to

[04:41:02 - 04:41:07]
return return the tokenized sentence

[04:41:05 - 04:41:09]
after that we're going to remove stop

[04:41:07 - 04:41:12]
words this is the next step to

[04:41:09 - 04:41:14]
pre-process the text so in this what

[04:41:12 - 04:41:17]
we're going to do stop words are the

[04:41:14 - 04:41:21]
common words that do not carry much

[04:41:17 - 04:41:24]
meaning and can be removed to improve

[04:41:21 - 04:41:27]
the summarization process so here nltk

[04:41:24 - 04:41:30]
provide a list of stop words that you

[04:41:27 - 04:41:33]
can use here is an example how to remove

[04:41:30 - 04:41:37]
stop wordss and this is the complete

[04:41:33 - 04:41:40]
code for removing the stop wordss now

[04:41:37 - 04:41:42]
this code we going to apply on the text

[04:41:40 - 04:41:46]
basically from where we want to remove

[04:41:42 - 04:41:48]
all The Unwanted uh words and all the

[04:41:46 - 04:41:51]
unnecessary Words which generally the

[04:41:48 - 04:41:53]
part of a stop word and which is not

[04:41:51 - 04:41:55]
required during the summarization

[04:41:53 - 04:41:58]
process after that we're going to

[04:41:55 - 04:42:00]
generate the summary so basically what

[04:41:58 - 04:42:02]
we are doing here we are pre-processing

[04:42:00 - 04:42:04]
the text we are pre-processing the text

[04:42:02 - 04:42:08]
means we are removing all the unwanted

[04:42:04 - 04:42:11]
text basically from the text and at last

[04:42:08 - 04:42:13]
we'll apply the final code to get the

[04:42:11 - 04:42:15]
summary so here you can use a

[04:42:13 - 04:42:18]
summarization method to generate the

[04:42:15 - 04:42:21]
summary and here the summarize function

[04:42:18 - 04:42:24]
from genim provide a simple way to

[04:42:21 - 04:42:26]
perform extractive summarization here

[04:42:24 - 04:42:29]
and here is an example for that you can

[04:42:26 - 04:42:32]
see using this code what we are doing

[04:42:29 - 04:42:34]
that we have separate sentences and at

[04:42:32 - 04:42:36]
the summarization part we're going to

[04:42:34 - 04:42:39]
join that single text into a form of

[04:42:36 - 04:42:44]
sentence and that complete part we going

[04:42:39 - 04:42:46]
to uh convert into a summary so the last

[04:42:44 - 04:42:49]
is generating the summary so for that

[04:42:46 - 04:42:51]
we're going to use this code summary is

[04:42:49 - 04:42:53]
basically what you can use summarization

[04:42:51 - 04:42:55]
method for that to generate the summary

[04:42:53 - 04:42:58]
the final part the summarized function

[04:42:55 - 04:43:02]
we're going to use in that and that

[04:42:58 - 04:43:05]
summarized function basically use uh to

[04:43:02 - 04:43:09]
summarize to get the important text out

[04:43:05 - 04:43:12]
of the uh whole text what what we are

[04:43:09 - 04:43:14]
using in this for text Su ization so

[04:43:12 - 04:43:19]
this is all the combined code what we

[04:43:14 - 04:43:22]
have already discussed here now this is

[04:43:19 - 04:43:23]
the basic example of teex summarization

[04:43:22 - 04:43:26]
using extractive

[04:43:23 - 04:43:29]
method you can enhance the summarization

[04:43:26 - 04:43:32]
by using other techniques like tfidf

[04:43:29 - 04:43:34]
word embedding or neural network models

[04:43:32 - 04:43:37]
so as I said earlier there are a lot of

[04:43:34 - 04:43:39]
multiple ways to do the tech

[04:43:37 - 04:43:41]
summarization so today we are just

[04:43:39 - 04:43:43]
covering one of the techniqu

[04:43:41 - 04:43:46]
and how to perform the text

[04:43:43 - 04:43:50]
summarization by using this chat GPT and

[04:43:46 - 04:43:52]
how it is so easy to use or to

[04:43:50 - 04:43:54]
understand the text summarization by

[04:43:52 - 04:43:58]
using chat GPT so let's understand that

[04:43:54 - 04:44:00]
part now we're going to apply the text

[04:43:58 - 04:44:02]
summarization technique we're going to

[04:44:00 - 04:44:04]
apply all the code what we have

[04:44:02 - 04:44:08]
discussed here on a g on a particular

[04:44:04 - 04:44:10]
text so let's start that and understand

[04:44:08 - 04:44:13]
how to perform text summarization till

[04:44:10 - 04:44:16]
now we we have discussed about all the

[04:44:13 - 04:44:18]
steps which is required for text

[04:44:16 - 04:44:21]
summarization now we're going to

[04:44:18 - 04:44:24]
implement those steps on some text to

[04:44:21 - 04:44:28]
get the summarized form so here you can

[04:44:24 - 04:44:30]
see I have given a prompt that python

[04:44:28 - 04:44:32]
code to perform text summarization on

[04:44:30 - 04:44:36]
the given text so you can see that the

[04:44:32 - 04:44:39]
text is actually too long and we're

[04:44:36 - 04:44:41]
going to understand how to perform text

[04:44:39 - 04:44:44]
summarization on this given text is step

[04:44:41 - 04:44:47]
by step so let's understand that so when

[04:44:44 - 04:44:50]
I run this prompt what I am getting as

[04:44:47 - 04:44:54]
an output over here so here you can see

[04:44:50 - 04:44:58]
that we have a code based on the prompt

[04:44:54 - 04:45:00]
what we shared in chat GPT and as you

[04:44:58 - 04:45:04]
can see that first is we are importing

[04:45:00 - 04:45:07]
all the required libraries then after we

[04:45:04 - 04:45:11]
are using the text on which we're going

[04:45:07 - 04:45:13]
to process all the pre-processing task

[04:45:11 - 04:45:16]
then after what we are doing we are

[04:45:13 - 04:45:19]
tokenizing the text into sentence we are

[04:45:16 - 04:45:23]
token tokenizing the sentence into word

[04:45:19 - 04:45:25]
by using this analytik do word tokenized

[04:45:23 - 04:45:28]
function we are converting that whole

[04:45:25 - 04:45:31]
text into lower case by using lower

[04:45:28 - 04:45:34]
function then after as this is the part

[04:45:31 - 04:45:37]
of pre-processing we have to remove all

[04:45:34 - 04:45:40]
the unnecessary characters and uh you

[04:45:37 - 04:45:43]
can see that we are removing over here

[04:45:40 - 04:45:46]
all this stop words so common word with

[04:45:43 - 04:45:48]
little meaning if you really want to

[04:45:46 - 04:45:51]
understand more about stop word you can

[04:45:48 - 04:45:56]
just ask over here as a prompt that what

[04:45:51 - 04:45:59]
is basically stop words are so chat D

[04:45:56 - 04:46:02]
will give you a complete explanation of

[04:45:59 - 04:46:05]
stop word as well but in brief I can say

[04:46:02 - 04:46:08]
that that those words which have little

[04:46:05 - 04:46:08]
meaning and which is not so required in

[04:46:08 - 04:46:12]
the

[04:46:08 - 04:46:15]
text so we are removing all those text

[04:46:12 - 04:46:17]
and which we call stop word by using

[04:46:15 - 04:46:20]
this code then after we can see that

[04:46:17 - 04:46:23]
filtered words and we have applied over

[04:46:20 - 04:46:25]
here that complete code for that then

[04:46:23 - 04:46:28]
after what we are doing here calculating

[04:46:25 - 04:46:30]
the frequency of each word So based on

[04:46:28 - 04:46:33]
the frequence frequency only we're going

[04:46:30 - 04:46:35]
to decide that which word should be

[04:46:33 - 04:46:37]
there in the

[04:46:35 - 04:46:40]
summary then after the next step is rank

[04:46:37 - 04:46:41]
the sentences based on the sum of word

[04:46:40 - 04:46:44]
frequency

[04:46:41 - 04:46:46]
and this is the complete code for that

[04:46:44 - 04:46:48]
summary length that how many number of

[04:46:46 - 04:46:52]
sentences you want in your desired

[04:46:48 - 04:46:55]
summary so this is a complete code which

[04:46:52 - 04:46:59]
we are getting as an output through chat

[04:46:55 - 04:47:02]
gbt now you can see that here this is

[04:46:59 - 04:47:04]
the complete explanation also we have

[04:47:02 - 04:47:06]
first is as I said importing the

[04:47:04 - 04:47:09]
necessary libraries then after

[04:47:06 - 04:47:13]
downloading the required nltk resources

[04:47:09 - 04:47:16]
using nltk down function assign the text

[04:47:13 - 04:47:20]
to be summarized to text variable then

[04:47:16 - 04:47:22]
after tokenize the text into sentences

[04:47:20 - 04:47:26]
and uh how we're going to use that sent

[04:47:22 - 04:47:29]
underscore tokenize function after that

[04:47:26 - 04:47:31]
tokenize the sentence into words so

[04:47:29 - 04:47:33]
whole sentence first will get tokenized

[04:47:31 - 04:47:36]
into sentence then whole sentences will

[04:47:33 - 04:47:39]
get tokenized into word by using word

[04:47:36 - 04:47:42]
uncore tokenized function and then after

[04:47:39 - 04:47:45]
we convert them into

[04:47:42 - 04:47:48]
lowercase next step is removing a stop

[04:47:45 - 04:47:50]
word from the word using a list

[04:47:48 - 04:47:53]
comprehension we're going to talk about

[04:47:50 - 04:47:57]
his stop words more but first we're

[04:47:53 - 04:47:59]
going to implement this code into collab

[04:47:57 - 04:48:02]
notebook that whether we are getting a

[04:47:59 - 04:48:05]
correct output using this code or not

[04:48:02 - 04:48:08]
next you can see over here that after

[04:48:05 - 04:48:11]
removing stop words we are calculating

[04:48:08 - 04:48:15]
the frequency of each word using

[04:48:11 - 04:48:19]
frequency disc function that

[04:48:15 - 04:48:21]
fqd dis function rank the sentences

[04:48:19 - 04:48:24]
based on the sum of word frequency and

[04:48:21 - 04:48:26]
store the score in the sentence score

[04:48:24 - 04:48:29]
dictionary set the desired summary

[04:48:26 - 04:48:32]
length summary length is basically uh is

[04:48:29 - 04:48:35]
what the number of sentence you want in

[04:48:32 - 04:48:37]
the summary like three sentence as a

[04:48:35 - 04:48:39]
summary you want four sentences as a

[04:48:37 - 04:48:41]
summary you want So based on that we

[04:48:39 - 04:48:43]
will give the number number over there

[04:48:41 - 04:48:46]
and we'll get the

[04:48:43 - 04:48:48]
output then the third last step over

[04:48:46 - 04:48:52]
here is select the top rank sentences

[04:48:48 - 04:48:55]
using n largest from hip q and construct

[04:48:52 - 04:48:57]
the summary by joining the S selected

[04:48:55 - 04:49:00]
sentences with spaces and then after

[04:48:57 - 04:49:02]
we're going to print that whole summary

[04:49:00 - 04:49:04]
so basically what we are doing here

[04:49:02 - 04:49:07]
first we are importing the required

[04:49:04 - 04:49:11]
libraries then we will going to apply

[04:49:07 - 04:49:13]
the pre-processing uh on a given text

[04:49:11 - 04:49:17]
and then after we're going to summarize

[04:49:13 - 04:49:20]
the whole text by after removing the

[04:49:17 - 04:49:23]
stop words and unnecessary uh characters

[04:49:20 - 04:49:25]
and at last we'll get the summary by

[04:49:23 - 04:49:28]
using summary function summarized

[04:49:25 - 04:49:30]
function so let's understand that what

[04:49:28 - 04:49:35]
code we are getting over here so now

[04:49:30 - 04:49:38]
let's implement the code what we have uh

[04:49:35 - 04:49:42]
seen over here in chat GPT in collab

[04:49:38 - 04:49:44]
notebook and when we Implement that we

[04:49:42 - 04:49:46]
want to actually see that that the

[04:49:44 - 04:49:49]
output what we are getting is correct or

[04:49:46 - 04:49:53]
not so as you can see I have copied the

[04:49:49 - 04:49:56]
whole code over here and when I will run

[04:49:53 - 04:49:59]
this code let's run this code I'm

[04:49:56 - 04:50:01]
getting over here summary and how many

[04:49:59 - 04:50:04]
sentences I'm getting over here is three

[04:50:01 - 04:50:06]
sentences why the reason is I have given

[04:50:04 - 04:50:10]
the summary length over here three let's

[04:50:06 - 04:50:11]
say if I give four over here and when I

[04:50:10 - 04:50:14]
will run this

[04:50:11 - 04:50:15]
code I will get I will get the four

[04:50:14 - 04:50:19]
sentences and that four sentences will

[04:50:15 - 04:50:22]
get joined and give you a proper summary

[04:50:19 - 04:50:24]
based on Force so we have understood uh

[04:50:22 - 04:50:27]
the text

[04:50:24 - 04:50:29]
summarization each and every code of it

[04:50:27 - 04:50:32]
and we have implemented as well that in

[04:50:29 - 04:50:33]
the collab notebook just to get the

[04:50:32 - 04:50:36]
confirmation whether we are getting the

[04:50:33 - 04:50:39]
output or not so we're going to

[04:50:36 - 04:50:41]
understand the combined explanation what

[04:50:39 - 04:50:43]
I discussed with you

[04:50:41 - 04:50:45]
into a step so in step by step we'll

[04:50:43 - 04:50:47]
understand each and everything so we'll

[04:50:45 - 04:50:51]
give you better Clarity that what we

[04:50:47 - 04:50:53]
have done uh in text summarization so I

[04:50:51 - 04:50:56]
have given the prompt over here for that

[04:50:53 - 04:50:58]
that write the above code step by step

[04:50:56 - 04:51:01]
with explanation when you give this

[04:50:58 - 04:51:04]
prompt you will get all the code and in

[04:51:01 - 04:51:07]
a separate way like in step by step you

[04:51:04 - 04:51:09]
will get each and every code and parall

[04:51:07 - 04:51:11]
you will get the explanation of each

[04:51:09 - 04:51:14]
step so first first is import the

[04:51:11 - 04:51:16]
required Library so all the libraries we

[04:51:14 - 04:51:18]
have to give there because once we

[04:51:16 - 04:51:20]
implement the library then only you will

[04:51:18 - 04:51:23]
be able to pre-process the text you'll

[04:51:20 - 04:51:25]
be able to summarize the text by using

[04:51:23 - 04:51:28]
these libraries so first is analytic

[04:51:25 - 04:51:31]
Library which is used for what natural

[04:51:28 - 04:51:35]
language processing task processing task

[04:51:31 - 04:51:39]
means like tokenization stop removal Etc

[04:51:35 - 04:51:43]
second is stop from nltk dopus so in

[04:51:39 - 04:51:45]
nltk do Corp Pur was it provide a common

[04:51:43 - 04:51:48]
words to be removed from the text so now

[04:51:45 - 04:51:50]
we'll understand what are stop words

[04:51:48 - 04:51:52]
because here you can see that stop words

[04:51:50 - 04:51:55]
basically uh over here provide a list of

[04:51:52 - 04:51:57]
common words what are those common words

[04:51:55 - 04:52:04]
are so when I

[04:51:57 - 04:52:04]
ask Chad gbt that what are stop words

[04:52:13 - 04:52:20]
so you can see as an output over here

[04:52:16 - 04:52:23]
is in the above code stop word refer to

[04:52:20 - 04:52:26]
a set of commonly used word in language

[04:52:23 - 04:52:28]
that often carry little or no meaningful

[04:52:26 - 04:52:32]
information when it comes to natural

[04:52:28 - 04:52:35]
language processing task like text

[04:52:32 - 04:52:39]
summarization what we are doing these

[04:52:35 - 04:52:42]
words are like the is between and two

[04:52:39 - 04:52:46]
kind of English words which has no

[04:52:42 - 04:52:48]
meaning in terms of if you want somebody

[04:52:46 - 04:52:49]
of a particular text because generally

[04:52:48 - 04:52:51]
in text summarization the meaning of

[04:52:49 - 04:52:53]
text summarization in itself is to

[04:52:51 - 04:52:55]
summarize the whole text and to get the

[04:52:53 - 04:52:59]
meaningful information out of the

[04:52:55 - 04:53:02]
complete text so in the code stop word

[04:52:59 - 04:53:06]
module which is the uh part of

[04:53:02 - 04:53:08]
analytical Library basically a set of

[04:53:06 - 04:53:11]
stopword specific to the English

[04:53:08 - 04:53:14]
language and stop word. word English

[04:53:11 - 04:53:17]
over here you can see that a function it

[04:53:14 - 04:53:19]
return a set of English stop word which

[04:53:17 - 04:53:22]
is actually which has no meaning or

[04:53:19 - 04:53:25]
which has no importance in terms of

[04:53:22 - 04:53:27]
summarization by removing this stop word

[04:53:25 - 04:53:29]
from the text you can see that before

[04:53:27 - 04:53:32]
text summarization we have to remove it

[04:53:29 - 04:53:33]
and we can focus on the most important

[04:53:32 - 04:53:36]
part of the

[04:53:33 - 04:53:38]
text now the next is the line of code

[04:53:36 - 04:53:41]
filter word over there which we going to

[04:53:38 - 04:53:45]
see the meaning of the fil filter word

[04:53:41 - 04:53:47]
is over here is to get the words which

[04:53:45 - 04:53:50]
will get filtered out through after

[04:53:47 - 04:53:54]
removing the stop wordss so when I will

[04:53:50 - 04:53:58]
go back to the code as you can see

[04:53:54 - 04:54:01]
here that chat GPT is giving you the

[04:53:58 - 04:54:03]
explanation of stop word after that here

[04:54:01 - 04:54:07]
you can see that next one is freak disc

[04:54:03 - 04:54:10]
we'll come to that uh fre filtered word

[04:54:07 - 04:54:12]
but before that let me explain you the

[04:54:10 - 04:54:14]
next next module which we're going to

[04:54:12 - 04:54:16]
use over here is frig disc which is

[04:54:14 - 04:54:19]
frequency distribution we already

[04:54:16 - 04:54:22]
discussed that but we're going to

[04:54:19 - 04:54:24]
understand this in more detailed way so

[04:54:22 - 04:54:28]
why it is used it is used to calculate

[04:54:24 - 04:54:31]
the frequency distribution of words next

[04:54:28 - 04:54:34]
is we are going we are going to use hip

[04:54:31 - 04:54:38]
Q which is basically what used to select

[04:54:34 - 04:54:41]
the top ranked sentences based on their

[04:54:38 - 04:54:44]
scores so we have already imported all

[04:54:41 - 04:54:46]
the libraries Next Step was what now the

[04:54:44 - 04:54:47]
next step is we're going to define the

[04:54:46 - 04:54:49]
text which will going to be summarized

[04:54:47 - 04:54:51]
so we have already discussed about the

[04:54:49 - 04:54:55]
text as well the text variable is store

[04:54:51 - 04:54:57]
the input text that we want to summarize

[04:54:55 - 04:55:00]
fourth step is tokenize the text into

[04:54:57 - 04:55:03]
sentences and uh which will obviously

[04:55:00 - 04:55:06]
convert which will tokenize all the text

[04:55:03 - 04:55:09]
into sentence and it will break the text

[04:55:06 - 04:55:11]
into individual sentences because we had

[04:55:09 - 04:55:14]
actually in the starting the combined

[04:55:11 - 04:55:18]
paragraph we're going to tokenize that

[04:55:14 - 04:55:20]
paragraph into um separate sentences and

[04:55:18 - 04:55:23]
then we're going to store them in the

[04:55:20 - 04:55:25]
sentences list after that once we'll get

[04:55:23 - 04:55:28]
all the sentence separately we're going

[04:55:25 - 04:55:31]
to break those sentences into word how

[04:55:28 - 04:55:34]
we're going to do that by using word

[04:55:31 - 04:55:35]
underscore tokenized function so here we

[04:55:34 - 04:55:38]
are applying that only we're going to

[04:55:35 - 04:55:41]
implement that word underscore tokenized

[04:55:38 - 04:55:44]
function on uh uh on the previous code

[04:55:41 - 04:55:47]
basically on the sentences and we'll

[04:55:44 - 04:55:50]
tokenize that sentence into

[04:55:47 - 04:55:53]
word after doing that you can see parall

[04:55:50 - 04:55:54]
we are converting those word into lower

[04:55:53 - 04:55:56]
case by using lower function so lower

[04:55:54 - 04:55:59]
function is basically used to convert

[04:55:56 - 04:56:02]
all the capital words with capital

[04:55:59 - 04:56:05]
initial everything into lower case now

[04:56:02 - 04:56:07]
the resulting word where will get stored

[04:56:05 - 04:56:09]
in word list as we were storing the

[04:56:07 - 04:56:12]
sentences in the sentences list here we

[04:56:09 - 04:56:16]
are storing the word tokenized word into

[04:56:12 - 04:56:18]
word list after that now once we'll get

[04:56:16 - 04:56:21]
all the tokenized word what we going to

[04:56:18 - 04:56:23]
do the next step would be removing stop

[04:56:21 - 04:56:26]
word we have already discussed what our

[04:56:23 - 04:56:28]
stop word is and next step in that same

[04:56:26 - 04:56:31]
code we are seeing over here is filtered

[04:56:28 - 04:56:33]
word so filtered word we were discussing

[04:56:31 - 04:56:36]
that I told you we're going to discuss

[04:56:33 - 04:56:38]
more about it so here filtered word are

[04:56:36 - 04:56:40]
what after removing after getting the

[04:56:38 - 04:56:43]
stop word we'll get the complete set of

[04:56:40 - 04:56:45]
stop word and then we will going to

[04:56:43 - 04:56:48]
remove that and once we'll remove all

[04:56:45 - 04:56:51]
the stop word from the text from the uh

[04:56:48 - 04:56:54]
the list of word what we have at the end

[04:56:51 - 04:56:56]
the remaining word which which will get

[04:56:54 - 04:56:58]
as an output we'll term as over here we

[04:56:56 - 04:57:01]
are giving the name for those words as a

[04:56:58 - 04:57:03]
filtered words so next step would be

[04:57:01 - 04:57:05]
calculating the frequency of each word

[04:57:03 - 04:57:08]
I've already discussed this but I'm

[04:57:05 - 04:57:10]
explaining now step by step just to get

[04:57:08 - 04:57:12]
the more clarity on it so next step

[04:57:10 - 04:57:15]
calculate the frequency of each word by

[04:57:12 - 04:57:19]
using uh I discussed and I told you

[04:57:15 - 04:57:21]
earlier that freak disc is a function

[04:57:19 - 04:57:25]
which is used to get the frequency of

[04:57:21 - 04:57:27]
each word based on that we're going to

[04:57:25 - 04:57:30]
understand we're going to decide like

[04:57:27 - 04:57:32]
which word we're going to use as a

[04:57:30 - 04:57:35]
summary we're going to include in a

[04:57:32 - 04:57:37]
summary now the rank the sentence based

[04:57:35 - 04:57:40]
on word frequencies higher the frequency

[04:57:37 - 04:57:43]
we'll get the higher chance to the part

[04:57:40 - 04:57:45]
of the summary so here test score

[04:57:43 - 04:57:49]
dictionary is initialized to store the

[04:57:45 - 04:57:51]
score of each sentence we are creating a

[04:57:49 - 04:57:52]
dictionary over here the curly bracket

[04:57:51 - 04:57:56]
basically over here curly BR is

[04:57:52 - 04:57:58]
basically what it is actually the

[04:57:56 - 04:58:01]
dictionary only and here we will going

[04:57:58 - 04:58:03]
to append all the score of each sentence

[04:58:01 - 04:58:06]
now for each sentence in the sentences

[04:58:03 - 04:58:09]
list the words are tokenized and convert

[04:58:06 - 04:58:12]
into lower case so we are doing the same

[04:58:09 - 04:58:16]
here and then after if a word is present

[04:58:12 - 04:58:18]
in word frequency so if it is present in

[04:58:16 - 04:58:20]
the dictionary then its frequency is

[04:58:18 - 04:58:23]
added to the score of the corresponding

[04:58:20 - 04:58:25]
sentence in senten score then after we

[04:58:23 - 04:58:27]
will going to set the desired summary

[04:58:25 - 04:58:29]
length how many sentences you want in a

[04:58:27 - 04:58:31]
summary so summary length is equal to

[04:58:29 - 04:58:33]
three we are giving it's up to you as I

[04:58:31 - 04:58:36]
said earlier as well and at last we will

[04:58:33 - 04:58:39]
get the final summary based on the

[04:58:36 - 04:58:42]
length what we are deciding over here so

[04:58:39 - 04:58:45]
now uh here you can see that we are

[04:58:42 - 04:58:48]
going to implement those code step by

[04:58:45 - 04:58:51]
step earlier we have seen the output we

[04:58:48 - 04:58:53]
were getting the output but uh we have

[04:58:51 - 04:58:55]
applied the whole code at once now we're

[04:58:53 - 04:58:57]
going to apply step by step so you will

[04:58:55 - 04:58:59]
get like at the end of each step what

[04:58:57 - 04:59:01]
output you are getting so we have

[04:58:59 - 04:59:05]
applied all the we have implemented all

[04:59:01 - 04:59:07]
the libraries we have uh given the text

[04:59:05 - 04:59:10]
which will going to

[04:59:07 - 04:59:13]
summarize and when you see that that we

[04:59:10 - 04:59:16]
are converting this complete this

[04:59:13 - 04:59:21]
complete text into sentences when I run

[04:59:16 - 04:59:23]
this code I'm getting all the sentences

[04:59:21 - 04:59:25]
like the complete paragraph into the

[04:59:23 - 04:59:28]
form of sentences then after the next

[04:59:25 - 04:59:33]
step would be to break the sentences

[04:59:28 - 04:59:35]
into words so when I will run this code

[04:59:33 - 04:59:38]
this code will break those sentences

[04:59:35 - 04:59:40]
into word so we are getting all the

[04:59:38 - 04:59:42]
sentences now in the form of words

[04:59:40 - 04:59:46]
basically we are tokenizing the sentence

[04:59:42 - 04:59:49]
into words once we get all the words

[04:59:46 - 04:59:52]
tokenized word we're going to apply the

[04:59:49 - 04:59:56]
stop word function which is used to

[04:59:52 - 04:59:58]
remove the stop word from this given uh

[04:59:56 - 05:00:00]
tokenized word and at the end we will

[04:59:58 - 05:00:03]
get the filtered words so when I will

[05:00:00 - 05:00:06]
run this code you can see that here we

[05:00:03 - 05:00:10]
are getting only the usable word

[05:00:06 - 05:00:13]
meaningful words except those the is

[05:00:10 - 05:00:15]
between of kind of stop words that has

[05:00:13 - 05:00:18]
been removed from here we only have the

[05:00:15 - 05:00:19]
filtered word with us we only have the

[05:00:18 - 05:00:22]
meaningful word with us which is

[05:00:19 - 05:00:24]
actually required for our summary next

[05:00:22 - 05:00:27]
is we're going to calculate now the

[05:00:24 - 05:00:31]
frequency so when I will run this

[05:00:27 - 05:00:34]
code I will get the sentence score so

[05:00:31 - 05:00:35]
here you can see that the first sentence

[05:00:34 - 05:00:38]
is this

[05:00:35 - 05:00:42]
one so when you will see what is the

[05:00:38 - 05:00:45]
score of this sentence is 1 18 118 when

[05:00:42 - 05:00:48]
I will check the other one the other one

[05:00:45 - 05:00:50]
has 87 same the next sentence has the

[05:00:48 - 05:00:53]
frequency

[05:00:50 - 05:00:57]
73 the other fourth fourth one has which

[05:00:53 - 05:00:59]
how much 70 so here we are getting the

[05:00:57 - 05:01:01]
score of the sentence we are getting the

[05:00:59 - 05:01:04]
frequency of the sentence now we have

[05:01:01 - 05:01:08]
the frequency based on these ranks we'll

[05:01:04 - 05:01:09]
get the final summary and how we'll get

[05:01:08 - 05:01:10]
the final summary first we have to

[05:01:09 - 05:01:12]
decide

[05:01:10 - 05:01:14]
how many number of sentences you want in

[05:01:12 - 05:01:18]
your desired summary so here I have

[05:01:14 - 05:01:20]
given three and then after we'll going

[05:01:18 - 05:01:22]
to understand what we're going to select

[05:01:20 - 05:01:26]
the top ranked sentences based on the

[05:01:22 - 05:01:28]
frequency as I already shown you and

[05:01:26 - 05:01:31]
we're going to print those uh top ranked

[05:01:28 - 05:01:35]
sentences as a summary over here so when

[05:01:31 - 05:01:38]
I will run this code I'm getting the top

[05:01:35 - 05:01:40]
ranked sentences in the form of summary

[05:01:38 - 05:01:43]
and here joint function I'm using

[05:01:40 - 05:01:46]
because obviously three sentences if I'm

[05:01:43 - 05:01:48]
getting I don't want in the form of

[05:01:46 - 05:01:51]
sentences way I want that in the form of

[05:01:48 - 05:01:54]
paragraph so I'm going to join that

[05:01:51 - 05:01:55]
three sentences top rank sentences and

[05:01:54 - 05:01:57]
that will get joined and we'll show you

[05:01:55 - 05:02:00]
in the form of a summary in the form of

[05:01:57 - 05:02:02]
paragraph so here you can see the first

[05:02:00 - 05:02:04]
sentence then the second sentence is

[05:02:02 - 05:02:06]
this one and the third one is the

[05:02:04 - 05:02:09]
quarterly profit so these three senten

[05:02:06 - 05:02:11]
are the top rank sentences which I have

[05:02:09 - 05:02:14]
you which I have join using join

[05:02:11 - 05:02:17]
function so that's how you can do the

[05:02:14 - 05:02:19]
text summarization using chat GPT and

[05:02:17 - 05:02:22]
it's very easy to understand suppose if

[05:02:19 - 05:02:25]
you stuck somewhere in some code you can

[05:02:22 - 05:02:28]
simply just copy that code as a prompt

[05:02:25 - 05:02:31]
and ask chat GPT the complete detailed

[05:02:28 - 05:02:34]
explanation of that and you will get a

[05:02:31 - 05:02:37]
proper and exact explanation So based on

[05:02:34 - 05:02:40]
that while understanding the theory you

[05:02:37 - 05:02:42]
are implementing that theory in a

[05:02:40 - 05:02:46]
practical way as well so which is

[05:02:42 - 05:02:49]
actually time saving for you as well so

[05:02:46 - 05:02:52]
let's end this part and we'll discuss

[05:02:49 - 05:02:54]
the summary what we have learned till

[05:02:52 - 05:02:57]
now hello Learners today we're going to

[05:02:54 - 05:02:59]
understand about data analysis but not

[05:02:57 - 05:03:02]
through a normal usual process we're

[05:02:59 - 05:03:06]
going to understand like how to use chat

[05:03:02 - 05:03:08]
GPT to analyze a data so let's get it

[05:03:06 - 05:03:11]
started first our agenda would be

[05:03:08 - 05:03:15]
introduction to data analysis then

[05:03:11 - 05:03:17]
difference between CH GPT 3.5 and GPT 4

[05:03:15 - 05:03:20]
applying python codes to analyze a data

[05:03:17 - 05:03:22]
set and then applying Excel commands to

[05:03:20 - 05:03:25]
analyze a data set on which we're going

[05:03:22 - 05:03:27]
to analyze the whole data now we'll

[05:03:25 - 05:03:30]
start understanding the introduction to

[05:03:27 - 05:03:32]
data analysis what is data analysis is

[05:03:30 - 05:03:34]
so data analysis is a method of

[05:03:32 - 05:03:36]
inspecting cleaning transforming and

[05:03:34 - 05:03:40]
modeling data to discover useful

[05:03:36 - 05:03:42]
information conclusion and support DEC

[05:03:40 - 05:03:44]
making there are various steps that

[05:03:42 - 05:03:47]
comes under data analysis process such

[05:03:44 - 05:03:49]
as first is data collection second is

[05:03:47 - 05:03:51]
data cleaning and pre-processing third

[05:03:49 - 05:03:54]
one would be explor data analysis then

[05:03:51 - 05:03:56]
Thea transformation and then model

[05:03:54 - 05:03:59]
building after that evaluation and then

[05:03:56 - 05:04:01]
at last interpretation so next we're

[05:03:59 - 05:04:05]
going to understand difference between

[05:04:01 - 05:04:08]
GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 now why I'm discussing

[05:04:05 - 05:04:10]
about difference between both uh version

[05:04:08 - 05:04:12]
because we're going to to apply the data

[05:04:10 - 05:04:14]
analysis process we're going to

[05:04:12 - 05:04:17]
understand data analysis process using

[05:04:14 - 05:04:20]
GPT 4 which is the latest version of

[05:04:17 - 05:04:22]
chat GPT and before we start working on

[05:04:20 - 05:04:25]
that we should understand why we are not

[05:04:22 - 05:04:29]
working on 3.5 that is a older version

[05:04:25 - 05:04:34]
of chat GPT so there are few differences

[05:04:29 - 05:04:36]
between 3.5 chat GPT 3.5 and 4 first

[05:04:34 - 05:04:39]
difference is that chat GPT 4 is

[05:04:36 - 05:04:42]
multimodel and has more process

[05:04:39 - 05:04:44]
processing power compared to chat GPT

[05:04:42 - 05:04:48]
3.5 now what it

[05:04:44 - 05:04:51]
is so the major limitation of chat GPT

[05:04:48 - 05:04:55]
3.5 was that it was uni model now what

[05:04:51 - 05:04:58]
is uni model is in the sense of chb only

[05:04:55 - 05:05:02]
understand and interpret text input in

[05:04:58 - 05:05:05]
chat GPT 4 you'll be able to apply more

[05:05:02 - 05:05:07]
advanced features such as you can upload

[05:05:05 - 05:05:11]
the images you can upload the whole data

[05:05:07 - 05:05:13]
set and uh you can can basically upload

[05:05:11 - 05:05:17]
images there so not even text but you

[05:05:13 - 05:05:20]
can apply more advanced features using

[05:05:17 - 05:05:24]
chat GPT 4 so which we cannot do in

[05:05:20 - 05:05:27]
3.5 second one is Chad GPT is more

[05:05:24 - 05:05:31]
accurate than chat GPT 3.5 so in terms

[05:05:27 - 05:05:34]
of accuracy also that CH GPT 4 version

[05:05:31 - 05:05:37]
uh working more correctly than 3.5 j4

[05:05:34 - 05:05:39]
can solve various problems uh and

[05:05:37 - 05:05:43]
equations uh in subject as vared as

[05:05:39 - 05:05:46]
calculus geometry and algebra CH GPT 3.5

[05:05:43 - 05:05:50]
on the other hand can only give us the

[05:05:46 - 05:05:51]
direction like how to solve the problem

[05:05:50 - 05:05:54]
and rather than providing the actual

[05:05:51 - 05:05:57]
solution there so that's why we follow

[05:05:54 - 05:06:02]
nowadays J gp4 which work better than CH

[05:05:57 - 05:06:06]
GPT 3.5 so here you can see two options

[05:06:02 - 05:06:09]
GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 so basically GPT 3.5

[05:06:06 - 05:06:11]
here if you want to upload a data set

[05:06:09 - 05:06:13]
it's not possible because we do not have

[05:06:11 - 05:06:18]
the upload file

[05:06:13 - 05:06:21]
option you can ask J GPT if you have any

[05:06:18 - 05:06:24]
uh question if you want to analyze a

[05:06:21 - 05:06:27]
data you can ask it by using text only

[05:06:24 - 05:06:29]
but in gp4 you are getting an option to

[05:06:27 - 05:06:31]
upload file so here first we're going to

[05:06:29 - 05:06:34]
upload the data set on which we're going

[05:06:31 - 05:06:39]
to perform data and then based on that

[05:06:34 - 05:06:41]
we'll ask chat gp4 using some prompts so

[05:06:39 - 05:06:41]
let's get a

[05:06:42 - 05:06:49]
started so after uploading the data set

[05:06:46 - 05:06:50]
we're going to understand how to load

[05:06:49 - 05:06:53]
the data what is the process of data

[05:06:50 - 05:06:55]
analysis as we discussed earlier that

[05:06:53 - 05:06:58]
there are various steps that should

[05:06:55 - 05:07:00]
cover under data analysis we'll

[05:06:58 - 05:07:03]
understand those step step by step first

[05:07:00 - 05:07:06]
and then we'll move to the uh final

[05:07:03 - 05:07:09]
analysis of the data set basically that

[05:07:06 - 05:07:13]
is car mpg over here so for that first

[05:07:09 - 05:07:15]
will ask tgpt that what are the steps

[05:07:13 - 05:07:18]
that should be covered in data analysis

[05:07:15 - 05:07:21]
by using a prompt so when I

[05:07:18 - 05:07:25]
enter the prompt over here that is what

[05:07:21 - 05:07:29]
are the various steps to analyze the

[05:07:25 - 05:07:32]
data you can see that the chat gbt 4

[05:07:29 - 05:07:35]
will show you all the steps that should

[05:07:32 - 05:07:37]
be covered during the analysis process

[05:07:35 - 05:07:41]
so first is understanding the problem

[05:07:37 - 05:07:43]
statement then after data loading then

[05:07:41 - 05:07:45]
after explor data analysis that is data

[05:07:43 - 05:07:49]
exploration and understanding that has

[05:07:45 - 05:07:52]
subtopics as well which will discuss and

[05:07:49 - 05:07:54]
then after data cleaning feature

[05:07:52 - 05:07:57]
engineering and data

[05:07:54 - 05:07:58]
visualization so these all are the steps

[05:07:57 - 05:08:02]
that should come under data analysis

[05:07:58 - 05:08:04]
process let's understand the first step

[05:08:02 - 05:08:06]
understanding the problem statement so

[05:08:04 - 05:08:08]
understanding the problem statement is

[05:08:06 - 05:08:11]
what basically you have to understand

[05:08:08 - 05:08:15]
what you will achieve from the analysis

[05:08:11 - 05:08:16]
so first you have to understand the data

[05:08:15 - 05:08:19]
like how many columns do you have in the

[05:08:16 - 05:08:21]
data how many rows do you have in your

[05:08:19 - 05:08:25]
data your data is all about

[05:08:21 - 05:08:28]
what second is data loading so load the

[05:08:25 - 05:08:29]
data into suitable structure to begin

[05:08:28 - 05:08:32]
the

[05:08:29 - 05:08:36]
analysis then after data exploration and

[05:08:32 - 05:08:37]
understanding that covers summary that

[05:08:36 - 05:08:40]
cover missing values that cover

[05:08:37 - 05:08:43]
duplicacy as well like some if duplicate

[05:08:40 - 05:08:45]
values are there that we have to remove

[05:08:43 - 05:08:48]
then univariate analysis by variate

[05:08:45 - 05:08:51]
analysis now what all are these

[05:08:48 - 05:08:54]
basically first is data summary that in

[05:08:51 - 05:08:57]
this we'll get a summary of the data to

[05:08:54 - 05:09:01]
understand it structure type and basic

[05:08:57 - 05:09:03]
statistic so basically it's about to

[05:09:01 - 05:09:06]
understand the whole structure of data

[05:09:03 - 05:09:09]
set on which we're going to analyze so

[05:09:06 - 05:09:11]
it covers basically how many rows to you

[05:09:09 - 05:09:15]
have in the data set how many columns do

[05:09:11 - 05:09:18]
you have in the data set and uh the mean

[05:09:15 - 05:09:21]
of the uh columns and the median of the

[05:09:18 - 05:09:23]
column the standard deviation because

[05:09:21 - 05:09:25]
these all are very important factors

[05:09:23 - 05:09:29]
that should be covered during analysis

[05:09:25 - 05:09:30]
second step is missing values so

[05:09:29 - 05:09:33]
basically this missing value basically

[05:09:30 - 05:09:36]
what is about to check if there any

[05:09:33 - 05:09:38]
missing values are present in the data

[05:09:36 - 05:09:40]
if missing values are there you will not

[05:09:38 - 05:09:43]
get the

[05:09:40 - 05:09:46]
Clarity at the end of prediction at the

[05:09:43 - 05:09:49]
end of modeling the data after modeling

[05:09:46 - 05:09:50]
the data you will not get the exact

[05:09:49 - 05:09:54]
output you will not get the exact

[05:09:50 - 05:09:56]
prediction so missing value should not

[05:09:54 - 05:09:59]
be there if missing values are there for

[05:09:56 - 05:10:01]
that we will follow another process that

[05:09:59 - 05:10:04]
we'll discuss later after that comes

[05:10:01 - 05:10:06]
univariate analysis but before that I

[05:10:04 - 05:10:08]
want to add one more point over here

[05:10:06 - 05:10:10]
which we are not getting in this but

[05:10:08 - 05:10:14]
that should be what

[05:10:10 - 05:10:17]
duplicacy so if suppose in a column we

[05:10:14 - 05:10:19]
have duplicate data same data but that

[05:10:17 - 05:10:22]
should not be duplicate okay that should

[05:10:19 - 05:10:26]
be SE different so in that case we have

[05:10:22 - 05:10:28]
to impute that duplicate rows as well so

[05:10:26 - 05:10:31]
that also we will check and then after

[05:10:28 - 05:10:34]
we come to univariate analysis analyzing

[05:10:31 - 05:10:37]
single variable basically analyzing each

[05:10:34 - 05:10:39]
column each variable that comes under

[05:10:37 - 05:10:42]
univariate for that we have lot of

[05:10:39 - 05:10:44]
charts through which we can analyze and

[05:10:42 - 05:10:46]
then after by variate analysis using

[05:10:44 - 05:10:48]
different different plots we can analyze

[05:10:46 - 05:10:49]
the bivariate analysis which is

[05:10:48 - 05:10:52]
basically what analyzing the

[05:10:49 - 05:10:54]
relationship between two variable so if

[05:10:52 - 05:10:57]
you are analyzing a single variable for

[05:10:54 - 05:10:59]
an example uh a single column okay like

[05:10:57 - 05:11:02]
name if you want to analyze the name of

[05:10:59 - 05:11:04]
the cars okay different different cars

[05:11:02 - 05:11:06]
we have suppose in the car mpg data set

[05:11:04 - 05:11:09]
if you want to analyze how many cards we

[05:11:06 - 05:11:12]
have and suppose if you want to

[05:11:09 - 05:11:14]
understand that uh miles per gallon like

[05:11:12 - 05:11:17]
that particular column what we will

[05:11:14 - 05:11:19]
going to see after this so single

[05:11:17 - 05:11:20]
variable if you want to analyze that

[05:11:19 - 05:11:22]
will come under uni variable if you want

[05:11:20 - 05:11:23]
to compare between two variable if you

[05:11:22 - 05:11:25]
want to check the relationship between

[05:11:23 - 05:11:27]
two variable in that case we'll follow

[05:11:25 - 05:11:29]
the B variant analysis for that also we

[05:11:27 - 05:11:33]
have various plots through which we can

[05:11:29 - 05:11:35]
perform this analysis next step is data

[05:11:33 - 05:11:38]
cleaning so basically data cleaning is

[05:11:35 - 05:11:40]
what data cleaning same if you have some

[05:11:38 - 05:11:42]
missing value if you have some duplicate

[05:11:40 - 05:11:44]
values so we have to clean the data

[05:11:42 - 05:11:46]
because once you will clean the data

[05:11:44 - 05:11:48]
then only you will be able to get the

[05:11:46 - 05:11:51]
correct prediction then only you will be

[05:11:48 - 05:11:53]
able to model the data and you can model

[05:11:51 - 05:11:55]
the data but the thing is you will not

[05:11:53 - 05:11:57]
be able to get the correct prediction

[05:11:55 - 05:12:00]
based on that modeling of data so here

[05:11:57 - 05:12:03]
before the data modeling we have to

[05:12:00 - 05:12:06]
clean the data properly so here first

[05:12:03 - 05:12:08]
step comes handling missing values

[05:12:06 - 05:12:11]
imputing or removing missing value

[05:12:08 - 05:12:16]
either you can remove or you can impute

[05:12:11 - 05:12:18]
with average value mode or median so

[05:12:16 - 05:12:21]
basically here it depends on the data

[05:12:18 - 05:12:23]
the values if they are very important if

[05:12:21 - 05:12:26]
we cannot remove those values then there

[05:12:23 - 05:12:28]
we have to impute with some other values

[05:12:26 - 05:12:30]
and if it is okay to remove those

[05:12:28 - 05:12:32]
missing values then we can remove and it

[05:12:30 - 05:12:34]
depends on the data set what we are

[05:12:32 - 05:12:37]
using there and the values are very

[05:12:34 - 05:12:40]
important so we will keep that and we'll

[05:12:37 - 05:12:42]
impute those missing values with some

[05:12:40 - 05:12:44]
other statistical value basically next

[05:12:42 - 05:12:46]
is outlier

[05:12:44 - 05:12:49]
treatment identifying and treating

[05:12:46 - 05:12:52]
outliers if necessary so basically what

[05:12:49 - 05:12:55]
is outlier over here the value which is

[05:12:52 - 05:12:59]
completely different if we compare with

[05:12:55 - 05:13:02]
other rest of values so uh here if some

[05:12:59 - 05:13:05]
outliers are there so that also we have

[05:13:02 - 05:13:07]
to treat so the next point in data

[05:13:05 - 05:13:09]
cleaning is data transformation so data

[05:13:07 - 05:13:12]
transformation is what conver converting

[05:13:09 - 05:13:15]
data into required format now what is

[05:13:12 - 05:13:18]
this basically here data transformation

[05:13:15 - 05:13:22]
when we required this for an example if

[05:13:18 - 05:13:24]
you have a column with the name name the

[05:13:22 - 05:13:28]
name should be in the form of string

[05:13:24 - 05:13:32]
data type correct but if the data type

[05:13:28 - 05:13:34]
of that particular column is an integer

[05:13:32 - 05:13:37]
so basically the data type of that

[05:13:34 - 05:13:42]
column is integer obviously we should

[05:13:37 - 05:13:45]
change that to string so if the data is

[05:13:42 - 05:13:47]
not into the required format so there we

[05:13:45 - 05:13:49]
have to transform that data so these

[05:13:47 - 05:13:52]
three steps actually comes under data

[05:13:49 - 05:13:54]
cleaning process after that we'll do

[05:13:52 - 05:13:57]
feature engineering creating new

[05:13:54 - 05:14:00]
features that might help in analysis of

[05:13:57 - 05:14:03]
modeling that will understand properly

[05:14:00 - 05:14:06]
when we perform these

[05:14:03 - 05:14:09]
steps then after comes data

[05:14:06 - 05:14:12]
visualization so in that we visualize

[05:14:09 - 05:14:15]
the data using various charts as I said

[05:14:12 - 05:14:19]
earlier univariate analysis bivariate

[05:14:15 - 05:14:21]
analysis so that actually these analysis

[05:14:19 - 05:14:24]
we generally perform through

[05:14:21 - 05:14:26]
visualization by Vis visualizing

[05:14:24 - 05:14:28]
different different various plot and

[05:14:26 - 05:14:30]
here visualization distribution using

[05:14:28 - 05:14:32]
histogram bar chart we can do and

[05:14:30 - 05:14:34]
visualization relationship that we can

[05:14:32 - 05:14:37]
do using scatter plot correlation

[05:14:34 - 05:14:40]
matrices so here univariate analysis we

[05:14:37 - 05:14:43]
can perform through histogram bar chart

[05:14:40 - 05:14:45]
and if you want to understand the

[05:14:43 - 05:14:48]
relationship between two variables

[05:14:45 - 05:14:51]
basically that we call uh bate analysis

[05:14:48 - 05:14:54]
so that you can do that you can perform

[05:14:51 - 05:14:57]
using scatter plot using heat map also

[05:14:54 - 05:15:00]
using correlation metrices now the next

[05:14:57 - 05:15:03]
step comes statistical analysis

[05:15:00 - 05:15:05]
performing a statistical test to

[05:15:03 - 05:15:08]
relationship significance Etc model

[05:15:05 - 05:15:10]
building is the next step there we will

[05:15:08 - 05:15:12]
build predictive model using machine

[05:15:10 - 05:15:15]
learning or statistical methods so

[05:15:12 - 05:15:17]
basically it depends on the data like

[05:15:15 - 05:15:19]
which type of data you are using So

[05:15:17 - 05:15:22]
based on that we'll perform we'll use

[05:15:19 - 05:15:26]
relevant uh model so next is

[05:15:22 - 05:15:27]
interpretation after modeling the data

[05:15:26 - 05:15:30]
we'll get the predictions we'll get the

[05:15:27 - 05:15:32]
final output and based on that we're

[05:15:30 - 05:15:36]
going to interpret basically the

[05:15:32 - 05:15:39]
conclusion what is the end result of the

[05:15:36 - 05:15:41]
whole process what we have performed

[05:15:39 - 05:15:42]
then after report and communicate

[05:15:41 - 05:15:45]
findings basically presenting the

[05:15:42 - 05:15:48]
finding in a clear and understandable

[05:15:45 - 05:15:50]
manner to stakeholder basically is uh

[05:15:48 - 05:15:52]
like to whom you going to report that

[05:15:50 - 05:15:53]
whole analysis so to them it should be

[05:15:52 - 05:15:55]
very clear because you know the data

[05:15:53 - 05:15:57]
analysis might be possible that person

[05:15:55 - 05:15:59]
to whom you are going to show that

[05:15:57 - 05:16:00]
complete picture you might not

[05:15:59 - 05:16:04]
understand the process what you have

[05:16:00 - 05:16:06]
followed so you have to present in a

[05:16:04 - 05:16:09]
very clear and in a very precise manner

[05:16:06 - 05:16:11]
basically the outcome so these are all

[05:16:09 - 05:16:14]
are the process which comes under data

[05:16:11 - 05:16:17]
analysis and we will follow this process

[05:16:14 - 05:16:20]
and step by step we'll understand how to

[05:16:17 - 05:16:23]
perform this so now the next step is as

[05:16:20 - 05:16:24]
we have already discussed about uh the

[05:16:23 - 05:16:26]
process like how to perform data

[05:16:24 - 05:16:29]
analysis all the steps we have

[05:16:26 - 05:16:32]
understood we'll perform those steps uh

[05:16:29 - 05:16:35]
one by one and the first under that

[05:16:32 - 05:16:36]
process is how to load the data set and

[05:16:35 - 05:16:39]
we'll understand about the whole data

[05:16:36 - 05:16:41]
what we will going to analyze

[05:16:39 - 05:16:45]
before we do that first we click on

[05:16:41 - 05:16:49]
upload file and then we'll upload the

[05:16:45 - 05:16:52]
data set so here our data set is car mpg

[05:16:49 - 05:16:55]
we don't know as of now what is

[05:16:52 - 05:16:57]
basically this car MPGs and what is all

[05:16:55 - 05:17:00]
about after uploading the data set we're

[05:16:57 - 05:17:03]
going to understand by using the prompt

[05:17:00 - 05:17:04]
we're going to ask chat jpt a few

[05:17:03 - 05:17:08]
prompts based on that we'll get an

[05:17:04 - 05:17:10]
output so first prompt we're going to uh

[05:17:08 - 05:17:12]
enter over here is so as you can see

[05:17:10 - 05:17:14]
here we have uploaded the data set now

[05:17:12 - 05:17:17]
we'll understand about this data first

[05:17:14 - 05:17:20]
so before that uh we'll going to enter a

[05:17:17 - 05:17:22]
prompt here we are giving a prompt The

[05:17:20 - 05:17:24]
Prompt is basically what we want to know

[05:17:22 - 05:17:26]
through chat GPT what we want to

[05:17:24 - 05:17:29]
understand through CH GPT here we are

[05:17:26 - 05:17:31]
asking that load the car mpg data set

[05:17:29 - 05:17:33]
which we have uploaded and display the

[05:17:31 - 05:17:35]
first 10 rows what information is

[05:17:33 - 05:17:38]
contained in this data set so let's

[05:17:35 - 05:17:40]
enter this and let's see what output

[05:17:38 - 05:17:40]
we'll get over here

[05:17:47 - 05:17:53]
so you can see that we are getting the

[05:17:49 - 05:17:56]
python code also here and uh you can see

[05:17:53 - 05:18:00]
here that using this head

[05:17:56 - 05:18:03]
function we are getting the output and

[05:18:00 - 05:18:06]
parall we are getting the information of

[05:18:03 - 05:18:09]
all the variables which we have in the

[05:18:06 - 05:18:12]
required data set that is car mpg so

[05:18:09 - 05:18:15]
first is what we have asked we have

[05:18:12 - 05:18:18]
asked to load the data set so chat jpt

[05:18:15 - 05:18:20]
first will load the data set and we were

[05:18:18 - 05:18:23]
asking over here that display the first

[05:18:20 - 05:18:24]
end rows so by using this head

[05:18:23 - 05:18:27]
function

[05:18:24 - 05:18:30]
the output will be here will show you

[05:18:27 - 05:18:33]
the 10 starting rows of the data so we

[05:18:30 - 05:18:35]
are getting the starting 10 rows

[05:18:33 - 05:18:37]
simultaneously we'll apply this code in

[05:18:35 - 05:18:39]
Jupiter also that whether we'll get the

[05:18:37 - 05:18:42]
correct output in jupyter Notebook b or

[05:18:39 - 05:18:43]
not so that also we will check but as of

[05:18:42 - 05:18:46]
now first we'll discuss what we are

[05:18:43 - 05:18:48]
getting as an output over here so now as

[05:18:46 - 05:18:50]
we can see we are getting starting 10

[05:18:48 - 05:18:53]
rows now we're going to understand the

[05:18:50 - 05:18:58]
whole data set so this complete car mpg

[05:18:53 - 05:19:01]
data set is having uh 10 columns 10

[05:18:58 - 05:19:04]
variables basically first is MPG miles

[05:19:01 - 05:19:07]
per gallon that is fuel efficiency then

[05:19:04 - 05:19:10]
after cylinder that is c y l number of

[05:19:07 - 05:19:12]
cylinders in the engine then after this

[05:19:10 - 05:19:16]
that is engine displacement which is in

[05:19:12 - 05:19:18]
cubic inches then HP that is horsepower

[05:19:16 - 05:19:21]
then WT that is weight of the car which

[05:19:18 - 05:19:24]
is in pounds after that ACC that is

[05:19:21 - 05:19:29]
acceleration second required to reach 60

[05:19:24 - 05:19:32]
MPH next is yr that is model ear as a

[05:19:29 - 05:19:36]
two-digit number example 70 to 1970

[05:19:32 - 05:19:39]
basically 1970 over here it would be 70

[05:19:36 - 05:19:41]
so next is origin that is origin it

[05:19:39 - 05:19:43]
might represent different region or

[05:19:41 - 05:19:47]
countries then after car type that is

[05:19:43 - 05:19:50]
type of car for which we are doing this

[05:19:47 - 05:19:52]
analysis so type of car example zero

[05:19:50 - 05:19:55]
might represent one category and one

[05:19:52 - 05:19:58]
might represent another car name the

[05:19:55 - 05:20:01]
last variable that is name of the car

[05:19:58 - 05:20:04]
which basically include uh make and

[05:20:01 - 05:20:05]
model now this data set could be used

[05:20:04 - 05:20:06]
for various analysis such as

[05:20:05 - 05:20:08]
understanding the relationship between

[05:20:06 - 05:20:10]
fuel efficiency and other attributes or

[05:20:08 - 05:20:12]
classify car based on their

[05:20:10 - 05:20:13]
characteristics here what we will going

[05:20:12 - 05:20:16]
to understand we're going to understand

[05:20:13 - 05:20:19]
the relationship between fuel efficiency

[05:20:16 - 05:20:22]
and other attributes okay so let's um

[05:20:19 - 05:20:24]
try this code in Jupiter as well let's

[05:20:22 - 05:20:28]
see that whether we are getting the

[05:20:24 - 05:20:30]
output there or not so when we copy this

[05:20:28 - 05:20:32]
code you can copy directly from here as

[05:20:30 - 05:20:34]
well when you click over here it will

[05:20:32 - 05:20:38]
get copied and then you can paste this

[05:20:34 - 05:20:40]
code in jupyter Notebook so you can see

[05:20:38 - 05:20:42]
I have already pasted the code I have

[05:20:40 - 05:20:44]
uploaded the data set over here I've

[05:20:42 - 05:20:46]
given the data set name which should be

[05:20:44 - 05:20:51]
in CSV format over here because we are

[05:20:46 - 05:20:53]
using the command rore CSV so if you are

[05:20:51 - 05:20:56]
uploading the data set uh which is with

[05:20:53 - 05:20:59]
the extension of CSV then there you have

[05:20:56 - 05:21:01]
to use this command that is pd. rore CSV

[05:20:59 - 05:21:05]
and then you can see that we are getting

[05:21:01 - 05:21:08]
all these uh column names over here now

[05:21:05 - 05:21:10]
the next is over here you can see that

[05:21:08 - 05:21:14]
we want to check the starting first

[05:21:10 - 05:21:18]
rowes so what code for that so basically

[05:21:14 - 05:21:22]
here we have this code the car _ data.

[05:21:18 - 05:21:25]
head so when I paste over here that

[05:21:22 - 05:21:27]
code let's see what outcome we'll get

[05:21:25 - 05:21:30]
over

[05:21:27 - 05:21:34]
here so here we are getting what first

[05:21:30 - 05:21:36]
is uh this one that whatever the code we

[05:21:34 - 05:21:39]
have at last computer will display that

[05:21:36 - 05:21:42]
only so here the last Cod is do head

[05:21:39 - 05:21:43]
function we are uh giving and based on

[05:21:42 - 05:21:45]
that we are getting starting 10 rows

[05:21:43 - 05:21:48]
because head function is basically G

[05:21:45 - 05:21:51]
starting 10 rows if you want to see more

[05:21:48 - 05:21:54]
rows just enter the value inside the

[05:21:51 - 05:21:58]
bracket so if I want to check uh let's

[05:21:54 - 05:22:02]
say 20 rows so if I enter this here I'm

[05:21:58 - 05:22:05]
getting 0 to 19 that means 20 rows data

[05:22:02 - 05:22:08]
so head function is basically what to

[05:22:05 - 05:22:09]
display the number of rows based on the

[05:22:08 - 05:22:10]
value what what you are giving inside

[05:22:09 - 05:22:15]
the

[05:22:10 - 05:22:17]
parenthesis now next is what so next is

[05:22:15 - 05:22:19]
to display the data type of all the

[05:22:17 - 05:22:21]
variables from the above data set

[05:22:19 - 05:22:24]
because we want to know the type of the

[05:22:21 - 05:22:27]
data which we are using in the data set

[05:22:24 - 05:22:29]
so for that we'll ask chat jpt by using

[05:22:27 - 05:22:33]
this prompt you can enter you can give

[05:22:29 - 05:22:35]
any prompt as per your ease so as if now

[05:22:33 - 05:22:37]
I am giving over here that display the

[05:22:35 - 05:22:40]
data type of all the variables from the

[05:22:37 - 05:22:42]
above data set so when we enter this

[05:22:40 - 05:22:45]
prompt we'll get some output so let's

[05:22:42 - 05:22:48]
see what we are getting over here as an

[05:22:45 - 05:22:52]
output I'm getting the code Al also

[05:22:48 - 05:22:54]
which is in Python carore MPG data which

[05:22:52 - 05:22:58]
is the data frame name and do D type D

[05:22:54 - 05:23:00]
types is the um function basically uh

[05:22:58 - 05:23:04]
used to understand or used to get the

[05:23:00 - 05:23:07]
output Based on data type so you can see

[05:23:04 - 05:23:11]
here we are getting the result that

[05:23:07 - 05:23:13]
first variable is of float another is of

[05:23:11 - 05:23:16]
integer another one is again float one

[05:23:13 - 05:23:18]
is of object that is HP that is House

[05:23:16 - 05:23:22]
part then after weight is of integer

[05:23:18 - 05:23:24]
data type and so on so here you are

[05:23:22 - 05:23:26]
getting a complete explanation also and

[05:23:24 - 05:23:29]
the data type of the variable in the car

[05:23:26 - 05:23:32]
M data set are as follows so here we are

[05:23:29 - 05:23:35]
getting all these complete

[05:23:32 - 05:23:37]
explanation what next Chad GPT is

[05:23:35 - 05:23:40]
showing here is it's worth nothing that

[05:23:37 - 05:23:43]
HP column is of type object which might

[05:23:40 - 05:23:45]
indicate some irregularities in the data

[05:23:43 - 05:23:47]
such as missing value or non-numeric

[05:23:45 - 05:23:50]
entries if you need to perform numerical

[05:23:47 - 05:23:52]
analysis on this column we have to clean

[05:23:50 - 05:23:55]
and convert it to the numeric data type

[05:23:52 - 05:23:58]
now why we are getting this because if

[05:23:55 - 05:24:00]
you want to perform analysis and if the

[05:23:58 - 05:24:03]
analysis is numeric based so in that

[05:24:00 - 05:24:06]
case we have to convert that and if you

[05:24:03 - 05:24:08]
are converting a variable into some

[05:24:06 - 05:24:11]
other data type before that you have to

[05:24:08 - 05:24:14]
check whether we have missing values or

[05:24:11 - 05:24:16]
not so for that we will going to um

[05:24:14 - 05:24:20]
apply some other code there and let's

[05:24:16 - 05:24:22]
see what output we'll get at that stage

[05:24:20 - 05:24:24]
as of now we are skipping this part

[05:24:22 - 05:24:26]
because any which ways we're going to

[05:24:24 - 05:24:29]
check whether we have missing values or

[05:24:26 - 05:24:32]
not and during that process we'll check

[05:24:29 - 05:24:34]
this column as well to understand

[05:24:32 - 05:24:37]
whether how to impute the missing values

[05:24:34 - 05:24:38]
and not so yeah here we are checking all

[05:24:37 - 05:24:41]
the column

[05:24:38 - 05:24:42]
and simultaneously we are checking the

[05:24:41 - 05:24:47]
type of the

[05:24:42 - 05:24:50]
data so this is uh the final output if I

[05:24:47 - 05:24:52]
apply this code in Jupiter notebook

[05:24:50 - 05:24:54]
let's see whether we are getting a

[05:24:52 - 05:24:58]
correct output or not so already we have

[05:24:54 - 05:25:01]
over here this code I'll paste it over

[05:24:58 - 05:25:04]
here when I will run this code so after

[05:25:01 - 05:25:06]
applying this code I we can see that we

[05:25:04 - 05:25:08]
are getting the output and here what we

[05:25:06 - 05:25:11]
are getting as an output we are getting

[05:25:08 - 05:25:15]
all the type of the datas uh based on

[05:25:11 - 05:25:19]
the code which we have given here so MPG

[05:25:15 - 05:25:22]
is float data type cylinder is of

[05:25:19 - 05:25:26]
integer data type same HP is of object

[05:25:22 - 05:25:28]
data type and uh so on so yeah this is

[05:25:26 - 05:25:31]
correct and as of now whatever we are

[05:25:28 - 05:25:34]
getting code through chat jpt showing

[05:25:31 - 05:25:38]
the correct output now let's understand

[05:25:34 - 05:25:39]
the next step so now the next step is if

[05:25:38 - 05:25:43]
you want to

[05:25:39 - 05:25:46]
check is there any duplicate rows so

[05:25:43 - 05:25:48]
that is also a very important uh step

[05:25:46 - 05:25:50]
during analysis duplicacy should not be

[05:25:48 - 05:25:53]
there missing value should not be there

[05:25:50 - 05:25:55]
so as a prompt I'm giving here display

[05:25:53 - 05:25:57]
the duplicate rows from the above data

[05:25:55 - 05:26:00]
set using python why we are specifically

[05:25:57 - 05:26:02]
mentioned over here python because we

[05:26:00 - 05:26:04]
want python code as of now you we so

[05:26:02 - 05:26:07]
that's why we are specifically mentioned

[05:26:04 - 05:26:09]
here using python when I enter this code

[05:26:07 - 05:26:11]
I'm getting some output let's see what

[05:26:09 - 05:26:11]
output we are

[05:26:16 - 05:26:23]
getting okay so as a code what we are

[05:26:19 - 05:26:25]
getting over here that finding basically

[05:26:23 - 05:26:27]
here first we have to create a variable

[05:26:25 - 05:26:30]
obviously so the name of the variable in

[05:26:27 - 05:26:33]
which the output will get stored is

[05:26:30 - 05:26:36]
duplicate underscore rul and we are

[05:26:33 - 05:26:39]
getting the code over here that from the

[05:26:36 - 05:26:42]
data car mpg data

[05:26:39 - 05:26:45]
get the duplicate values so for that we

[05:26:42 - 05:26:48]
are using here duplicated function you

[05:26:45 - 05:26:50]
can see one parenthesis over here so if

[05:26:48 - 05:26:52]
a parenthesis is there that means that

[05:26:50 - 05:26:54]
is a function so with duplicated we have

[05:26:52 - 05:26:56]
a parenthesis that means duplicated is a

[05:26:54 - 05:27:00]
function which we are applying on the

[05:26:56 - 05:27:03]
data and that basically take out all the

[05:27:00 - 05:27:04]
duplicate values we show you complete

[05:27:03 - 05:27:06]
duplicate values whatever we have

[05:27:04 - 05:27:09]
whatever duplicate values are present in

[05:27:06 - 05:27:12]
the data set so so uh when it will get

[05:27:09 - 05:27:14]
stored to duplicate uncore row then we

[05:27:12 - 05:27:17]
will call that variable and we'll get

[05:27:14 - 05:27:21]
the output as an output here what we are

[05:27:17 - 05:27:23]
getting that uh empty data frame columns

[05:27:21 - 05:27:26]
are these many columns whatever we have

[05:27:23 - 05:27:28]
already in the data set and as an

[05:27:26 - 05:27:31]
interpretation as a final result what CH

[05:27:28 - 05:27:33]
GP is showing here that the Carm data

[05:27:31 - 05:27:36]
set doesn't contain any duplicate rows

[05:27:33 - 05:27:40]
all the entries in the data set are

[05:27:36 - 05:27:41]
unique then there is no duplicacy so we

[05:27:40 - 05:27:44]
can go ahead with this data set as of

[05:27:41 - 05:27:46]
now if you have any specific question so

[05:27:44 - 05:27:48]
you can ask so now I really want to

[05:27:46 - 05:27:52]
check whether we are getting the same

[05:27:48 - 05:27:55]
output when I apply the same code in the

[05:27:52 - 05:27:58]
Jupiter so when I copy this code I'll

[05:27:55 - 05:28:00]
paste over here let's see what output

[05:27:58 - 05:28:03]
we'll

[05:28:00 - 05:28:07]
get so there is nothing basically we do

[05:28:03 - 05:28:10]
not have any duplicate rules okay let's

[05:28:07 - 05:28:13]
go ahead with other step and we'll apply

[05:28:10 - 05:28:16]
one more prompt

[05:28:13 - 05:28:19]
here now the next prompt I'll give over

[05:28:16 - 05:28:21]
here is display the

[05:28:19 - 05:28:23]
categorical and continuous variable in

[05:28:21 - 05:28:26]
the data set using python why because I

[05:28:23 - 05:28:28]
want to know that how many categorical

[05:28:26 - 05:28:30]
variables do we have here how many

[05:28:28 - 05:28:32]
continuous variables do we have here

[05:28:30 - 05:28:35]
when I enter this

[05:28:32 - 05:28:38]
prompt let's see what output we are

[05:28:35 - 05:28:38]
getting

[05:28:54 - 05:28:59]
okay so as we have asked over here that

[05:28:57 - 05:29:01]
displ the categorical and continuous

[05:28:59 - 05:29:02]
variable in the data set using python we

[05:29:01 - 05:29:05]
are not asking what is categorical and

[05:29:02 - 05:29:08]
continuous but still we are getting

[05:29:05 - 05:29:10]
output uh based on the explanation that

[05:29:08 - 05:29:12]
gbt is giving over here is that

[05:29:10 - 05:29:15]
categorical variable are those that can

[05:29:12 - 05:29:18]
take on one of limited set of values

[05:29:15 - 05:29:20]
representing categories or labels while

[05:29:18 - 05:29:23]
continuers can take on an infinite set

[05:29:20 - 05:29:25]
of values within a range based on the

[05:29:23 - 05:29:26]
data type and the nature of the variable

[05:29:25 - 05:29:28]
we can identify categorical and

[05:29:26 - 05:29:30]
continuous variable so categorical

[05:29:28 - 05:29:33]
variables are basically what variable

[05:29:30 - 05:29:36]
that are typically integer or object

[05:29:33 - 05:29:38]
type and represent discrete categories

[05:29:36 - 05:29:40]
and continuous is basically what

[05:29:38 - 05:29:44]
which are typically float type and

[05:29:40 - 05:29:47]
represent continuous measurement so now

[05:29:44 - 05:29:49]
here you can see the code based on the

[05:29:47 - 05:29:52]
prompt what we have entered so

[05:29:49 - 05:29:55]
categorical variable CH GPT has created

[05:29:52 - 05:29:58]
in which we are storing the output and

[05:29:55 - 05:30:01]
output based on what that select data

[05:29:58 - 05:30:03]
type include object in so we are asking

[05:30:01 - 05:30:08]
if

[05:30:03 - 05:30:12]
the values are of object and integer

[05:30:08 - 05:30:15]
store that column names in this variable

[05:30:12 - 05:30:18]
that is categorical variable if the

[05:30:15 - 05:30:21]
variables are of float data type then

[05:30:18 - 05:30:23]
you store those column names in the form

[05:30:21 - 05:30:27]
of list because here you can see that we

[05:30:23 - 05:30:29]
are uh giving a code that to list so

[05:30:27 - 05:30:31]
basically the columns will convert to

[05:30:29 - 05:30:34]
list and that will get stored where in

[05:30:31 - 05:30:37]
continuous variable variable basically

[05:30:34 - 05:30:40]
okay so now here removing the column

[05:30:37 - 05:30:44]
that are known to be continuous but are

[05:30:40 - 05:30:46]
represented as integer that is ear so

[05:30:44 - 05:30:50]
categorical variable do remove ear from

[05:30:46 - 05:30:52]
the list now when we display uh when we

[05:30:50 - 05:30:54]
ask categorical variable and continuous

[05:30:52 - 05:30:57]
variable what we'll get as an output

[05:30:54 - 05:30:58]
this is the output So based on the data

[05:30:57 - 05:31:00]
type and context categorical variables

[05:30:58 - 05:31:03]
are these

[05:31:00 - 05:31:06]
many are the categorical variables and

[05:31:03 - 05:31:07]
these three are continuous variable

[05:31:06 - 05:31:09]
because based on continuous and

[05:31:07 - 05:31:12]
categorical we'll perform the data

[05:31:09 - 05:31:15]
analysis let's apply this code

[05:31:12 - 05:31:17]
once and let's see what output we are

[05:31:15 - 05:31:17]
getting in jupyter

[05:31:21 - 05:31:27]
Notebook okay so first is categorical so

[05:31:24 - 05:31:29]
first list is based on categorical

[05:31:27 - 05:31:32]
variable the another one we are asking

[05:31:29 - 05:31:36]
here continuous variable so the another

[05:31:32 - 05:31:38]
list is what of continuous variable so

[05:31:36 - 05:31:40]
we are getting a correct output over

[05:31:38 - 05:31:44]
here let's understand the

[05:31:40 - 05:31:46]
next part of data analysis whether do we

[05:31:44 - 05:31:49]
have missing values in the data set or

[05:31:46 - 05:31:51]
not or if we have then how to impute

[05:31:49 - 05:31:54]
that missing values because if we have

[05:31:51 - 05:31:57]
missing values that will impact the

[05:31:54 - 05:31:59]
final outcome so if you have missing

[05:31:57 - 05:32:02]
values in your data set so you have to

[05:31:59 - 05:32:05]
impute those missing values with some uh

[05:32:02 - 05:32:09]
other values like how that we'll

[05:32:05 - 05:32:11]
understand after this okay so the next

[05:32:09 - 05:32:13]
one is plot the distribution of the

[05:32:11 - 05:32:15]
origin variable how does the origin

[05:32:13 - 05:32:17]
affect the other feature in the data set

[05:32:15 - 05:32:19]
let's understand this also when I enter

[05:32:17 - 05:32:22]
this uh

[05:32:19 - 05:32:24]
prompt we are getting an

[05:32:22 - 05:32:27]
output the origin variable in the data

[05:32:24 - 05:32:28]
set is likely a categorical variable

[05:32:27 - 05:32:31]
representing different region or

[05:32:28 - 05:32:34]
countries of origin of for the cards we

[05:32:31 - 05:32:36]
can visualizes distribution using a bar

[05:32:34 - 05:32:38]
plot to show the frequency of each

[05:32:36 - 05:32:39]
category once we have have an

[05:32:38 - 05:32:42]
understanding of the distribution we can

[05:32:39 - 05:32:44]
further explore how the origin affects

[05:32:42 - 05:32:47]
other features in the data set like why

[05:32:44 - 05:32:50]
we are using this feature overall uh in

[05:32:47 - 05:32:52]
the data set and how it is affecting so

[05:32:50 - 05:32:54]
this is the bar

[05:32:52 - 05:32:58]
chart and showing the distribution of

[05:32:54 - 05:33:01]
car origin so 1 2 3 as we have three

[05:32:58 - 05:33:04]
values uh in the origin variable and

[05:33:01 - 05:33:08]
first is one other is two and three and

[05:33:04 - 05:33:10]
the frequency here we are getting as on

[05:33:08 - 05:33:12]
Y axis the bar prod above shows the

[05:33:10 - 05:33:14]
distribution of the origin variable in

[05:33:12 - 05:33:16]
the car mg data set and it appears that

[05:33:14 - 05:33:20]
the three values are there and with the

[05:33:16 - 05:33:23]
name one followed by origin 3 and origin

[05:33:20 - 05:33:27]
2 so origin one has higher frequency

[05:33:23 - 05:33:30]
then origin 3 and then after origin 2

[05:33:27 - 05:33:32]
let's explore how the origin affects

[05:33:30 - 05:33:33]
other feature in the data set by

[05:33:32 - 05:33:37]
summarizing some key statistic for

[05:33:33 - 05:33:38]
numerical variables and uh how we'll

[05:33:37 - 05:33:40]
understand that

[05:33:38 - 05:33:43]
there is complete explanation we'll come

[05:33:40 - 05:33:46]
back to this code also so now here you

[05:33:43 - 05:33:48]
can see we have applied mean function

[05:33:46 - 05:33:51]
and we actually want to know how this

[05:33:48 - 05:33:55]
variable is impacting okay what is the

[05:33:51 - 05:34:00]
importance on other variables so MPG

[05:33:55 - 05:34:03]
origin 3 has highest value fuel uh per

[05:34:00 - 05:34:06]
efficiency so miles per gallon so origin

[05:34:03 - 05:34:09]
three has the highest mean value

[05:34:06 - 05:34:12]
followed by origin two and origin one so

[05:34:09 - 05:34:14]
highest will be origin three we suggest

[05:34:12 - 05:34:17]
that the cars which are from the origin

[05:34:14 - 05:34:20]
three are generally more fuel efficient

[05:34:17 - 05:34:23]
if the cars are from origin 2 so they

[05:34:20 - 05:34:26]
are comparatively with origin 3 less

[05:34:23 - 05:34:30]
efficient and the origin one has the

[05:34:26 - 05:34:33]
least value so the cars which are um

[05:34:30 - 05:34:36]
from the origin 1 comparatively with

[05:34:33 - 05:34:38]
origin 3 and two has less fuel efficient

[05:34:36 - 05:34:41]
cars okay so next is cylinder

[05:34:38 - 05:34:44]
displacement and horsepower so cars from

[05:34:41 - 05:34:47]
origin one have high range value and uh

[05:34:44 - 05:34:49]
other one is car from origin 2 and three

[05:34:47 - 05:34:52]
have a smaller Engine with few cylinders

[05:34:49 - 05:34:57]
and lower H bar that's how this origin

[05:34:52 - 05:34:59]
is um important for understanding the

[05:34:57 - 05:35:01]
other features uh based on different

[05:34:59 - 05:35:04]
different origin we have different

[05:35:01 - 05:35:08]
different values of each column and that

[05:35:04 - 05:35:10]
we are getting through this summary so

[05:35:08 - 05:35:12]
how we are getting this summary by using

[05:35:10 - 05:35:15]
this code when we apply this code uh

[05:35:12 - 05:35:17]
Group by origin do mean function mean

[05:35:15 - 05:35:20]
function will give the mean value of

[05:35:17 - 05:35:23]
origin and column wise the other column

[05:35:20 - 05:35:27]
wise here you can see MPG of origin 1 is

[05:35:23 - 05:35:30]
20 cylinder is 6.2 so the highest value

[05:35:27 - 05:35:33]
of miles per gallon is for origin three

[05:35:30 - 05:35:35]
then after 2 and then after one we have

[05:35:33 - 05:35:37]
already discussed what does it mean

[05:35:35 - 05:35:39]
let's copy this code from here and apply

[05:35:37 - 05:35:42]
and just

[05:35:39 - 05:35:45]
check that whether we are getting the

[05:35:42 - 05:35:47]
output yes we are getting the correct

[05:35:45 - 05:35:51]
output what we were getting through chat

[05:35:47 - 05:35:54]
GPT and uh that's how we can understand

[05:35:51 - 05:35:57]
what that the distribution of the origin

[05:35:54 - 05:36:00]
variable and how this variable affect

[05:35:57 - 05:36:03]
the other features in the data set and

[05:36:00 - 05:36:05]
the importance of this variable so now

[05:36:03 - 05:36:07]
we're going to understand whether do we

[05:36:05 - 05:36:10]
have missing values in the data set or

[05:36:07 - 05:36:12]
not not so for that first we'll ask CH

[05:36:10 - 05:36:14]
GPT by using this prompt that identify

[05:36:12 - 05:36:17]
and handle any missing values in the car

[05:36:14 - 05:36:19]
mpg data and how did you choose to

[05:36:17 - 05:36:22]
handle them and why let's see what

[05:36:19 - 05:36:22]
output we'll get over

[05:36:26 - 05:36:34]
here so we are getting an output I want

[05:36:30 - 05:36:36]
to know what code CH GPT will display

[05:36:34 - 05:36:39]
over here for that if we have missing

[05:36:36 - 05:36:39]
values

[05:36:42 - 05:36:49]
okay so now let's understand this part

[05:36:46 - 05:36:51]
first to handle missing values we first

[05:36:49 - 05:36:54]
need to identify whether they are in the

[05:36:51 - 05:36:57]
data set or not once we have found them

[05:36:54 - 05:37:00]
we can decide on an appropriate method

[05:36:57 - 05:37:02]
to handle them based on the context of

[05:37:00 - 05:37:04]
the data if we can remove those missing

[05:37:02 - 05:37:07]
values and it will not impact the whole

[05:37:04 - 05:37:09]
data set like because of removing the

[05:37:07 - 05:37:12]
values from the data if it is not

[05:37:09 - 05:37:15]
impacting the main data set then we can

[05:37:12 - 05:37:19]
remove but if we remove the missing

[05:37:15 - 05:37:22]
values uh related roles and if it impact

[05:37:19 - 05:37:24]
the data set then there we have to use

[05:37:22 - 05:37:27]
some process that is called imputing the

[05:37:24 - 05:37:31]
missing values and that can be done by

[05:37:27 - 05:37:34]
using um some relevant code but here

[05:37:31 - 05:37:38]
first is what common strategies we have

[05:37:34 - 05:37:40]
for uh this type of issues is removing

[05:37:38 - 05:37:42]
rows that I already discussed that

[05:37:40 - 05:37:44]
deleting rows with missing values if

[05:37:42 - 05:37:47]
they are few in number and if they are

[05:37:44 - 05:37:49]
not impacting like if we remove the

[05:37:47 - 05:37:52]
values and they are not impacting the

[05:37:49 - 05:37:54]
main data set then we can remove filling

[05:37:52 - 05:37:57]
with mean and median so fing missing

[05:37:54 - 05:37:59]
values with the mean or median value of

[05:37:57 - 05:38:02]
the column suitable for continuous

[05:37:59 - 05:38:04]
variable next is filling with mode

[05:38:02 - 05:38:07]
filling missing values with the mode

[05:38:04 - 05:38:09]
most frequent value of the column

[05:38:07 - 05:38:12]
suitable for categorical variable using

[05:38:09 - 05:38:14]
interpolation interpolating values based

[05:38:12 - 05:38:17]
on surrounding data suitable for time

[05:38:14 - 05:38:19]
series or order data so basically here U

[05:38:17 - 05:38:21]
what we do if missing values are there

[05:38:19 - 05:38:24]
and if we do not want to remove those

[05:38:21 - 05:38:27]
rows which contain the missing values so

[05:38:24 - 05:38:31]
we'll impute those missing values with

[05:38:27 - 05:38:34]
mean median or mode value uh and uh then

[05:38:31 - 05:38:36]
we can proceed further here let's

[05:38:34 - 05:38:38]
understand whether do we have uh the

[05:38:36 - 05:38:41]
missing value values in our data set or

[05:38:38 - 05:38:43]
not so for that we have a code over here

[05:38:41 - 05:38:47]
missing values summary equal to car mpg

[05:38:43 - 05:38:50]
data. isnull isnull is the main function

[05:38:47 - 05:38:53]
to check whether do we have any missing

[05:38:50 - 05:38:55]
values or not suppose if we have five

[05:38:53 - 05:38:58]
missing values in one column so that

[05:38:55 - 05:39:02]
will get sum up by using sum function

[05:38:58 - 05:39:04]
and the final total number of values for

[05:39:02 - 05:39:05]
a particular column will get display as

[05:39:04 - 05:39:07]
an

[05:39:05 - 05:39:10]
output that will store in in this

[05:39:07 - 05:39:11]
variable which we have created over here

[05:39:10 - 05:39:14]
and when we call this variable we'll get

[05:39:11 - 05:39:17]
the final output so this is the main

[05:39:14 - 05:39:21]
code based on that what J GPT is showing

[05:39:17 - 05:39:24]
over here as a result is zero means we

[05:39:21 - 05:39:26]
do not have any missing values in the

[05:39:24 - 05:39:29]
columns it appears that there are no

[05:39:26 - 05:39:32]
missing values in the car mpg data set

[05:39:29 - 05:39:34]
as indicated by the summable however we

[05:39:32 - 05:39:37]
previously noticed that horse part that

[05:39:34 - 05:39:39]
is HP column has an object dat data type

[05:39:37 - 05:39:42]
which might indicate some irregularities

[05:39:39 - 05:39:44]
in the data such as non-numeric entries

[05:39:42 - 05:39:46]
so let's investigate this column to see

[05:39:44 - 05:39:49]
if there are any unusual values that

[05:39:46 - 05:39:52]
need to be handled so we have already

[05:39:49 - 05:39:54]
discussed about this column that that

[05:39:52 - 05:39:57]
column is of object data type this

[05:39:54 - 05:39:59]
column also we have to check that

[05:39:57 - 05:40:01]
whether uh this column has a missing

[05:39:59 - 05:40:04]
value or not if this column has a

[05:40:01 - 05:40:07]
missing value so we have to work on it

[05:40:04 - 05:40:11]
so the code related with this is

[05:40:07 - 05:40:14]
this one same and

[05:40:11 - 05:40:17]
um if in the object data type any

[05:40:14 - 05:40:19]
missing values is there so we'll impute

[05:40:17 - 05:40:22]
those values so here as an output we are

[05:40:19 - 05:40:23]
getting a question mark is there in the

[05:40:22 - 05:40:26]
column that means that particular row

[05:40:23 - 05:40:29]
doesn't have any value uh those rows

[05:40:26 - 05:40:32]
have only question mark instead of any

[05:40:29 - 05:40:34]
appropriate value it seems that HP

[05:40:32 - 05:40:37]
column contains some question mark that

[05:40:34 - 05:40:39]
character which likely represent missing

[05:40:37 - 05:40:44]
or unknown values these values are not

[05:40:39 - 05:40:47]
recognized as null or na n so we need to

[05:40:44 - 05:40:50]
handle them given that here what we are

[05:40:47 - 05:40:52]
getting is In output that HP is a

[05:40:50 - 05:40:53]
numerical variable representing horsep

[05:40:52 - 05:40:56]
power obviously hor power basically

[05:40:53 - 05:40:57]
should be a numerical value but a common

[05:40:56 - 05:40:59]
approach is to replace them unknown

[05:40:57 - 05:41:02]
values with the median value of the

[05:40:59 - 05:41:04]
column so let's proceed with replacing

[05:41:02 - 05:41:08]
the character with HP column with the

[05:41:04 - 05:41:11]
median value of the known horse part

[05:41:08 - 05:41:15]
values so how to convert see first is

[05:41:11 - 05:41:17]
this column is of object data type but

[05:41:15 - 05:41:19]
in general we know that house power

[05:41:17 - 05:41:24]
should be of numerical because the

[05:41:19 - 05:41:27]
values are in numbers and if we have any

[05:41:24 - 05:41:30]
column uh which showing numeric values

[05:41:27 - 05:41:33]
but the data type is uh different so

[05:41:30 - 05:41:35]
there we have to convert that column

[05:41:33 - 05:41:38]
with the correct data type so we have

[05:41:35 - 05:41:42]
already done over here with apply

[05:41:38 - 05:41:45]
function okay next is this is the

[05:41:42 - 05:41:47]
complete code what we are doing over

[05:41:45 - 05:41:51]
here is we are imputing the missing

[05:41:47 - 05:41:56]
values with the median value so when we

[05:41:51 - 05:41:58]
do that then after in HP also we are

[05:41:56 - 05:42:02]
getting zero because now we have filled

[05:41:58 - 05:42:05]
those uh unknown uh rows or missing rows

[05:42:02 - 05:42:09]
with median values of HP and because of

[05:42:05 - 05:42:11]
that we are now having no missing values

[05:42:09 - 05:42:13]
present in the data set the missing

[05:42:11 - 05:42:16]
values in the HP column have been

[05:42:13 - 05:42:18]
successfully handled and how it got

[05:42:16 - 05:42:22]
handled with the median value of the

[05:42:18 - 05:42:26]
known horsepower values that median mean

[05:42:22 - 05:42:29]
mode how uh we get these values that

[05:42:26 - 05:42:31]
we'll understand after this so now there

[05:42:29 - 05:42:34]
are no missing values or unknown values

[05:42:31 - 05:42:36]
in the car mpg data set now I chose to

[05:42:34 - 05:42:39]
handle the missing values in this way

[05:42:36 - 05:42:43]
because here CH GP is giving the reason

[05:42:39 - 05:42:46]
also that why CH GPT chose to handle

[05:42:43 - 05:42:49]
missing values in this way because

[05:42:46 - 05:42:53]
replacing with the median preserve the

[05:42:49 - 05:42:55]
central tendency of the HP distribution

[05:42:53 - 05:42:58]
the median is less sensitive to

[05:42:55 - 05:43:01]
outliers basically outliers are which is

[05:42:58 - 05:43:05]
very different from the main values what

[05:43:01 - 05:43:08]
we have in the column uh let's say HP

[05:43:05 - 05:43:10]
only so if we suppose have a b c d e

[05:43:08 - 05:43:15]
values in one column all of a sudden if

[05:43:10 - 05:43:17]
we are giving their Z right so that is

[05:43:15 - 05:43:19]
very far from The Continuous series what

[05:43:17 - 05:43:22]
we have in the column right so that Z

[05:43:19 - 05:43:25]
will consider as an outlier so here the

[05:43:22 - 05:43:28]
median is less sensitive to outliers so

[05:43:25 - 05:43:30]
it provides a more robust estimate for

[05:43:28 - 05:43:32]
filling in missing values since

[05:43:30 - 05:43:35]
horsepower is a continuous variable

[05:43:32 - 05:43:38]
using the median is a suitable method

[05:43:35 - 05:43:42]
for imputing missing values so that's

[05:43:38 - 05:43:44]
how we can impute but again we're going

[05:43:42 - 05:43:46]
to check whether based on this code we

[05:43:44 - 05:43:49]
are getting the correct output in

[05:43:46 - 05:43:54]
Jupiter notebook also so let's copy this

[05:43:49 - 05:43:54]
code first I'll copy and I'll paste it

[05:43:56 - 05:44:02]
here so now here we are getting the

[05:44:00 - 05:44:04]
output based on this code that yeah we

[05:44:02 - 05:44:06]
have missing values and that missing

[05:44:04 - 05:44:09]
value basically what in rows we have

[05:44:06 - 05:44:11]
some values with this type of character

[05:44:09 - 05:44:13]
which is not a value which is not

[05:44:11 - 05:44:15]
anything it is completely unknown value

[05:44:13 - 05:44:18]
now we have to impute this so based on

[05:44:15 - 05:44:21]
this type of character we not get a

[05:44:18 - 05:44:22]
correct prediction so the next code for

[05:44:21 - 05:44:25]
that

[05:44:22 - 05:44:28]
is to impute this

[05:44:25 - 05:44:32]
value so when I paste

[05:44:28 - 05:44:35]
here we run this code we are checking

[05:44:32 - 05:44:38]
that missing values after handling this

[05:44:35 - 05:44:41]
variable contain all the column names

[05:44:38 - 05:44:43]
from the data set and we'll show you

[05:44:41 - 05:44:46]
whether we have any missing values left

[05:44:43 - 05:44:49]
or not so here we are getting all the

[05:44:46 - 05:44:51]
names of the column and parallely we are

[05:44:49 - 05:44:54]
getting over here the number of values

[05:44:51 - 05:44:55]
if missing values are there so no there

[05:44:54 - 05:44:58]
is no missing value because we are

[05:44:55 - 05:45:00]
getting as an output zero this is the

[05:44:58 - 05:45:05]
output what we were getting in the CH

[05:45:00 - 05:45:09]
GPT also so that's how we can impute the

[05:45:05 - 05:45:12]
missing values if we have any values

[05:45:09 - 05:45:14]
which is unknown in the data set and how

[05:45:12 - 05:45:17]
to impute that that we have already

[05:45:14 - 05:45:20]
discussed we'll now move ahead with

[05:45:17 - 05:45:23]
another step so let's understand the new

[05:45:20 - 05:45:26]
step for data analysis so now we have

[05:45:23 - 05:45:29]
covered till now unival analysis bi

[05:45:26 - 05:45:31]
analysis we have seen that summary

[05:45:29 - 05:45:35]
statistics and we have checked that what

[05:45:31 - 05:45:37]
data set is all about everything we have

[05:45:35 - 05:45:41]
discussed till now now we're going to

[05:45:37 - 05:45:42]
apply a model on the data set to predict

[05:45:41 - 05:45:45]
the fuel

[05:45:42 - 05:45:47]
efficiency so here I'm using a prompt

[05:45:45 - 05:45:50]
using the car ampure data build a

[05:45:47 - 05:45:52]
regression model to predict fuel

[05:45:50 - 05:45:55]
efficiency what feature did you include

[05:45:52 - 05:45:58]
and how well does the model perform when

[05:45:55 - 05:46:00]
I enter this prompt as I'm going to

[05:45:58 - 05:46:03]
building a model on my data set to predi

[05:46:00 - 05:46:05]
the fuel efficiency so building a

[05:46:03 - 05:46:07]
regression model to predict fuel

[05:46:05 - 05:46:10]
efficiency involves selecting features

[05:46:07 - 05:46:14]
so before we uh discuss

[05:46:10 - 05:46:16]
the regression model over here we'll ask

[05:46:14 - 05:46:20]
chity that why we are using here

[05:46:16 - 05:46:22]
regression model okay when I enter this

[05:46:20 - 05:46:25]
I'll get some output let's discuss that

[05:46:22 - 05:46:26]
also regression model are used to

[05:46:25 - 05:46:28]
understand and quantify the relationship

[05:46:26 - 05:46:31]
between dependent and one or more

[05:46:28 - 05:46:33]
independent variables so one would be

[05:46:31 - 05:46:35]
Target variable on which we're going to

[05:46:33 - 05:46:38]
do the prediction so here which one is

[05:46:35 - 05:46:40]
the target variable which one is the

[05:46:38 - 05:46:43]
independent variable that also we'll

[05:46:40 - 05:46:46]
discuss now we are using here regression

[05:46:43 - 05:46:49]
model because of some reasons first is

[05:46:46 - 05:46:52]
nature of the dependent variable that is

[05:46:49 - 05:46:54]
MPG MPG is the target variable we going

[05:46:52 - 05:46:57]
to predict the fuel efficiency over here

[05:46:54 - 05:47:00]
so that is the target variable the

[05:46:57 - 05:47:02]
target variable MPG is a continuous

[05:47:00 - 05:47:05]
numerical variable regression model are

[05:47:02 - 05:47:07]
designed to predict continuous outcome

[05:47:05 - 05:47:10]
making them a suitable choice of this

[05:47:07 - 05:47:12]
problem now exploration of relationship

[05:47:10 - 05:47:14]
that regression model allow us to

[05:47:12 - 05:47:17]
explore the relationship between Target

[05:47:14 - 05:47:20]
and features quantify how changes in

[05:47:17 - 05:47:22]
features like weight horsepower cylinder

[05:47:20 - 05:47:27]
affect fuel efficiency so this is the

[05:47:22 - 05:47:30]
best model to predict uh the final

[05:47:27 - 05:47:32]
outcome based on the target variable so

[05:47:30 - 05:47:35]
these all are the reasons in summary

[05:47:32 - 05:47:37]
basically why we are using agression is

[05:47:35 - 05:47:41]
for the car mpg data set

[05:47:37 - 05:47:43]
that with uh the nature of the problem

[05:47:41 - 05:47:45]
the characteristic of the data and the

[05:47:43 - 05:47:47]
goal of the analysis or prediction it

[05:47:45 - 05:47:49]
provide a statistical framework for

[05:47:47 - 05:47:51]
understanding how various features of

[05:47:49 - 05:47:53]
car influences the fuel efficiency

[05:47:51 - 05:47:57]
offering both exper insight and

[05:47:53 - 05:48:01]
predictive capability so in short we can

[05:47:57 - 05:48:04]
say that as the variable is continuous

[05:48:01 - 05:48:06]
variable so in this case we should use

[05:48:04 - 05:48:08]
the regression model that is the best

[05:48:06 - 05:48:10]
model model through which we will get

[05:48:08 - 05:48:14]
the correct prediction based on our data

[05:48:10 - 05:48:16]
set now we're going back and understand

[05:48:14 - 05:48:21]
the output which we are getting through

[05:48:16 - 05:48:23]
this prompt using the car mpg data build

[05:48:21 - 05:48:25]
a regression model building a regression

[05:48:23 - 05:48:27]
model here you can see that how many

[05:48:25 - 05:48:29]
features we have selected we'll consider

[05:48:27 - 05:48:33]
the following feature and uh these all

[05:48:29 - 05:48:35]
are the independent variables and one

[05:48:33 - 05:48:37]
would be the Target that is MPG over

[05:48:35 - 05:48:41]
here this feature include various

[05:48:37 - 05:48:43]
aspects okay and uh which influence

[05:48:41 - 05:48:45]
actually the fuel efficiency that means

[05:48:43 - 05:48:47]
the target variable these all are the

[05:48:45 - 05:48:50]
independent variables and they actually

[05:48:47 - 05:48:52]
somewhere or somehow they are

[05:48:50 - 05:48:54]
influencing the main target variable

[05:48:52 - 05:48:56]
that's why they all are comes under

[05:48:54 - 05:48:59]
independent and the target variable

[05:48:56 - 05:49:02]
would be then MPG data pre-processing

[05:48:59 - 05:49:06]
after that we're going to split the data

[05:49:02 - 05:49:08]
into features and Target means one would

[05:49:06 - 05:49:10]
be X and and the other Target would be y

[05:49:08 - 05:49:13]
we're going to split that Target

[05:49:10 - 05:49:15]
variable from the independent variables

[05:49:13 - 05:49:17]
and then further divided into training

[05:49:15 - 05:49:19]
and testing set then we're going to

[05:49:17 - 05:49:21]
build the model so we'll use a linear

[05:49:19 - 05:49:24]
regression model a common choice for

[05:49:21 - 05:49:26]
predicting a continuous outcome variable

[05:49:24 - 05:49:28]
as we have already discussed this let's

[05:49:26 - 05:49:31]
start how we're going to do that there

[05:49:28 - 05:49:34]
is a code for that there are required

[05:49:31 - 05:49:36]
libraries which you have to import first

[05:49:34 - 05:49:38]
then only you'll be able to split the

[05:49:36 - 05:49:42]
data into training and testing and you

[05:49:38 - 05:49:44]
will be able to modeling the data set so

[05:49:42 - 05:49:47]
this are complete code for that and

[05:49:44 - 05:49:49]
based on that we are getting this result

[05:49:47 - 05:49:51]
now the thing is we'll discuss this code

[05:49:49 - 05:49:53]
step by step we have imported all the

[05:49:51 - 05:49:55]
required libraries as we are using

[05:49:53 - 05:49:57]
linear regression model so we have to

[05:49:55 - 05:49:59]
import linear regression model from this

[05:49:57 - 05:50:02]
SK learn. linear model library then

[05:49:59 - 05:50:04]
after train and test split why we are

[05:50:02 - 05:50:07]
importing this because we're going to

[05:50:04 - 05:50:09]
split the data into Target and the

[05:50:07 - 05:50:11]
independent variable then after from

[05:50:09 - 05:50:15]
escalar Matrix we're going to import

[05:50:11 - 05:50:19]
mean squar error and R2 Square because

[05:50:15 - 05:50:21]
we'll check the accuracy of the uh model

[05:50:19 - 05:50:24]
so here we have splitted the data set

[05:50:21 - 05:50:26]
into X and Y X will contain all the

[05:50:24 - 05:50:29]
independent variable and Y will contain

[05:50:26 - 05:50:32]
the target variable and then we'll split

[05:50:29 - 05:50:34]
these data and after that we're going to

[05:50:32 - 05:50:36]
create and training the linear

[05:50:34 - 05:50:38]
regression model so we will apply this

[05:50:36 - 05:50:41]
linear degression function we'll store

[05:50:38 - 05:50:43]
that in the model variable and on this

[05:50:41 - 05:50:48]
model variable we're going to fit the

[05:50:43 - 05:50:52]
XTR and ytr Y TR has the target variable

[05:50:48 - 05:50:55]
value and X TR will have the independent

[05:50:52 - 05:50:58]
variable values here the vibd variable

[05:50:55 - 05:51:02]
consist the testing set on which we're

[05:50:58 - 05:51:05]
going to predict so this is all about

[05:51:02 - 05:51:08]
how to apply the code what to do uh to

[05:51:05 - 05:51:10]
get the final prediction and at last

[05:51:08 - 05:51:13]
we're going to calculate the performance

[05:51:10 - 05:51:16]
Matrix that how this model performed and

[05:51:13 - 05:51:17]
that we can understand by using MSC and

[05:51:16 - 05:51:19]
r¬≤

[05:51:17 - 05:51:22]
values and we are getting the final

[05:51:19 - 05:51:27]
output let's discuss one by one uh the

[05:51:22 - 05:51:29]
final result mean squared error is 7.25

[05:51:27 - 05:51:32]
and R square is

[05:51:29 - 05:51:34]
0.865 2 so what is the interpretation

[05:51:32 - 05:51:36]
based on this model the mean square eror

[05:51:34 - 05:51:38]
is what represent the average square

[05:51:36 - 05:51:42]
difference between the actual and the

[05:51:38 - 05:51:46]
predicted variable the trend data set X

[05:51:42 - 05:51:49]
train and Y train has actual values and

[05:51:46 - 05:51:53]
predicted values what based on test so a

[05:51:49 - 05:51:56]
lower MSC indicate a better result

[05:51:53 - 05:51:58]
better fit of the data and MSU 7.25

[05:51:56 - 05:52:01]
means that on average the model

[05:51:58 - 05:52:04]
predictions are off by the square root

[05:52:01 - 05:52:07]
of this value and approximately 2.69 MPG

[05:52:04 - 05:52:09]
R squ over here is what is a measure of

[05:52:07 - 05:52:12]
how well the model prediction match the

[05:52:09 - 05:52:14]
actual data means what actual data we

[05:52:12 - 05:52:17]
have if it is getting matched with the

[05:52:14 - 05:52:21]
prediction how well it is getting match

[05:52:17 - 05:52:25]
so is based on while we check the R squ

[05:52:21 - 05:52:29]
value here the value is 8652 that is

[05:52:25 - 05:52:31]
86.5% so that approximately is what the

[05:52:29 - 05:52:34]
variation in MPG explained by the

[05:52:31 - 05:52:36]
selected feature so this is R squ this

[05:52:34 - 05:52:38]
is MSC we have already discussed

[05:52:36 - 05:52:40]
conclusion is what the model shows a

[05:52:38 - 05:52:43]
relatively good fit to the data if you

[05:52:40 - 05:52:47]
are getting higher value of R 86% that

[05:52:43 - 05:52:50]
means your model performed well and um

[05:52:47 - 05:52:53]
feature includes what cylinder

[05:52:50 - 05:52:54]
displacement and these all are the

[05:52:53 - 05:52:56]
features based on that we were

[05:52:54 - 05:52:59]
predicting the target we already know

[05:52:56 - 05:53:00]
that is MPG the model could be further

[05:52:59 - 05:53:02]
improved and validated through

[05:53:00 - 05:53:04]
techniques such as cross validation and

[05:53:02 - 05:53:07]
all if you want to improve your model

[05:53:04 - 05:53:11]
more as of now by seeing these values R

[05:53:07 - 05:53:13]
is squ the performance Matrix we can uh

[05:53:11 - 05:53:15]
come to the conclusion that the model

[05:53:13 - 05:53:17]
shows a relatively good fit to the data

[05:53:15 - 05:53:19]
explaining a significant portion of the

[05:53:17 - 05:53:24]
variation in fuel efficiency so this is

[05:53:19 - 05:53:26]
all about the modeling of data and uh we

[05:53:24 - 05:53:29]
have discussed this part but through G

[05:53:26 - 05:53:32]
GPT we were discussing let's apply this

[05:53:29 - 05:53:34]
code in jupyter Notebook and let's see

[05:53:32 - 05:53:35]
that the output what we are getting here

[05:53:34 - 05:53:38]
is

[05:53:35 - 05:53:42]
same in jupter notebook also so when I

[05:53:38 - 05:53:44]
enter this I'm getting the same output

[05:53:42 - 05:53:47]
and this is the final output here also

[05:53:44 - 05:53:51]
you can compare right so this is all

[05:53:47 - 05:53:53]
about uh the data analysis of the car

[05:53:51 - 05:53:55]
mpg data set one more prompt I'm going

[05:53:53 - 05:53:58]
to enter

[05:53:55 - 05:54:00]
here you can see analyze the feature

[05:53:58 - 05:54:02]
importance in the degression model what

[05:54:00 - 05:54:04]
features have the most influence on fuel

[05:54:02 - 05:54:06]
efficiency and why so based on the

[05:54:04 - 05:54:10]
interpretation if you want to know that

[05:54:06 - 05:54:12]
which feature is uh having uh the

[05:54:10 - 05:54:13]
importance and uh which actually

[05:54:12 - 05:54:16]
somewhere influencing the fuel

[05:54:13 - 05:54:19]
efficiency which one is has the highest

[05:54:16 - 05:54:22]
uh value based on that uh influence so

[05:54:19 - 05:54:24]
we're going to check this by using this

[05:54:22 - 05:54:27]
prom that analyze the importance of

[05:54:24 - 05:54:29]
features and how we're going to do that

[05:54:27 - 05:54:34]
feature importance basically we

[05:54:29 - 05:54:38]
generally uh check just to understand

[05:54:34 - 05:54:41]
the prediction what we are getting there

[05:54:38 - 05:54:45]
which particular feature or which

[05:54:41 - 05:54:47]
features having more impact on the

[05:54:45 - 05:54:50]
target variable so here if you can see

[05:54:47 - 05:54:52]
the code feature importance pd. data

[05:54:50 - 05:54:55]
frame we are giving feature and

[05:54:52 - 05:54:57]
coefficient values one column would be

[05:54:55 - 05:54:59]
of feature and another would be of

[05:54:57 - 05:55:01]
coefficient these coefficient by seeing

[05:54:59 - 05:55:04]
this value we can understand okay this

[05:55:01 - 05:55:06]
feature has the highest impact and this

[05:55:04 - 05:55:10]
feature is actually influen ing our

[05:55:06 - 05:55:11]
Target variable more so out of all these

[05:55:10 - 05:55:14]
we can see that the table above shows

[05:55:11 - 05:55:16]
the coefficient of each feature in

[05:55:14 - 05:55:19]
linear regression model reflecting their

[05:55:16 - 05:55:21]
influence on fuel efficiency that is MPG

[05:55:19 - 05:55:23]
column so car type is the most

[05:55:21 - 05:55:26]
influential feature over here with a

[05:55:23 - 05:55:29]
positive coefficient 5.82 which indicate

[05:55:26 - 05:55:32]
that the car with the higher uh value

[05:55:29 - 05:55:35]
are associated with high fuel efficiency

[05:55:32 - 05:55:38]
so this value is somewhere influencing

[05:55:35 - 05:55:42]
this MPG variable more then after comes

[05:55:38 - 05:55:45]
1.49 uh coefficient that is of cylinder

[05:55:42 - 05:55:48]
and then origin and the least is weight

[05:55:45 - 05:55:51]
a small negative influence indicating

[05:55:48 - 05:55:54]
that heavy car tends to have slightly

[05:55:51 - 05:55:58]
low fuel efficiency so this has the

[05:55:54 - 05:56:01]
negative influence so why we want to

[05:55:58 - 05:56:03]
check the importance of features because

[05:56:01 - 05:56:07]
we should understand that which feature

[05:56:03 - 05:56:09]
has high impact on the target VAR

[05:56:07 - 05:56:11]
and the conclusion over here is the

[05:56:09 - 05:56:13]
feature car type cylinder origin and ear

[05:56:11 - 05:56:16]
seem to have the most significant

[05:56:13 - 05:56:17]
influence on the fuel efficiency and

[05:56:16 - 05:56:19]
based on that we can

[05:56:17 - 05:56:21]
work and the interpretation of this

[05:56:19 - 05:56:23]
coefficient should be done with caution

[05:56:21 - 05:56:25]
as the nature of the variable potential

[05:56:23 - 05:56:28]
multicity another Factor can affect the

[05:56:25 - 05:56:32]
coefficient so this is the final

[05:56:28 - 05:56:34]
analysis that features in our data set

[05:56:32 - 05:56:37]
how they are impacting the main target

[05:56:34 - 05:56:40]
variable and this is the way we can

[05:56:37 - 05:56:42]
analyze the data and the last step we're

[05:56:40 - 05:56:44]
going to perform now we're going to

[05:56:42 - 05:56:45]
apply this code also in Jupiter to check

[05:56:44 - 05:56:48]
whether we are getting the correct

[05:56:45 - 05:56:51]
output or not when I enter

[05:56:48 - 05:56:54]
this the output what we are getting here

[05:56:51 - 05:56:57]
in chat GPT we are getting here also so

[05:56:54 - 05:56:59]
that's how you can analyze your data uh

[05:56:57 - 05:57:02]
whatever you want to

[05:56:59 - 05:57:06]
analyze you can easily do that by using

[05:57:02 - 05:57:08]
chat GPT it's so easy to understand

[05:57:06 - 05:57:10]
because you are getting the codee also

[05:57:08 - 05:57:12]
and you can see that I was parall

[05:57:10 - 05:57:14]
applying the same code in Jupiter and I

[05:57:12 - 05:57:17]
was getting the correct output there

[05:57:14 - 05:57:21]
also so uh it's very easy to understand

[05:57:17 - 05:57:23]
and with that it's very um easy to get

[05:57:21 - 05:57:25]
the complete explanation also here if

[05:57:23 - 05:57:28]
suppose somewhere if you stuck that what

[05:57:25 - 05:57:30]
is the meaning of particular function or

[05:57:28 - 05:57:33]
a particular code that also you can

[05:57:30 - 05:57:36]
easily understand using chgb so it

[05:57:33 - 05:57:39]
actually make your data analysis process

[05:57:36 - 05:57:42]
easy and very understandable so that's

[05:57:39 - 05:57:45]
how we can analyze the data using chat

[05:57:42 - 05:57:48]
GPT parall you can apply this code what

[05:57:45 - 05:57:50]
you getting through jgpt in other

[05:57:48 - 05:57:51]
notebook like collab or Jupiter just to

[05:57:50 - 05:57:54]
check whether you are getting the

[05:57:51 - 05:57:57]
correct output or not and uh one thing I

[05:57:54 - 05:58:00]
can add over here is we have we should

[05:57:57 - 05:58:04]
play around with chat GPT like uh we can

[05:58:00 - 05:58:07]
explore more also here these all are the

[05:58:04 - 05:58:10]
steps of data analysis is uh using

[05:58:07 - 05:58:12]
Python and uh if you want to know more

[05:58:10 - 05:58:15]
concept based on the output what we are

[05:58:12 - 05:58:18]
getting that also you can explore by

[05:58:15 - 05:58:21]
asking or by applying or by adding

[05:58:18 - 05:58:24]
prompts in the chat gbt that makes your

[05:58:21 - 05:58:26]
data analysis Journey more easy so yeah

[05:58:24 - 05:58:30]
this is all about how to analyze the

[05:58:26 - 05:58:33]
data using python code to check GPT

[05:58:30 - 05:58:35]
thank you so now as we were continuously

[05:58:33 - 05:58:37]
discussing about uh missing values how

[05:58:35 - 05:58:40]
to missing values with median we have to

[05:58:37 - 05:58:43]
impute or we should impute with mode or

[05:58:40 - 05:58:46]
mean what is all about like mean median

[05:58:43 - 05:58:49]
mode what is uh these values are so

[05:58:46 - 05:58:52]
we'll understand this by using this

[05:58:49 - 05:58:54]
prompt we'll get to know so the prompt

[05:58:52 - 05:58:55]
which I'm going to enter over here is

[05:58:54 - 05:58:58]
display the python code for summary

[05:58:55 - 05:59:00]
statistic for the numerical variables in

[05:58:58 - 05:59:02]
the car mpg data set in a tab format

[05:59:00 - 05:59:05]
what Insight can you gain from this

[05:59:02 - 05:59:06]
statistic so let's see what is sumbody

[05:59:05 - 05:59:10]
statistic is

[05:59:06 - 05:59:10]
here as we are getting the

[05:59:13 - 05:59:20]
output so we can use describe method in

[05:59:17 - 05:59:23]
bandas to obtain summary statistic for

[05:59:20 - 05:59:26]
the numerical variable in the car mpg

[05:59:23 - 05:59:29]
data set this method will provide us

[05:59:26 - 05:59:32]
with the count mean standard deviation

[05:59:29 - 05:59:34]
minimum 25th quartile median 75th

[05:59:32 - 05:59:37]
quartile that is Q3 and maximum for each

[05:59:34 - 05:59:40]
numerical variable I know know it's bit

[05:59:37 - 05:59:43]
confusing for you but uh we'll

[05:59:40 - 05:59:46]
understand these all terms step by step

[05:59:43 - 05:59:49]
here we are getting the code to get the

[05:59:46 - 05:59:51]
summary statistic but we do not know

[05:59:49 - 05:59:54]
what is basically summary statistic is

[05:59:51 - 05:59:56]
so that we ask first to the chat GPT and

[05:59:54 - 05:59:59]
then we'll come back to this

[05:59:56 - 06:00:02]
part we are getting the complete output

[05:59:59 - 06:00:05]
based on the prompt which we entered

[06:00:02 - 06:00:07]
over there but let's understand first

[06:00:05 - 06:00:09]
what is sum statistic

[06:00:07 - 06:00:14]
is so we'll

[06:00:09 - 06:00:14]
ask J GPT that

[06:00:14 - 06:00:19]
explain

[06:00:16 - 06:00:19]
summary

[06:00:26 - 06:00:33]
statistic so now first we'll understand

[06:00:30 - 06:00:36]
all the terms what I was uh saying here

[06:00:33 - 06:00:39]
that mean median mode standard deviation

[06:00:36 - 06:00:40]
and all summary statistic we'll

[06:00:39 - 06:00:43]
understand this part and then we'll go

[06:00:40 - 06:00:47]
back to that code so here summary

[06:00:43 - 06:00:50]
statistic provide a concise description

[06:00:47 - 06:00:53]
of the main aspect of the data set

[06:00:50 - 06:00:55]
particularly for numerical variables

[06:00:53 - 06:00:57]
obviously because if you want to check

[06:00:55 - 06:00:59]
the mean of the column it should be a

[06:00:57 - 06:01:03]
numeric value then only you will get the

[06:00:59 - 06:01:05]
mean median or mode so this help in

[06:01:03 - 06:01:08]
understanding the distribution Central

[06:01:05 - 06:01:10]
tenden and dispostion of the data such a

[06:01:08 - 06:01:13]
heavy term so we'll understand this

[06:01:10 - 06:01:16]
first what is central tendency what is

[06:01:13 - 06:01:18]
dispersion of the data what next we are

[06:01:16 - 06:01:22]
getting away let's see that also first

[06:01:18 - 06:01:24]
so the commonly used summary statistics

[06:01:22 - 06:01:27]
are count which will count what the

[06:01:24 - 06:01:29]
total number of nonnull observation in

[06:01:27 - 06:01:32]
the data set it helps in understanding

[06:01:29 - 06:01:35]
the size of the data set and identifying

[06:01:32 - 06:01:36]
any missing values mean the arithmetic

[06:01:35 - 06:01:38]
average

[06:01:36 - 06:01:42]
median is the middle value that is

[06:01:38 - 06:01:45]
specify the higher half from the lower

[06:01:42 - 06:01:47]
half of the data set now the next is a

[06:01:45 - 06:01:49]
standard deviation a measure of the

[06:01:47 - 06:01:54]
dispersion or spread of the values a

[06:01:49 - 06:01:56]
high standard deviation indicate greater

[06:01:54 - 06:01:58]
variability while a low standard

[06:01:56 - 06:02:01]
deviation indicates that the value are

[06:01:58 - 06:02:04]
closer to the mean minimum the smallest

[06:02:01 - 06:02:06]
value in the data set maximum the

[06:02:04 - 06:02:09]
largest value of the data set data set

[06:02:06 - 06:02:12]
basically we'll show you like for each

[06:02:09 - 06:02:15]
column now the percentile this

[06:02:12 - 06:02:19]
percentile will divide into three parts

[06:02:15 - 06:02:23]
25th 50 and 75 50 is basically

[06:02:19 - 06:02:27]
what this one the 25th percentile that

[06:02:23 - 06:02:30]
is q1 is the value below which 25% of

[06:02:27 - 06:02:34]
the observations fall and 75th

[06:02:30 - 06:02:37]
percentile that is Q2 in which the value

[06:02:34 - 06:02:41]
below which Cent 25% of the observation

[06:02:37 - 06:02:43]
fall and in between we uh check the

[06:02:41 - 06:02:46]
median value that is

[06:02:43 - 06:02:48]
50% so now the range is the next one the

[06:02:46 - 06:02:52]
difference between the maximum and the

[06:02:48 - 06:02:55]
minimum value that is called an idea of

[06:02:52 - 06:02:58]
the spread of the data like how the data

[06:02:55 - 06:03:01]
is spread next is inter quartal range

[06:02:58 - 06:03:03]
that is IQR it is also a difference so

[06:03:01 - 06:03:07]
what is this basically the difference

[06:03:03 - 06:03:09]
between 75th and 205 percentile value

[06:03:07 - 06:03:13]
representing the range within which the

[06:03:09 - 06:03:15]
middle that is 50% of the value Falls it

[06:03:13 - 06:03:18]
is a robust measure of spread that is

[06:03:15 - 06:03:20]
nonaffected by outliers next is mode the

[06:03:18 - 06:03:24]
value that appears most frequently in

[06:03:20 - 06:03:27]
the data set this mode median we have

[06:03:24 - 06:03:30]
already studied in mathematics same

[06:03:27 - 06:03:32]
meaning is over here also next is

[06:03:30 - 06:03:34]
variance variance is the average of the

[06:03:32 - 06:03:35]
square difference from the mean it's

[06:03:34 - 06:03:38]
another measure of dispersion with the

[06:03:35 - 06:03:40]
high high value indicate greater

[06:03:38 - 06:03:42]
variability variance means what that

[06:03:40 - 06:03:48]
also you can ask if you're still

[06:03:42 - 06:03:48]
confused so you can simply just ask

[06:03:48 - 06:03:54]
explain in detail so we give over here

[06:03:52 - 06:03:59]
as a prompt that explain various in

[06:03:54 - 06:04:01]
detail when I enter this here I'll get

[06:03:59 - 06:04:04]
what Valance is a statistical measure

[06:04:01 - 06:04:06]
that describe the spread of a set of

[06:04:04 - 06:04:08]
data points within the data set that it

[06:04:06 - 06:04:11]
quantify how far individual number in

[06:04:08 - 06:04:13]
the data set are from the average and

[06:04:11 - 06:04:16]
thus provide insight into the overall

[06:04:13 - 06:04:19]
variability of the data so how we

[06:04:16 - 06:04:22]
calculate that is another thing but uh

[06:04:19 - 06:04:23]
here basically we'll get all these

[06:04:22 - 06:04:26]
values in the summary

[06:04:23 - 06:04:30]
statistic so now let's go back to the

[06:04:26 - 06:04:32]
code and here we are getting the output

[06:04:30 - 06:04:36]
we are getting the output for each

[06:04:32 - 06:04:39]
column we are getting count we getting

[06:04:36 - 06:04:40]
mean count is basically the sum okay uh

[06:04:39 - 06:04:44]
count means

[06:04:40 - 06:04:46]
total value basically here count is what

[06:04:44 - 06:04:49]
let's understand

[06:04:46 - 06:04:52]
this what CH GP is showing the total

[06:04:49 - 06:04:55]
number okay of non null observation in

[06:04:52 - 06:05:00]
the data set so now here we have count

[06:04:55 - 06:05:04]
mean standard deviation mean 25% 50% 75

[06:05:00 - 06:05:06]
that is q1 and 75 is Q3 max value

[06:05:04 - 06:05:11]
minimum value and so so on right so

[06:05:06 - 06:05:13]
let's understand uh this particular code

[06:05:11 - 06:05:15]
that whether it's giving correct output

[06:05:13 - 06:05:17]
in jupyter notebook or not when I will

[06:05:15 - 06:05:21]
enter this

[06:05:17 - 06:05:23]
here I'm getting the complete summary

[06:05:21 - 06:05:25]
this is the complete summary that is the

[06:05:23 - 06:05:28]
complete statistic of our data set which

[06:05:25 - 06:05:31]
is showing the minimum value minimum or

[06:05:28 - 06:05:33]
maximum value mean that is average

[06:05:31 - 06:05:37]
standard deviation like how the data is

[06:05:33 - 06:05:41]
deviated so these are are the statistic

[06:05:37 - 06:05:43]
next is why we always check this as you

[06:05:41 - 06:05:46]
know that we have one column over here

[06:05:43 - 06:05:48]
that is HP so when we were checking the

[06:05:46 - 06:05:51]
missing values we found that this column

[06:05:48 - 06:05:54]
has some missing values and we Cann not

[06:05:51 - 06:05:58]
remove those uh rows because uh we'll

[06:05:54 - 06:06:01]
impact the data set if we remove so what

[06:05:58 - 06:06:07]
we did there we imputed uh

[06:06:01 - 06:06:09]
with median right so by seeing this

[06:06:07 - 06:06:12]
statistic we can come to the conclusion

[06:06:09 - 06:06:16]
that like with which value we can impute

[06:06:12 - 06:06:18]
those missing values so there we imputed

[06:06:16 - 06:06:20]
the missing values with median we can

[06:06:18 - 06:06:25]
impute with average value that is mean

[06:06:20 - 06:06:28]
also or median as well now as of now we

[06:06:25 - 06:06:32]
have discussed the statistical summary

[06:06:28 - 06:06:35]
of the data set now let's understand the

[06:06:32 - 06:06:36]
next step which comes under data

[06:06:35 - 06:06:38]
analysis

[06:06:36 - 06:06:42]
so this is the summary statistic now

[06:06:38 - 06:06:45]
we'll check what output we are getting

[06:06:42 - 06:06:50]
here in terms of explanation so First

[06:06:45 - 06:06:52]
Column is MPG ranges from 9 to 46.6 MPG

[06:06:50 - 06:06:55]
the average fuel efficiency is around

[06:06:52 - 06:06:58]
this that is mean value standard

[06:06:55 - 06:07:00]
deviation is 7.8 indicating the

[06:06:58 - 06:07:03]
variability in the data set same there

[06:07:00 - 06:07:06]
might be some high fuel efficient

[06:07:03 - 06:07:08]
cars and the maximum value

[06:07:06 - 06:07:12]
of this particular column is

[06:07:08 - 06:07:14]
46.6 same we are getting the

[06:07:12 - 06:07:18]
interpretations based on the other

[06:07:14 - 06:07:21]
columns that is cylinder displacement

[06:07:18 - 06:07:24]
horsep weight acceleration

[06:07:21 - 06:07:27]
ear so now here is origin also we have

[06:07:24 - 06:07:29]
which is a very important column and we

[06:07:27 - 06:07:31]
have horsepower is also an important

[06:07:29 - 06:07:34]
column so we can see that we are getting

[06:07:31 - 06:07:38]
fair enough uh outcome based on the

[06:07:34 - 06:07:41]
prompt which we uh have given over here

[06:07:38 - 06:07:42]
for chat GPT and we are getting the

[06:07:41 - 06:07:45]
correct output as well because we have

[06:07:42 - 06:07:47]
already checked in jupyter Notebook so

[06:07:45 - 06:07:50]
let's understand the next step that

[06:07:47 - 06:07:53]
comes under data analysis thank you so

[06:07:50 - 06:07:57]
now we'll understand how all the

[06:07:53 - 06:08:01]
variables are correlated with each other

[06:07:57 - 06:08:02]
by using correlation Matrix so when I

[06:08:01 - 06:08:04]
give this prompt that create a

[06:08:02 - 06:08:07]
corelation matrix for the car mpg data

[06:08:04 - 06:08:09]
will show you the relationship between

[06:08:07 - 06:08:12]
all the variables because that also we

[06:08:09 - 06:08:15]
have to understand when we increase one

[06:08:12 - 06:08:17]
variable that what is the impact on

[06:08:15 - 06:08:19]
other variables how they all are

[06:08:17 - 06:08:21]
correlated with each other when I enter

[06:08:19 - 06:08:24]
this prompt let's see what output we are

[06:08:21 - 06:08:24]
getting

[06:08:30 - 06:08:35]
here so here first is correlation Matrix

[06:08:33 - 06:08:37]
provide a numerical summary of the

[06:08:35 - 06:08:39]
linear relationship between pair of

[06:08:37 - 06:08:42]
variables it contain correlation

[06:08:39 - 06:08:44]
coefficient that range from minus1 to 1

[06:08:42 - 06:08:46]
minus one indicating a negative linear

[06:08:44 - 06:08:49]
relationship one indicating a perfect

[06:08:46 - 06:08:53]
positive basically when uh we are

[06:08:49 - 06:08:56]
getting the graph in upward Direction

[06:08:53 - 06:08:59]
basically that means that is positive

[06:08:56 - 06:09:00]
linear relationship negative means that

[06:08:59 - 06:09:03]
because of one the other values is

[06:09:00 - 06:09:05]
getting decreased zero indicating that

[06:09:03 - 06:09:08]
there is no relationship between the

[06:09:05 - 06:09:10]
variables so when I check the code over

[06:09:08 - 06:09:12]
here to get the correlation Matrix there

[06:09:10 - 06:09:16]
is a function which we have to apply on

[06:09:12 - 06:09:19]
the data set the function name is over

[06:09:16 - 06:09:22]
here is c r that is called function

[06:09:19 - 06:09:23]
which will give you the complete summary

[06:09:22 - 06:09:27]
which will give you the complete summary

[06:09:23 - 06:09:29]
of what of how all the variables are

[06:09:27 - 06:09:31]
related with each

[06:09:29 - 06:09:33]
other and you can see that we are

[06:09:31 - 06:09:35]
getting over here the result and the

[06:09:33 - 06:09:38]
result is that

[06:09:35 - 06:09:42]
first MPG and this year these are

[06:09:38 - 06:09:45]
related with 57 negative basically like

[06:09:42 - 06:09:47]
yearly this value is getting decreased

[06:09:45 - 06:09:49]
so let's understand this complete

[06:09:47 - 06:09:53]
statistic whatever summary we are

[06:09:49 - 06:09:55]
getting here uh through chbt MPG and

[06:09:53 - 06:09:58]
engine characteristic so here you can

[06:09:55 - 06:10:01]
see this is the complete uh relationship

[06:09:58 - 06:10:03]
and uh let's understand step by step MPG

[06:10:01 - 06:10:05]
and cylinder strong negative correlation

[06:10:03 - 06:10:07]
which means that MPG and And the

[06:10:05 - 06:10:11]
cylinder variables are negatively

[06:10:07 - 06:10:14]
correlated more cylinders associate with

[06:10:11 - 06:10:16]
low fuel efficiency MPG and displacement

[06:10:14 - 06:10:19]
strong again negative correlation which

[06:10:16 - 06:10:22]
means large value of displacement leads

[06:10:19 - 06:10:24]
to lower fuel efficiency MPG and

[06:10:22 - 06:10:28]
horsepower again the strong negative

[06:10:24 - 06:10:31]
correlation which means high value of HP

[06:10:28 - 06:10:35]
column associated with the low value of

[06:10:31 - 06:10:37]
MPG that is fuel efficiency same when we

[06:10:35 - 06:10:39]
compare MPG and weight is strong

[06:10:37 - 06:10:42]
negative correlation heavy car tends to

[06:10:39 - 06:10:46]
have low fuel efficiency means the

[06:10:42 - 06:10:52]
weight of a car if it is high if it is

[06:10:46 - 06:10:54]
uh more so that will tend to low fuel

[06:10:52 - 06:10:58]
efficiency so the value of MPG will get

[06:10:54 - 06:11:01]
decrease that is why here the

[06:10:58 - 06:11:03]
correlation is strongly negative next is

[06:11:01 - 06:11:05]
cylinder displacement Horse bar and

[06:11:03 - 06:11:08]
weight

[06:11:05 - 06:11:10]
these variables are strongly positive

[06:11:08 - 06:11:11]
correlated with each other because of

[06:11:10 - 06:11:16]
one variable the other variable is

[06:11:11 - 06:11:19]
getting increased so more cylinders

[06:11:16 - 06:11:24]
typically means large displacement will

[06:11:19 - 06:11:26]
give High horsepower and greater weight

[06:11:24 - 06:11:28]
acceleration and other variables

[06:11:26 - 06:11:31]
negative correlation acceleration and

[06:11:28 - 06:11:34]
MPG has positive correlation cars with

[06:11:31 - 06:11:35]
faster acceleration tends to be more

[06:11:34 - 06:11:40]
fuel

[06:11:35 - 06:11:42]
efficient then after ER and MPG moderate

[06:11:40 - 06:11:45]
positive correlation because here you

[06:11:42 - 06:11:48]
can see the value is. 58 so these all

[06:11:45 - 06:11:52]
are text based analysis right what if we

[06:11:48 - 06:11:55]
want to see this uh through a chart like

[06:11:52 - 06:11:58]
how to visualize this correlation Matrix

[06:11:55 - 06:12:00]
through chart so let's ask the chat GPT

[06:11:58 - 06:12:03]
itself like how to visualize this

[06:12:00 - 06:12:06]
correlation Matrix and how we're going

[06:12:03 - 06:12:09]
to ask this so now if we want to

[06:12:06 - 06:12:11]
visualize this summary statistic which

[06:12:09 - 06:12:13]
is coming in the form of numbers if I

[06:12:11 - 06:12:15]
want to visualize using a chart I don't

[06:12:13 - 06:12:18]
know which chart I should use over here

[06:12:15 - 06:12:21]
to visualize the whole data so I ask CH

[06:12:18 - 06:12:23]
GP itself that visualize about output of

[06:12:21 - 06:12:26]
correlation Matrix using an appropriate

[06:12:23 - 06:12:28]
chart let's see what outcome we'll get

[06:12:26 - 06:12:28]
over

[06:12:29 - 06:12:35]
here so for visualizing the correlation

[06:12:34 - 06:12:39]
Matrix

[06:12:35 - 06:12:42]
heat map is the best chart and uh it's

[06:12:39 - 06:12:44]
the best way to visualize so here you

[06:12:42 - 06:12:47]
can see that heat map is an excellent

[06:12:44 - 06:12:50]
way to visualize correlation Matrix as

[06:12:47 - 06:12:51]
it allow us to quickly identify the

[06:12:50 - 06:12:53]
strength and the direction of the

[06:12:51 - 06:12:55]
relationship whether it is negative or

[06:12:53 - 06:12:58]
positive correlation and whether it

[06:12:55 - 06:13:01]
correlation is there or not so that we

[06:12:58 - 06:13:04]
can easily understand and stronger

[06:13:01 - 06:13:06]
correlation will have more intense color

[06:13:04 - 06:13:08]
with positive correlation typically

[06:13:06 - 06:13:11]
shown in one color example over here is

[06:13:08 - 06:13:14]
blue and negative correlation in another

[06:13:11 - 06:13:17]
so let's see what output we'll get over

[06:13:14 - 06:13:19]
here so this is the code to generate the

[06:13:17 - 06:13:22]
heat map and this is the output based on

[06:13:19 - 06:13:26]
that code so you can see

[06:13:22 - 06:13:29]
that this is the final correlation

[06:13:26 - 06:13:32]
Matrix uh using heat map the heat map

[06:13:29 - 06:13:35]
about visualizing the correlation Matrix

[06:13:32 - 06:13:38]
for the car mpg data set providing

[06:13:35 - 06:13:40]
basic understanding of the relationship

[06:13:38 - 06:13:44]
between all the variables and you can

[06:13:40 - 06:13:48]
see that if I compare this cylinder and

[06:13:44 - 06:13:51]
car type negative uh correlation if I

[06:13:48 - 06:13:54]
compare cylinder variable or let's say

[06:13:51 - 06:13:57]
MPG so if I compare MPG variable with

[06:13:54 - 06:13:59]
cylinder again it is a negative

[06:13:57 - 06:14:01]
correlation and let's see which one is

[06:13:59 - 06:14:07]
the positive

[06:14:01 - 06:14:07]
one so the positive one is

[06:14:07 - 06:14:14]
this one origin and car type it is

[06:14:10 - 06:14:17]
positively correlated and if the color

[06:14:14 - 06:14:19]
code is dark that means they are highly

[06:14:17 - 06:14:23]
correlated either negative or positive

[06:14:19 - 06:14:26]
if the color code is uh light so they

[06:14:23 - 06:14:29]
are correlated but uh not strongly

[06:14:26 - 06:14:34]
correlated so here you can see that uh

[06:14:29 - 06:14:37]
HP and this dis so here it is related uh

[06:14:34 - 06:14:39]
how it is cor corelated 09 with9 so

[06:14:37 - 06:14:42]
there is a high correlation so that's

[06:14:39 - 06:14:45]
how we can understand the correlation

[06:14:42 - 06:14:49]
Matrix we can visualize the correlation

[06:14:45 - 06:14:51]
Matrix using heat map so this is one way

[06:14:49 - 06:14:54]
to visualize correlation Matrix let's

[06:14:51 - 06:14:57]
apply this code Let's uh understand this

[06:14:54 - 06:14:59]
code when we um paste this in Jupiter

[06:14:57 - 06:15:01]
notebook and we'll see whether we'll get

[06:14:59 - 06:15:05]
an correct output or

[06:15:01 - 06:15:07]
not so when I copied this code over here

[06:15:05 - 06:15:07]
I'll

[06:15:07 - 06:15:14]
enter and let's see whether we getting

[06:15:10 - 06:15:17]
the output okay we getting an

[06:15:14 - 06:15:20]
error Matrix okay so here uh it's

[06:15:17 - 06:15:22]
showing an error why because we are

[06:15:20 - 06:15:25]
calling here directly the variable

[06:15:22 - 06:15:27]
correlation Matrix U we are giving as a

[06:15:25 - 06:15:30]
variable over here based on which

[06:15:27 - 06:15:31]
variable you want to display the heat

[06:15:30 - 06:15:35]
map and I'm giving here correlation

[06:15:31 - 06:15:38]
Matrix correlation Matrix uh computer

[06:15:35 - 06:15:40]
here the notebook is not uh getting any

[06:15:38 - 06:15:43]
variable uh with the name correlation

[06:15:40 - 06:15:47]
Matrix so first we have to

[06:15:43 - 06:15:50]
check the previous code here you can see

[06:15:47 - 06:15:53]
that we have stored all that

[06:15:50 - 06:15:56]
correlation um sumary that is statistic

[06:15:53 - 06:15:58]
in this variable which you are not

[06:15:56 - 06:16:00]
defining in the notebook so obviously we

[06:15:58 - 06:16:02]
will not get an output so first I will

[06:16:00 - 06:16:07]
copy this code when I'll copy and paste

[06:16:02 - 06:16:07]
over here then we'll sure get an

[06:16:08 - 06:16:15]
output let's

[06:16:11 - 06:16:19]
see so here first by using this uh

[06:16:15 - 06:16:22]
correlation function that is c r we'll

[06:16:19 - 06:16:25]
store the complete statistic correlation

[06:16:22 - 06:16:26]
Matrix in this variable and when we call

[06:16:25 - 06:16:29]
this

[06:16:26 - 06:16:32]
variable in heat

[06:16:29 - 06:16:35]
map so we'll get

[06:16:32 - 06:16:39]
the complete chart based on the

[06:16:35 - 06:16:40]
correlation Matrix of our data set so

[06:16:39 - 06:16:42]
this is the complete output what we are

[06:16:40 - 06:16:44]
getting over here that means the code

[06:16:42 - 06:16:46]
what CH GPT is generating is giving a

[06:16:44 - 06:16:51]
correct

[06:16:46 - 06:16:54]
output now the next step is to perform

[06:16:51 - 06:16:57]
the univariate analysis here we have

[06:16:54 - 06:16:59]
seen that how all the variables are

[06:16:57 - 06:17:01]
correlated how they are related with

[06:16:59 - 06:17:05]
each other is there any relationship if

[06:17:01 - 06:17:06]
it is there then how the relationship is

[06:17:05 - 06:17:08]
and what type of relationship negative

[06:17:06 - 06:17:11]
or positive so that we have already

[06:17:08 - 06:17:14]
discussed next is to understand the

[06:17:11 - 06:17:16]
analysis between all the variables

[06:17:14 - 06:17:18]
univariate analysis and byari Analysis

[06:17:16 - 06:17:21]
we're going to understand first we'll

[06:17:18 - 06:17:23]
cover the univariate analysis now the

[06:17:21 - 06:17:25]
next prompt over here is what is

[06:17:23 - 06:17:26]
univarate analysis first you'll

[06:17:25 - 06:17:29]
understand what is basically univarate

[06:17:26 - 06:17:31]
analysis like I know what is univariate

[06:17:29 - 06:17:33]
but um if a learner is analyzing a data

[06:17:31 - 06:17:36]
set for the first time the person should

[06:17:33 - 06:17:39]
know what is unival analysis so first

[06:17:36 - 06:17:42]
I'll ask chat GPT that what is unival

[06:17:39 - 06:17:45]
analysis and then provide for the about

[06:17:42 - 06:17:47]
data set that analysis and visualize

[06:17:45 - 06:17:53]
using appropriate chart let's enter this

[06:17:47 - 06:17:53]
prompt and understand the

[06:17:54 - 06:18:00]
output okay so univarate analysis is

[06:17:57 - 06:18:02]
basically what uni means one so is a

[06:18:00 - 06:18:05]
type of statistical analysis focus on

[06:18:02 - 06:18:09]
single variable

[06:18:05 - 06:18:12]
so if you want to analyze all the

[06:18:09 - 06:18:15]
variables that uh is comes under

[06:18:12 - 06:18:17]
univariate if you want to understand the

[06:18:15 - 06:18:19]
relationship between two variables

[06:18:17 - 06:18:21]
together that comes under by variate by

[06:18:19 - 06:18:24]
means two univariate basically if you

[06:18:21 - 06:18:27]
want to understand uh or if you want to

[06:18:24 - 06:18:31]
visualize a single variable so we'll use

[06:18:27 - 06:18:34]
various plots for that and here you can

[06:18:31 - 06:18:35]
see for this data set or for any other

[06:18:34 - 06:18:38]
data set also

[06:18:35 - 06:18:40]
we can conduct univariate analysis first

[06:18:38 - 06:18:44]
should be on numerical variable and

[06:18:40 - 06:18:47]
visualize that using histogram box plot

[06:18:44 - 06:18:49]
or density plot histogram provide

[06:18:47 - 06:18:51]
frequency distribution of the data how

[06:18:49 - 06:18:53]
the data is distributed frequent like in

[06:18:51 - 06:18:56]
terms of frequency we're going to

[06:18:53 - 06:19:00]
visualize showing the shape how the data

[06:18:56 - 06:19:03]
is spread and the central tendency next

[06:19:00 - 06:19:05]
is box plot which will offer a visual

[06:19:03 - 06:19:09]
summary of the central tendency that how

[06:19:05 - 06:19:12]
the the data is spread whether it is

[06:19:09 - 06:19:16]
normally distributed or it is left

[06:19:12 - 06:19:18]
skewed or I so that I'll discuss and as

[06:19:16 - 06:19:20]
well as the potential outlier whether do

[06:19:18 - 06:19:22]
we have an outlier in the variable or

[06:19:20 - 06:19:25]
not that also we can understand using

[06:19:22 - 06:19:29]
box plot the density plot is is another

[06:19:25 - 06:19:31]
way to perform Univar analysis so let's

[06:19:29 - 06:19:31]
see

[06:19:32 - 06:19:37]
here this is the complete code based on

[06:19:35 - 06:19:39]
that we'll get an output univarate

[06:19:37 - 06:19:41]
analysis of all the

[06:19:39 - 06:19:45]
variables so here we are getting

[06:19:41 - 06:19:47]
histogram we are visualizing the data we

[06:19:45 - 06:19:51]
are visualizing the variables using

[06:19:47 - 06:19:54]
histogram so if I will see this code you

[06:19:51 - 06:19:57]
can see here that the code is showing

[06:19:54 - 06:19:59]
this out the numerical variables because

[06:19:57 - 06:20:00]
if you want to analyze the variable

[06:19:59 - 06:20:02]
first you have to check how many

[06:20:00 - 06:20:05]
numerical variables do we have in the

[06:20:02 - 06:20:09]
data set we list out and uh based on

[06:20:05 - 06:20:13]
that we going to use over here um for

[06:20:09 - 06:20:16]
Loop and that Loop will actually um

[06:20:13 - 06:20:18]
repeat this code again and again to get

[06:20:16 - 06:20:20]
the final output which should be based

[06:20:18 - 06:20:22]
on histogram because here what we are

[06:20:20 - 06:20:24]
giving that looping through the

[06:20:22 - 06:20:27]
numerical variables to create histogram

[06:20:24 - 06:20:29]
box plot and density plot so basically

[06:20:27 - 06:20:32]
we are going to visualize through all

[06:20:29 - 06:20:36]
these FL plots this is the complete code

[06:20:32 - 06:20:40]
for that let's see the output

[06:20:36 - 06:20:44]
this is a histogram showing you uh the

[06:20:40 - 06:20:46]
values are normally distributed or not

[06:20:44 - 06:20:50]
so let's see the explanation based on

[06:20:46 - 06:20:53]
this uh charts first is let's discuss

[06:20:50 - 06:20:55]
about MPG miles per gallon appears to

[06:20:53 - 06:20:58]
have a right isbe distribution with most

[06:20:55 - 06:21:04]
cars having fuel efficiency around 15 to

[06:20:58 - 06:21:07]
25 MPG so let's go to this histogram so

[06:21:04 - 06:21:09]
here you can see that it is right skewed

[06:21:07 - 06:21:12]
the tail is going towards right so

[06:21:09 - 06:21:14]
that's why the name is Right skewed and

[06:21:12 - 06:21:17]
most of the distribution is towards

[06:21:14 - 06:21:21]
right and with most cars having the fuel

[06:21:17 - 06:21:25]
efficiency how much between 20 to 25

[06:21:21 - 06:21:29]
from here so from 25 so most of between

[06:21:25 - 06:21:33]
20 25 few having fuel efficiency 45 also

[06:21:29 - 06:21:36]
few having 10 also but most of the fuel

[06:21:33 - 06:21:39]
efficiency of the car is comes under 20

[06:21:36 - 06:21:42]
to 25 next is same for

[06:21:39 - 06:21:44]
cylinder displacement let's discuss

[06:21:42 - 06:21:45]
about this origin this is a categorical

[06:21:44 - 06:21:48]
variable showing the distribution of

[06:21:45 - 06:21:49]
cars across different origin car type

[06:21:48 - 06:21:51]
binary variable showing the distribution

[06:21:49 - 06:21:53]
of two different car categories now

[06:21:51 - 06:21:56]
let's discuss one more variable over

[06:21:53 - 06:21:58]
here to understand this histogram and

[06:21:56 - 06:22:01]
write is skute okay let's discuss about

[06:21:58 - 06:22:03]
horsepower so right is skew distribution

[06:22:01 - 06:22:05]
indicating that most car have horsepower

[06:22:03 - 06:22:11]
in the lower range so where is that Hors

[06:22:05 - 06:22:13]
power variable that is HP here so you

[06:22:11 - 06:22:16]
can see the tail over here it is right

[06:22:13 - 06:22:20]
is skewed and uh they are here it's

[06:22:16 - 06:22:22]
showing that uh that most here most uh

[06:22:20 - 06:22:24]
values comes

[06:22:22 - 06:22:28]
under in lower range lower range

[06:22:24 - 06:22:32]
basically 52 75 and this is the lower

[06:22:28 - 06:22:35]
range because here values are very less

[06:22:32 - 06:22:39]
but this is right is cu so yeah this is

[06:22:35 - 06:22:41]
the way to visualize the data set using

[06:22:39 - 06:22:43]
histogram this visualization provide the

[06:22:41 - 06:22:45]
valuable Insite into the individual

[06:22:43 - 06:22:48]
characteristic of the variable such as

[06:22:45 - 06:22:51]
the shape of the distribution uh whether

[06:22:48 - 06:22:53]
the values are normally distributed or

[06:22:51 - 06:22:56]
not so now next is we're going to

[06:22:53 - 06:22:58]
visualize the data set using box blot as

[06:22:56 - 06:23:02]
well as we have already visualized using

[06:22:58 - 06:23:05]
histogram second will be U box plot so

[06:23:02 - 06:23:08]
here why we are using box to understand

[06:23:05 - 06:23:12]
whether we have any outliers in the data

[06:23:08 - 06:23:14]
set or not so for that I have given the

[06:23:12 - 06:23:16]
prompt that visualized about data set

[06:23:14 - 06:23:18]
using box plot and based on that we are

[06:23:16 - 06:23:21]
getting this output that box plot also

[06:23:18 - 06:23:23]
known as box and viscal plot is an

[06:23:21 - 06:23:25]
excellent way actually to visualize the

[06:23:23 - 06:23:26]
distribution of numerical variable as

[06:23:25 - 06:23:29]
they provide information about central

[06:23:26 - 06:23:32]
tendency spread and potential outliers

[06:23:29 - 06:23:34]
so you can see here this is the code

[06:23:32 - 06:23:37]
relevant code and based on that we are

[06:23:34 - 06:23:39]
getting getting the output so few of the

[06:23:37 - 06:23:43]
variables have some outlines you can see

[06:23:39 - 06:23:45]
here these uh dots right these all are

[06:23:43 - 06:23:47]
what outliers values which are

[06:23:45 - 06:23:50]
completely different not different but

[06:23:47 - 06:23:53]
uh uh if we see that is completely outly

[06:23:50 - 06:23:57]
from the main values I already explained

[06:23:53 - 06:24:00]
like how uh different or from the main

[06:23:57 - 06:24:06]
values like if we give in a column six

[06:24:00 - 06:24:08]
values like 2 4 6 10 and the last value

[06:24:06 - 06:24:12]
would be for an example 100 so that 100

[06:24:08 - 06:24:14]
comes under outliers okay so breaking

[06:24:12 - 06:24:17]
that sequence right so here all values

[06:24:14 - 06:24:21]
are very nearby like 2 4 6 8 but that

[06:24:17 - 06:24:23]
100 is completely um very far from that

[06:24:21 - 06:24:26]
sequence of that Series so that is the

[06:24:23 - 06:24:31]
part of outly here we can see that uh

[06:24:26 - 06:24:35]
this HP column has outliers and uh

[06:24:31 - 06:24:39]
acceleration uh this column also has

[06:24:35 - 06:24:41]
outliers so let's see the final result

[06:24:39 - 06:24:44]
the summary of this the mpg miles per

[06:24:41 - 06:24:45]
gallon displays a right skew

[06:24:44 - 06:24:47]
distribution with some potential

[06:24:45 - 06:24:52]
outliers on the higher end higher end

[06:24:47 - 06:24:55]
means here after 50% basically in the in

[06:24:52 - 06:24:58]
the portion of 75th quartile so now the

[06:24:55 - 06:24:59]
next is cylinder shows distinct

[06:24:58 - 06:25:03]
categories reflecting the specific

[06:24:59 - 06:25:05]
engine configuration we were discussing

[06:25:03 - 06:25:07]
uh in the Box FL about HP right reveals

[06:25:05 - 06:25:09]
a right is cued distribution with few

[06:25:07 - 06:25:13]
outliers on the higher end so higher end

[06:25:09 - 06:25:16]
lower end is what 25th quartile is lower

[06:25:13 - 06:25:21]
and the 75th per that is

[06:25:16 - 06:25:23]
75% that Q3 is the higher end so in

[06:25:21 - 06:25:27]
higher end we have outliers here also

[06:25:23 - 06:25:29]
here we have in lower end as well so

[06:25:27 - 06:25:32]
this is the Box lot through which we can

[06:25:29 - 06:25:34]
understand which variables have outliers

[06:25:32 - 06:25:36]
and if we have more outlier so we have

[06:25:34 - 06:25:39]
to work on that as well so this is all

[06:25:36 - 06:25:41]
about uh to visualize the variables

[06:25:39 - 06:25:45]
using box plot and it also comes under

[06:25:41 - 06:25:48]
Univar analysis so this is the box plot

[06:25:45 - 06:25:51]
we have already discussed now let's

[06:25:48 - 06:25:53]
apply this code of this box plot and the

[06:25:51 - 06:25:55]
histogram and let's see whether we are

[06:25:53 - 06:25:59]
getting the output in jupyter nput so

[06:25:55 - 06:26:03]
when I copied code from here let's paste

[06:25:59 - 06:26:05]
over here and run the

[06:26:03 - 06:26:07]
code are we getting the output yes we

[06:26:05 - 06:26:09]
are getting all the histogram based on

[06:26:07 - 06:26:13]
all the variables here we already

[06:26:09 - 06:26:16]
discussed and next let's apply the code

[06:26:13 - 06:26:20]
to generate uh box plot so simply we

[06:26:16 - 06:26:24]
have to copy the code and we have to

[06:26:20 - 06:26:26]
paste in jupyter Notebook so here we are

[06:26:24 - 06:26:28]
getting the complete box blot and you

[06:26:26 - 06:26:30]
can see these all are the outliers

[06:26:28 - 06:26:33]
outliers to the higher end here also we

[06:26:30 - 06:26:37]
have outliers in this variable so this

[06:26:33 - 06:26:40]
is the Box block L now we will going to

[06:26:37 - 06:26:44]
understand about by variate analysis and

[06:26:40 - 06:26:47]
U we're going to use a prompt to

[06:26:44 - 06:26:50]
generate a byar analysis part like how

[06:26:47 - 06:26:53]
to visualize the relationship between

[06:26:50 - 06:26:56]
two variables using various plots we're

[06:26:53 - 06:26:58]
going to understand that so till now we

[06:26:56 - 06:27:01]
have understood how to analyze data

[06:26:58 - 06:27:02]
using python code through chat jpt now

[06:27:01 - 06:27:05]
we're going to understand data analysis

[06:27:02 - 06:27:07]
using Excel command through

[06:27:05 - 06:27:09]
so first we need to understand what are

[06:27:07 - 06:27:12]
the various steps to perform the data

[06:27:09 - 06:27:13]
analysis using Exel so when I enter this

[06:27:12 - 06:27:16]
prompt over

[06:27:13 - 06:27:19]
here I'm getting uh the explanation

[06:27:16 - 06:27:21]
based on that means I'll get various

[06:27:19 - 06:27:25]
steps that needs to be covered during

[06:27:21 - 06:27:28]
analysis uh by using Exel so collect

[06:27:25 - 06:27:31]
data import data so how will collect

[06:27:28 - 06:27:33]
data we will collect data in the form of

[06:27:31 - 06:27:36]
Excel sheet we're going to import that

[06:27:33 - 06:27:38]
uh first you have to open Excel then we

[06:27:36 - 06:27:42]
have to copy paste or we can directly

[06:27:38 - 06:27:45]
open the file Excel file CSV format and

[06:27:42 - 06:27:47]
uh we'll use that complete data set

[06:27:45 - 06:27:49]
forther analysis next step is cleaning

[06:27:47 - 06:27:52]
and pre-processing handle missing value

[06:27:49 - 06:27:55]
if we have data formatting and

[06:27:52 - 06:27:58]
formatting means format cells properly

[06:27:55 - 06:28:00]
to ensure consistency remove duplicates

[06:27:58 - 06:28:02]
we have already discussed this part when

[06:28:00 - 06:28:04]
we were discussing using python code

[06:28:02 - 06:28:07]
remove duplicates is actually very

[06:28:04 - 06:28:11]
important part convert text to

[06:28:07 - 06:28:14]
columns if needed so it is just if you

[06:28:11 - 06:28:17]
need uh to convert the transformation if

[06:28:14 - 06:28:21]
it is required there so there we have to

[06:28:17 - 06:28:23]
convert the text to colum now data

[06:28:21 - 06:28:26]
exploration and summarization sort and

[06:28:23 - 06:28:29]
filter using sort and filter to explor

[06:28:26 - 06:28:32]
specific segments of data P table to

[06:28:29 - 06:28:34]
create uh P table why to summarize and

[06:28:32 - 06:28:36]
aggregate data across different d

[06:28:34 - 06:28:38]
Dimensions calculate descriptive

[06:28:36 - 06:28:40]
statistic statistic we have already

[06:28:38 - 06:28:42]
discussed like if you want to know the

[06:28:40 - 06:28:45]
average median and standard deviation

[06:28:42 - 06:28:47]
Etc to calculate the summary statistic

[06:28:45 - 06:28:49]
there visualization using different

[06:28:47 - 06:28:52]
different charts we can do that and

[06:28:49 - 06:28:54]
Analysis and modeling so apply formulas

[06:28:52 - 06:28:57]
and function for that we're going to do

[06:28:54 - 06:28:59]
that then after analysis and modeling

[06:28:57 - 06:29:01]
and interpretation and inside generation

[06:28:59 - 06:29:04]
today we're going to analyze the data

[06:29:01 - 06:29:06]
using Excel let's understand data

[06:29:04 - 06:29:08]
analysis using Excel command step by

[06:29:06 - 06:29:11]
step so these all are the steps which we

[06:29:08 - 06:29:13]
have already covered when we were

[06:29:11 - 06:29:17]
discussing the data analysis using

[06:29:13 - 06:29:19]
python code so the first U prompt for

[06:29:17 - 06:29:21]
analyzing the data using Excel command

[06:29:19 - 06:29:24]
is write the Excel command for the above

[06:29:21 - 06:29:26]
data set we have already uh loaded the

[06:29:24 - 06:29:28]
data so write the Excel command for the

[06:29:26 - 06:29:31]
above data set to check the data types

[06:29:28 - 06:29:33]
because obviously if it is the starting

[06:29:31 - 06:29:36]
process of data analysis we have to

[06:29:33 - 06:29:38]
check the data types of the data which

[06:29:36 - 06:29:40]
we're going to use for further analysis

[06:29:38 - 06:29:44]
when I enter

[06:29:40 - 06:29:46]
this let's see what explanation here

[06:29:44 - 06:29:50]
what output we are getting so in Excel

[06:29:46 - 06:29:53]
you cannot directly check the data type

[06:29:50 - 06:29:56]
we have to apply um some formula to

[06:29:53 - 06:29:58]
check that so we have to select the cell

[06:29:56 - 06:30:01]
for which you want to check the data

[06:29:58 - 06:30:04]
type so however you can use various

[06:30:01 - 06:30:06]
methods which method let's discuss that

[06:30:04 - 06:30:07]
use the number format drop down menu

[06:30:06 - 06:30:09]
select the cell or column you want to

[06:30:07 - 06:30:12]
inspect look at the number format drop

[06:30:09 - 06:30:15]
down menu on the Home tab select format

[06:30:12 - 06:30:17]
use Excel function and in for data types

[06:30:15 - 06:30:20]
so we're going to use this

[06:30:17 - 06:30:23]
formula how we're going to use we are

[06:30:20 - 06:30:26]
going to understand which data type uh

[06:30:23 - 06:30:30]
we uh want to check suppose if you want

[06:30:26 - 06:30:32]
to check the column has uh numeric value

[06:30:30 - 06:30:36]
or if the column is having text value or

[06:30:32 - 06:30:38]
the column has date type of values so

[06:30:36 - 06:30:41]
for that we have three functions so

[06:30:38 - 06:30:46]
through that we can uh check if the

[06:30:41 - 06:30:48]
value is uh numeric then uh what we get

[06:30:46 - 06:30:50]
Let's see we going to apply the same

[06:30:48 - 06:30:53]
function we going to apply the same

[06:30:50 - 06:30:55]
formula there in Excel one more way is

[06:30:53 - 06:30:58]
inspect cell format manually right click

[06:30:55 - 06:31:00]
on the cell or column select format cell

[06:30:58 - 06:31:03]
and look at the number type so that's

[06:31:00 - 06:31:06]
how also you can do power query one more

[06:31:03 - 06:31:08]
is there we're going to apply this

[06:31:06 - 06:31:11]
formula let's apply

[06:31:08 - 06:31:13]
this here A1 is what with the reference

[06:31:11 - 06:31:15]
to the cell you want to check so I want

[06:31:13 - 06:31:17]
to check whether the column has numeric

[06:31:15 - 06:31:19]
value or not if it is not numeric then

[06:31:17 - 06:31:23]
what output we'll get there so I'll go

[06:31:19 - 06:31:26]
to that Excel sheet I'll apply

[06:31:23 - 06:31:26]
here this

[06:31:29 - 06:31:36]
formula so I'll change this

[06:31:32 - 06:31:37]
value I want to check for which

[06:31:36 - 06:31:41]
column this

[06:31:37 - 06:31:44]
one let's check the till 399 we have the

[06:31:41 - 06:31:44]
values

[06:31:50 - 06:31:56]
here so when I select the range over

[06:31:56 - 06:32:01]
here let's see you can see that from A2

[06:32:01 - 06:32:06]
that

[06:32:01 - 06:32:10]
means column a row number 2 till a399

[06:32:06 - 06:32:13]
column A till 399th row so when I am

[06:32:10 - 06:32:17]
applying this range I will check whether

[06:32:13 - 06:32:21]
from column A to uh

[06:32:17 - 06:32:26]
a399 is number or is not a number or is

[06:32:21 - 06:32:26]
not a numeric value so when I enter

[06:32:26 - 06:32:31]
this so it's showing here true so when I

[06:32:29 - 06:32:34]
enter after giving the range in that

[06:32:31 - 06:32:37]
formula I'm getting true that means the

[06:32:34 - 06:32:40]
values which comes under First Column

[06:32:37 - 06:32:43]
that is MPG is numeric value okay that's

[06:32:40 - 06:32:45]
how you can check the data type if you

[06:32:43 - 06:32:48]
want to check for other uh column you

[06:32:45 - 06:32:50]
just have to select the range from where

[06:32:48 - 06:32:53]
to where you want to check the data type

[06:32:50 - 06:32:55]
so that's how you can check other

[06:32:53 - 06:32:58]
processes are there other process means

[06:32:55 - 06:33:01]
other ways are there to check the data

[06:32:58 - 06:33:04]
type I want you to explore these uh

[06:33:01 - 06:33:07]
steps I have applied one way you can

[06:33:04 - 06:33:11]
apply other ways as well to get the data

[06:33:07 - 06:33:14]
type of each column now the next prompt

[06:33:11 - 06:33:16]
what will going to apply here is write

[06:33:14 - 06:33:19]
the Excel command to check the missing

[06:33:16 - 06:33:21]
values for the above data set so this is

[06:33:19 - 06:33:23]
the next prompt and based on that we're

[06:33:21 - 06:33:25]
going to understand whether do we have

[06:33:23 - 06:33:29]
missing values or not so when I enter

[06:33:25 - 06:33:32]
this prompt I will get the required

[06:33:29 - 06:33:34]
formula and uh based on that we can

[06:33:32 - 06:33:36]
check whether do we have missing values

[06:33:34 - 06:33:38]
in our columns if we have missing value

[06:33:36 - 06:33:42]
then we'll impute those values or we can

[06:33:38 - 06:33:45]
remove based on the data set so here we

[06:33:42 - 06:33:48]
have a lot of uh ways so first is we can

[06:33:45 - 06:33:51]
check by using is blank function next is

[06:33:48 - 06:33:54]
conditional formatting Third Way is

[06:33:51 - 06:33:57]
using filter to identify Blank cell but

[06:33:54 - 06:33:59]
sometime the cell will not remain blank

[06:33:57 - 06:34:01]
some values would be there but uh they

[06:33:59 - 06:34:04]
could be like unknown or some missing

[06:34:01 - 06:34:07]
value like question mark right so that

[06:34:04 - 06:34:10]
is not a blank cell value is there so

[06:34:07 - 06:34:12]
this process will not be so helpful to

[06:34:10 - 06:34:15]
find out the missing value using a p

[06:34:12 - 06:34:17]
table to summarize missing values using

[06:34:15 - 06:34:21]
the IF function with is blank for custom

[06:34:17 - 06:34:23]
messages so let's apply the first one

[06:34:21 - 06:34:26]
okay so this formula when I apply let's

[06:34:23 - 06:34:27]
select this from here let's go to that

[06:34:26 - 06:34:31]
Excel

[06:34:27 - 06:34:34]
sheet apply here this formula so as I

[06:34:31 - 06:34:38]
have applied over here uh the formula is

[06:34:34 - 06:34:43]
blank and uh I'm selecting some rows

[06:34:38 - 06:34:45]
from the First Column A3 to a25 I'm

[06:34:43 - 06:34:49]
selecting as of now you can see that A3

[06:34:45 - 06:34:51]
to a25 when I enter I'm getting false so

[06:34:49 - 06:34:54]
basically false is showing over here

[06:34:51 - 06:34:57]
that we do not have any blank cell over

[06:34:54 - 06:35:00]
here right what if we have missing value

[06:34:57 - 06:35:03]
in terms of question mark that question

[06:35:00 - 06:35:05]
mark will comes under what um the

[06:35:03 - 06:35:09]
unknown value okay which is uh not

[06:35:05 - 06:35:11]
giving any Worth to the required column

[06:35:09 - 06:35:14]
so that also comes under missing value

[06:35:11 - 06:35:16]
so there we uh cannot get the exact

[06:35:14 - 06:35:18]
output through this particular formula

[06:35:16 - 06:35:22]
so what we can do in that

[06:35:18 - 06:35:26]
case what I will do here we can apply

[06:35:22 - 06:35:30]
one more way to do that is conditional

[06:35:26 - 06:35:33]
formatting one more is using filter so

[06:35:30 - 06:35:37]
that filter uh we can apply in the the

[06:35:33 - 06:35:38]
Excel sheet for each column suppose if I

[06:35:37 - 06:35:42]
want to check

[06:35:38 - 06:35:44]
in this column okay I want to apply the

[06:35:42 - 06:35:46]
filter where I will

[06:35:44 - 06:35:50]
go I'll go to

[06:35:46 - 06:35:53]
this data here I'm getting this filter

[06:35:50 - 06:35:55]
option I'll apply filter because as I've

[06:35:53 - 06:35:57]
selected one column over here so on that

[06:35:55 - 06:36:00]
I'm getting this filter option whenever

[06:35:57 - 06:36:04]
will click on this Arrow I'm getting all

[06:36:00 - 06:36:08]
the unique values okay here you can see

[06:36:04 - 06:36:10]
one value is question mark right so this

[06:36:08 - 06:36:12]
value is completely unknown to us right

[06:36:10 - 06:36:14]
all values are numeric except this

[06:36:12 - 06:36:17]
question mark and question mark is uh

[06:36:14 - 06:36:19]
comes under missing value only so what

[06:36:17 - 06:36:22]
we can do we will filter out this value

[06:36:19 - 06:36:25]
like how many rows do we have in our

[06:36:22 - 06:36:28]
data set with this type of character so

[06:36:25 - 06:36:32]
I will select what first I'll dis select

[06:36:28 - 06:36:35]
all the values and I'll select only this

[06:36:32 - 06:36:35]
one

[06:36:35 - 06:36:45]
and click on okay so out of 399 rows we

[06:36:41 - 06:36:47]
have one 2 3 4 5 we have how many rows

[06:36:45 - 06:36:51]
here you can see

[06:36:47 - 06:36:53]
six rows okay that has this question

[06:36:51 - 06:36:56]
mark character basically these all are

[06:36:53 - 06:36:59]
missing values only so we have to impute

[06:36:56 - 06:37:01]
this missing value how we can do that so

[06:36:59 - 06:37:04]
we can do that by imputing these

[06:37:01 - 06:37:07]
question mark with

[06:37:04 - 06:37:10]
median average or mode of this

[06:37:07 - 06:37:14]
particular column so for that what I can

[06:37:10 - 06:37:17]
do I can suggest you one more uh way

[06:37:14 - 06:37:20]
first we need to understand why we are

[06:37:17 - 06:37:24]
imputing with average mean or median so

[06:37:20 - 06:37:26]
here if the value is giving an

[06:37:24 - 06:37:28]
importance and if you remove that

[06:37:26 - 06:37:31]
missing value will not impact the data

[06:37:28 - 06:37:33]
set then we can remove directly that row

[06:37:31 - 06:37:36]
but if the values what we have in the

[06:37:33 - 06:37:38]
data data set somewhere it giving the

[06:37:36 - 06:37:40]
importance okay somewhere it is actually

[06:37:38 - 06:37:42]
impacting the data set so there we

[06:37:40 - 06:37:44]
should impute those missing values with

[06:37:42 - 06:37:46]
average mean and mode that we have

[06:37:44 - 06:37:49]
already discussed when uh while

[06:37:46 - 06:37:52]
discussing the data analysis using

[06:37:49 - 06:37:56]
python so here we need to import those

[06:37:52 - 06:37:59]
six rows with that question uh character

[06:37:56 - 06:38:02]
uh with medium average and mode value if

[06:37:59 - 06:38:05]
you want to check the average value

[06:38:02 - 06:38:08]
let's impute here with mean so what I

[06:38:05 - 06:38:10]
can do here I will select this column

[06:38:08 - 06:38:13]
you can see here sum we are getting

[06:38:10 - 06:38:15]
average we are getting 104 right so the

[06:38:13 - 06:38:19]
average value of this particular column

[06:38:15 - 06:38:22]
if I select this whole

[06:38:19 - 06:38:25]
column here also I'm getting the average

[06:38:22 - 06:38:29]
value 104.4 69 or one more way is there

[06:38:25 - 06:38:33]
we can apply what the formula equal to

[06:38:29 - 06:38:36]
average formula uh we can apply where

[06:38:33 - 06:38:38]
just just select a cell here if I select

[06:38:36 - 06:38:38]
equal

[06:38:40 - 06:38:47]
to average or we can select median also

[06:38:44 - 06:38:47]
so if I select

[06:38:48 - 06:38:53]
median medion of what so we have to give

[06:38:51 - 06:38:57]
the range over here so I'll select the

[06:38:53 - 06:39:03]
range from where from here to till 399

[06:38:57 - 06:39:05]
so the column is D from D2 till d399 so

[06:39:03 - 06:39:08]
d to

[06:39:05 - 06:39:11]
column

[06:39:08 - 06:39:16]
d399 I want the median value when I

[06:39:11 - 06:39:18]
enter I'm getting 93.5 so we can imput

[06:39:16 - 06:39:21]
those missing values with this median

[06:39:18 - 06:39:24]
value okay how to impute now so I will

[06:39:21 - 06:39:27]
select this First Column okay but let's

[06:39:24 - 06:39:30]
discuss this first with chat gbt how to

[06:39:27 - 06:39:34]
impute missing values so when I go back

[06:39:30 - 06:39:36]
to the chat GPT here I'm getting like

[06:39:34 - 06:39:38]
how to get the missing value now we'll

[06:39:36 - 06:39:40]
understand how to impute the missing

[06:39:38 - 06:39:43]
values if we have in the data set so

[06:39:40 - 06:39:46]
when I enter this we will get some

[06:39:43 - 06:39:47]
suggestions from uh chat GPT so through

[06:39:46 - 06:39:50]
chat GPT I'm getting here some

[06:39:47 - 06:39:52]
suggestions that here's our common

[06:39:50 - 06:39:54]
approach which we can use calculate the

[06:39:52 - 06:39:58]
mean of the column we have already

[06:39:54 - 06:40:00]
calculated mean we will impute the value

[06:39:58 - 06:40:03]
not by using mean we will impute with

[06:40:00 - 06:40:06]
median so instead of applying average

[06:40:03 - 06:40:09]
function we can apply median function

[06:40:06 - 06:40:11]
there and then after we can replace the

[06:40:09 - 06:40:14]
original column with the imputed how we

[06:40:11 - 06:40:17]
can do that these all are the different

[06:40:14 - 06:40:19]
ways to impute the values if you want to

[06:40:17 - 06:40:21]
replace the original value in column

[06:40:19 - 06:40:23]
with the inputed value you can just copy

[06:40:21 - 06:40:26]
column C and paste it as values on into

[06:40:23 - 06:40:29]
column A control+ C select column right

[06:40:26 - 06:40:30]
click and choose paste spal and value so

[06:40:29 - 06:40:32]
now we're going to impute the value with

[06:40:30 - 06:40:35]
the median as we know the median value

[06:40:32 - 06:40:38]
is 9 3.5 we know uh some missing values

[06:40:35 - 06:40:40]
we have in this HP column we'll select

[06:40:38 - 06:40:42]
this whole column we'll filter uh the

[06:40:40 - 06:40:45]
values and here we will just select all

[06:40:42 - 06:40:47]
the values only we will select the

[06:40:45 - 06:40:50]
question mark character rows and uh we

[06:40:47 - 06:40:52]
are having here that foros three rows uh

[06:40:50 - 06:40:53]
with question mark we're going to impute

[06:40:52 - 06:40:56]
this how we're going to impute this

[06:40:53 - 06:40:59]
we'll select these uh rows we'll press

[06:40:56 - 06:41:02]
contr h here and you can see find what

[06:40:59 - 06:41:04]
replace with what so with replace with

[06:41:02 - 06:41:07]
93.5 just find this question mark rows

[06:41:04 - 06:41:09]
and replace this with the median value

[06:41:07 - 06:41:11]
when I click on replace all you can see

[06:41:09 - 06:41:14]
that all values got replaced with 93.5

[06:41:11 - 06:41:18]
and that's how we can impute the missing

[06:41:14 - 06:41:20]
values so that's how we can impute the

[06:41:18 - 06:41:23]
missing values uh if you have in your

[06:41:20 - 06:41:24]
data thank you now we're going to

[06:41:23 - 06:41:28]
understand if any columns are in the

[06:41:24 - 06:41:31]
incorrect format so how we can convert

[06:41:28 - 06:41:33]
the type of that values like how to

[06:41:31 - 06:41:36]
convert to other data type

[06:41:33 - 06:41:37]
by using Excel command so I'm giving

[06:41:36 - 06:41:39]
here as a prompt that write the Excel

[06:41:37 - 06:41:41]
command to convert data types if any

[06:41:39 - 06:41:43]
columns are in the incorrect format

[06:41:41 - 06:41:45]
convert them to the appropriate type for

[06:41:43 - 06:41:47]
the above data

[06:41:45 - 06:41:50]
set so when I enter this

[06:41:47 - 06:41:52]
prompt let's see what output we are

[06:41:50 - 06:41:54]
getting over here in Excel you can

[06:41:52 - 06:41:56]
convert data type using various method

[06:41:54 - 06:42:00]
here we are getting multiple ways to

[06:41:56 - 06:42:02]
convert the data type and uh we will

[06:42:00 - 06:42:07]
going to apply one way other ways you

[06:42:02 - 06:42:09]
can can apply later first way is

[06:42:07 - 06:42:13]
converting text to number if a column

[06:42:09 - 06:42:16]
has U numbers but the data type of that

[06:42:13 - 06:42:19]
column is text so we're going to convert

[06:42:16 - 06:42:22]
that column into number so how to do

[06:42:19 - 06:42:24]
that so select the cell column and which

[06:42:22 - 06:42:27]
containing the text you want to convert

[06:42:24 - 06:42:30]
and go to data Tab and click on text to

[06:42:27 - 06:42:32]
column that's how we can do follow the

[06:42:30 - 06:42:34]
wizard you choosing delimited or fixed

[06:42:32 - 06:42:36]
width as need and select the appropriate

[06:42:34 - 06:42:39]
data format one way is converting number

[06:42:36 - 06:42:43]
is stored as text another way is how to

[06:42:39 - 06:42:46]
convert dates stored as text so this is

[06:42:43 - 06:42:49]
the way to convert dates which is stored

[06:42:46 - 06:42:51]
as a text changing number format

[06:42:49 - 06:42:52]
converting text to proper case upper

[06:42:51 - 06:42:55]
case lower case so these all are the

[06:42:52 - 06:42:59]
ways to convert the values into the

[06:42:55 - 06:43:01]
respective data type now we're going to

[06:42:59 - 06:43:04]
perform for an example if I want to

[06:43:01 - 06:43:07]
convert text to number so how I can do

[06:43:04 - 06:43:09]
that so I have to select the cell or a

[06:43:07 - 06:43:11]
column which containing the text which

[06:43:09 - 06:43:14]
you want to convert after that go to the

[06:43:11 - 06:43:16]
data type so let's first select the cell

[06:43:14 - 06:43:20]
for an example if I select I want to

[06:43:16 - 06:43:23]
convert the value here is 130 uh for an

[06:43:20 - 06:43:26]
example uh let's say if I give here not

[06:43:23 - 06:43:29]
130 I'm giving here n okay this is text

[06:43:26 - 06:43:33]
now if I want to convert this value uh

[06:43:29 - 06:43:35]
with the data type number how to do that

[06:43:33 - 06:43:38]
so first I will select this next step

[06:43:35 - 06:43:41]
would be go to the data Tab and click on

[06:43:38 - 06:43:43]
text to column so when I go to data tab

[06:43:41 - 06:43:45]
where is data Tab and then after what

[06:43:43 - 06:43:48]
you have to select text to

[06:43:45 - 06:43:50]
column here you have to select what

[06:43:48 - 06:43:52]
character such as commas or typ

[06:43:50 - 06:43:54]
separated each field fixed with fields

[06:43:52 - 06:43:57]
are aligned in column with spaces

[06:43:54 - 06:44:00]
between each field now what is this we

[06:43:57 - 06:44:02]
check the last step follow the visard

[06:44:00 - 06:44:04]
choosing delimited or fixed bit as

[06:44:02 - 06:44:06]
needed and select appropriate data

[06:44:04 - 06:44:11]
format so I will select here for an

[06:44:06 - 06:44:11]
example delimited so when I will select

[06:44:12 - 06:44:15]
this after

[06:44:16 - 06:44:22]
this in which format you want to select

[06:44:19 - 06:44:24]
General date if you want to convert in

[06:44:22 - 06:44:27]
date the which way you want to convert

[06:44:24 - 06:44:30]
this that's how you can select and for

[06:44:27 - 06:44:32]
an example I want to convert uh in text

[06:44:30 - 06:44:36]
is already in text it is in the numeric

[06:44:32 - 06:44:39]
uh data type that n is not uh text over

[06:44:36 - 06:44:41]
here this n over here is what numerical

[06:44:39 - 06:44:44]
okay it is in the form of integer either

[06:44:41 - 06:44:48]
integer or flaw so how we can um convert

[06:44:44 - 06:44:51]
that so first click Text and then finish

[06:44:48 - 06:44:54]
so this particular value will get

[06:44:51 - 06:44:56]
changed to other data type which will be

[06:44:54 - 06:45:00]
Text data

[06:44:56 - 06:45:04]
type and change this value for now

[06:45:00 - 06:45:04]
should be 130

[06:45:09 - 06:45:15]
so now after um discussing about how to

[06:45:12 - 06:45:17]
convert data type as of now it is not

[06:45:15 - 06:45:21]
required in our data set so we'll not go

[06:45:17 - 06:45:23]
in deep but here the next prompt uh

[06:45:21 - 06:45:26]
which we really need to check is that to

[06:45:23 - 06:45:28]
calculate basic statistic for the data

[06:45:26 - 06:45:31]
set what we have already shared here so

[06:45:28 - 06:45:33]
we going to ask chat jpt write an Excel

[06:45:31 - 06:45:36]
command to calculate the base statistic

[06:45:33 - 06:45:40]
for the about data set when I enter this

[06:45:36 - 06:45:40]
prompt let's see what output we are

[06:45:40 - 06:45:44]
getting so now in Excel you can see the

[06:45:42 - 06:45:46]
output what you getting here is you can

[06:45:44 - 06:45:48]
calculate basic statistics such as mean

[06:45:46 - 06:45:51]
median which we have already discussed

[06:45:48 - 06:45:53]
like what is summary statistic and uh

[06:45:51 - 06:45:55]
What uh summary statistic covers

[06:45:53 - 06:45:57]
basically it covers mean median standard

[06:45:55 - 06:46:00]
deviation minimum and maximum value

[06:45:57 - 06:46:02]
using build-in function here so here how

[06:46:00 - 06:46:05]
we can apply these function we have some

[06:46:02 - 06:46:08]
inbu function uh in Excel which we can

[06:46:05 - 06:46:10]
apply directly and uh we can get these

[06:46:08 - 06:46:14]
values like mean median standard

[06:46:10 - 06:46:17]
deviation mode okay so first let's see

[06:46:14 - 06:46:22]
how to get the output based on this

[06:46:17 - 06:46:24]
function so here if I use this formula

[06:46:22 - 06:46:27]
what is this to get the mean value that

[06:46:24 - 06:46:30]
means to get the average of each column

[06:46:27 - 06:46:34]
so for an example if I want to know the

[06:46:30 - 06:46:36]
average so what I will do here I'll just

[06:46:34 - 06:46:39]
apply the formula here equal

[06:46:36 - 06:46:41]
to average automatically you will get

[06:46:39 - 06:46:45]
the name from drop- down list you just

[06:46:41 - 06:46:48]
select this and the formula is asking

[06:46:45 - 06:46:50]
you the range from where to where you

[06:46:48 - 06:46:52]
want the mean suppose if I want to

[06:46:50 - 06:46:55]
select for MPG column the average value

[06:46:52 - 06:46:57]
if I want to know of this First Column

[06:46:55 - 06:46:59]
that is MPG what I will do here I will

[06:46:57 - 06:47:02]
select the range so from where I want to

[06:46:59 - 06:47:05]
select from a to that means a column

[06:47:02 - 06:47:08]
second row till 399 as we have 399 rows

[06:47:05 - 06:47:13]
for this data set so I will select a

[06:47:08 - 06:47:15]
column second row from A2 to a399 so

[06:47:13 - 06:47:22]
I'll give here A2 after that I'll give

[06:47:15 - 06:47:24]
colum and A3 99 I'll close this with

[06:47:22 - 06:47:27]
parenthesis and when I will enter here

[06:47:24 - 06:47:29]
I'm getting the mean is

[06:47:27 - 06:47:32]
2349 this is the mean of this First

[06:47:29 - 06:47:34]
Column that's how you can check the

[06:47:32 - 06:47:36]
average that means the mean of other

[06:47:34 - 06:47:37]
column as well so now we're going to

[06:47:36 - 06:47:40]
understand the median so how we're going

[06:47:37 - 06:47:45]
to do that we're going to apply instead

[06:47:40 - 06:47:47]
of average median so equal to median

[06:47:45 - 06:47:49]
when you will type median automatically

[06:47:47 - 06:47:51]
you are getting this name in the drop-

[06:47:49 - 06:47:54]
down list and you just double click on

[06:47:51 - 06:47:56]
that again you have to give the range

[06:47:54 - 06:47:59]
from where to where you want the median

[06:47:56 - 06:48:03]
value I want now this time median for

[06:47:59 - 06:48:05]
this column that is cylinder Okay so so

[06:48:03 - 06:48:09]
I will select the range that means the

[06:48:05 - 06:48:16]
cylinder column is of B column and I

[06:48:09 - 06:48:16]
want range from B2 to B 399 so B2

[06:48:16 - 06:48:23]
column B

[06:48:19 - 06:48:27]
399 that is 399th row till 399th row I

[06:48:23 - 06:48:32]
want median value so when I enter I'm

[06:48:27 - 06:48:36]
getting here the median of uh b 2 to b39

[06:48:32 - 06:48:39]
9 is 4 so that's how we can calculate

[06:48:36 - 06:48:41]
the median and other statistics as well

[06:48:39 - 06:48:44]
as we have a standard deviation for that

[06:48:41 - 06:48:47]
you only have to apply what equal to

[06:48:44 - 06:48:49]
standard deviation the form is stdv that

[06:48:47 - 06:48:51]
is standard deviation you only have to

[06:48:49 - 06:48:53]
select the range from where to where you

[06:48:51 - 06:48:54]
want a standard devation obviously for

[06:48:53 - 06:48:56]
each column we have to select all the

[06:48:54 - 06:48:59]
values for the data set because we are

[06:48:56 - 06:49:01]
not analyzing few rows and columns we

[06:48:59 - 06:49:03]
are analyzing the whole data set so we

[06:49:01 - 06:49:06]
have to select the all value from The

[06:49:03 - 06:49:09]
Columns you can select minimum value

[06:49:06 - 06:49:11]
also how which one is the minimum let's

[06:49:09 - 06:49:15]
select this formula here I will apply

[06:49:11 - 06:49:19]
this for one column in my Excel

[06:49:15 - 06:49:19]
sheet let's apply

[06:49:21 - 06:49:29]
this minimum now here I will change the

[06:49:25 - 06:49:32]
range I want to check the minimum value

[06:49:29 - 06:49:37]
of this column origin so origin has uh

[06:49:32 - 06:49:40]
column H and from H2 to H 399 I want to

[06:49:37 - 06:49:43]
check the minimum value in this column

[06:49:40 - 06:49:46]
so H2

[06:49:43 - 06:49:50]
till H

[06:49:46 - 06:49:53]
399 when I will enter the minimum value

[06:49:50 - 06:49:56]
is one why I showed this because here we

[06:49:53 - 06:49:58]
can easily see that we only have three

[06:49:56 - 06:50:00]
origin right which we have already

[06:49:58 - 06:50:02]
discussed when we were analyzing the

[06:50:00 - 06:50:04]
data using python so here you can see

[06:50:02 - 06:50:06]
that we have three values 1 2 3 and out

[06:50:04 - 06:50:08]
of 1 2 3 one is the minimum value

[06:50:06 - 06:50:10]
correct from here it's very difficult to

[06:50:08 - 06:50:12]
find that uh the minimum value what we

[06:50:10 - 06:50:13]
are getting is correct or not but here

[06:50:12 - 06:50:16]
we know that in origin we have only

[06:50:13 - 06:50:18]
three values 1 2 3 and when we are

[06:50:16 - 06:50:19]
applying mean function we are getting

[06:50:18 - 06:50:22]
one that means we are getting the

[06:50:19 - 06:50:25]
correct output over here so that's how

[06:50:22 - 06:50:28]
we can uh get the final outcome based on

[06:50:25 - 06:50:30]
the uh different different formulas

[06:50:28 - 06:50:34]
which is used for statistical summary

[06:50:30 - 06:50:36]
now the next step is is how to perform

[06:50:34 - 06:50:39]
unival analysis using Excel command and

[06:50:36 - 06:50:42]
how to create charts for visualization

[06:50:39 - 06:50:44]
of the about data so the next prompt

[06:50:42 - 06:50:46]
what I am giving here

[06:50:44 - 06:50:49]
is write command in Excel to perform

[06:50:46 - 06:50:51]
unival analysis and how to create charts

[06:50:49 - 06:50:53]
for visualization of the about data when

[06:50:51 - 06:50:55]
I will enter this let's see what output

[06:50:53 - 06:50:58]
we are getting

[06:50:55 - 06:51:02]
here so univ analysis is basically what

[06:50:58 - 06:51:05]
if you want to visualize single variable

[06:51:02 - 06:51:08]
at a time so there we perform univariate

[06:51:05 - 06:51:10]
if you want to perform or if you want to

[06:51:08 - 06:51:12]
check the relationship between two

[06:51:10 - 06:51:16]
variables uh then there we will perform

[06:51:12 - 06:51:18]
byar analysis so here to perform Univar

[06:51:16 - 06:51:22]
analysis we'll use various plots we can

[06:51:18 - 06:51:26]
use histogram we can use box blot we can

[06:51:22 - 06:51:27]
use spy chart histogram is a common way

[06:51:26 - 06:51:30]
to visualize the distribution of

[06:51:27 - 06:51:34]
variable how the variable is distributed

[06:51:30 - 06:51:37]
and box FL is uh to check the median and

[06:51:34 - 06:51:41]
to check whether do we have outliers or

[06:51:37 - 06:51:43]
not so that's how we can do so here we

[06:51:41 - 06:51:45]
are getting uh different ways to

[06:51:43 - 06:51:48]
visualize uh the data visualization

[06:51:45 - 06:51:50]
using charts if you want to perform univ

[06:51:48 - 06:51:53]
analysis means if you want to analyze

[06:51:50 - 06:51:55]
single variable so one way is using

[06:51:53 - 06:51:57]
histogram for that you have to select

[06:51:55 - 06:51:59]
the data which you want to analyze and

[06:51:57 - 06:52:02]
then go to insert tab insert a statistic

[06:51:59 - 06:52:03]
chart and choose histogram when I go to

[06:52:02 - 06:52:07]
Excel sheet

[06:52:03 - 06:52:12]
I selected over here is origin values

[06:52:07 - 06:52:16]
from H2 till h84 I have selected now

[06:52:12 - 06:52:19]
I'll go to insert tab there I'll click

[06:52:16 - 06:52:22]
on recommended charts all chart I want

[06:52:19 - 06:52:26]
to select histogram so when I select

[06:52:22 - 06:52:29]
histogram I'm getting over here the

[06:52:26 - 06:52:33]
output so that's how my output is this

[06:52:29 - 06:52:35]
one is one then two and this one 3 so

[06:52:33 - 06:52:41]
that's how you can check which one has

[06:52:35 - 06:52:45]
the higher value series 1 how many value

[06:52:41 - 06:52:48]
till 59 okay so we are getting the

[06:52:45 - 06:52:53]
frequency uh which is distributed uh in

[06:52:48 - 06:52:58]
this column so 59 values of one and this

[06:52:53 - 06:53:01]
one is uh series 1.2 values two has 14

[06:52:58 - 06:53:05]
values so that's how you can visualize

[06:53:01 - 06:53:08]
uh the column using histogram so now

[06:53:05 - 06:53:11]
next what I'm going to visualize I'm

[06:53:08 - 06:53:15]
going to visualize uh the other colum

[06:53:11 - 06:53:18]
but using box plot so if I want to use

[06:53:15 - 06:53:20]
box plot only the process is same you

[06:53:18 - 06:53:23]
only have to select the values for which

[06:53:20 - 06:53:26]
you want to visualize uh through boxplot

[06:53:23 - 06:53:29]
go to insert tab go to that recommended

[06:53:26 - 06:53:31]
charts click on all charts and select

[06:53:29 - 06:53:34]
which one you want to select like for an

[06:53:31 - 06:53:36]
example here here is box and whisker the

[06:53:34 - 06:53:39]
other name is box and whisker plot only

[06:53:36 - 06:53:43]
so when I select box and whisker plot

[06:53:39 - 06:53:46]
here I'm getting the box plot for the

[06:53:43 - 06:53:49]
relatable values which I have selected

[06:53:46 - 06:53:51]
over here so that's how you can select

[06:53:49 - 06:53:56]
the box plot and you can visualize the

[06:53:51 - 06:53:59]
data now the next part is pie chart also

[06:53:56 - 06:54:02]
pie chart like how to visualize the data

[06:53:59 - 06:54:05]
using pie chart same way I want you all

[06:54:02 - 06:54:08]
to to explore this I apply the same way

[06:54:05 - 06:54:11]
as I applied for visualizing the data

[06:54:08 - 06:54:13]
using histogram and box plot same way

[06:54:11 - 06:54:15]
you have to uh go to insert tab there

[06:54:13 - 06:54:18]
you have to select recommended charts

[06:54:15 - 06:54:20]
and click on all charts and select the

[06:54:18 - 06:54:22]
pie chart option before that you have to

[06:54:20 - 06:54:26]
select the data for which you want to

[06:54:22 - 06:54:29]
visualize through py chart so this is uh

[06:54:26 - 06:54:32]
the way to be analyze the single

[06:54:29 - 06:54:35]
variables each variables of our data set

[06:54:32 - 06:54:36]
using different different charts which

[06:54:35 - 06:54:40]
comes under univ

[06:54:36 - 06:54:42]
analysis thank you now let's see how

[06:54:40 - 06:54:45]
chat GPT can supercharge your

[06:54:42 - 06:54:48]
productivity within the Microsoft suit

[06:54:45 - 06:54:52]
first we'll dive into chart GPT for

[06:54:48 - 06:54:55]

[06:54:55 - 06:55:02]
and and simplify data management then

[06:54:59 - 06:55:05]
we'll explore chat GPT for micros

[06:55:02 - 06:55:09]
Micosoft PowerPoint learn how chart GPT

[06:55:05 - 06:55:12]
can help you with creating compelling

[06:55:09 - 06:55:15]
presentations generating content and

[06:55:12 - 06:55:19]
streamlining your workflow stay tuned to

[06:55:15 - 06:55:22]
see how chat GPT can transform your

[06:55:19 - 06:55:27]
experience with Microsoft Excel and

[06:55:22 - 06:55:30]
PowerPoint making your tasks easier and

[06:55:27 - 06:55:32]
more efficient okay so now what if we

[06:55:30 - 06:55:34]
want to calculate the average of of

[06:55:32 - 06:55:36]
let's say column number D that is

[06:55:34 - 06:55:39]
quarter 3 Revenue what if I want what is

[06:55:36 - 06:55:41]
the average of it and considering that

[06:55:39 - 06:55:43]
if I am a lay man and I don't know how

[06:55:41 - 06:55:45]
to use Excel how would I do that in in a

[06:55:43 - 06:55:48]
shorter way right so I'll just so what

[06:55:45 - 06:55:51]
will I do I'll just go to chat GPT and

[06:55:48 - 06:55:53]
I'll write in the prompt right so now I

[06:55:51 - 06:55:56]
I I'll just check in the data set so if

[06:55:53 - 06:55:59]
it is column number D right D2 to let's

[06:55:56 - 06:56:00]
say D20 right I need a average of it

[06:55:59 - 06:56:02]
right so I'll just mention the row

[06:56:00 - 06:56:05]
numbers as D2

[06:56:02 - 06:56:10]
to D20

[06:56:05 - 06:56:10]
right so I'll write this

[06:56:10 - 06:56:15]
so so it will give me what what needs to

[06:56:13 - 06:56:18]
be done so right so the the function

[06:56:15 - 06:56:20]
that is used is equal to average now

[06:56:18 - 06:56:22]
I'll just simply click on this cell

[06:56:20 - 06:56:24]
right here and paste in that formula the

[06:56:22 - 06:56:27]
syntax and it just gives me it seel it

[06:56:24 - 06:56:29]
automatically selects the range right so

[06:56:27 - 06:56:31]
if I give them the starting and the end

[06:56:29 - 06:56:34]
it'll just directly do that right so

[06:56:31 - 06:56:37]
that's that's how CH gbd can enhance the

[06:56:34 - 06:56:40]
way you're working on Excel right it

[06:56:37 - 06:56:42]
will make your life much more easier

[06:56:40 - 06:56:47]
right so here it gives me

[06:56:42 - 06:56:50]
54619 is the average revenue of quarter

[06:56:47 - 06:56:52]
3 combining all the companies right here

[06:56:50 - 06:56:56]
right so if I want to do it the other

[06:56:52 - 06:57:00]
way if I just want like to give me the

[06:56:56 - 06:57:02]
the average of uh of the same company in

[06:57:00 - 06:57:05]
all the four quarters What would that

[06:57:02 - 06:57:08]
how would that go would just have to

[06:57:05 - 06:57:12]
mention them okay if it is the same row

[06:57:08 - 06:57:14]
then it will be B2 C2 D2 E2 if I'm

[06:57:12 - 06:57:17]
considering the first company right here

[06:57:14 - 06:57:19]
right so that can also be done now what

[06:57:17 - 06:57:22]
do I have to do is that I need to

[06:57:19 - 06:57:24]
calculate how many times is like let's

[06:57:22 - 06:57:27]
say what are the total number of movies

[06:57:24 - 06:57:31]
in English French and Italian right how

[06:57:27 - 06:57:32]
would I do that right so if I know okay

[06:57:31 - 06:57:34]
if there are four langu angues right

[06:57:32 - 06:57:37]
here or five languages or how many other

[06:57:34 - 06:57:40]
languages I want to segregate I want to

[06:57:37 - 06:57:42]
find how how many are there how many uh

[06:57:40 - 06:57:44]
let's say English movies are there how

[06:57:42 - 06:57:46]
many French movies how many Italian

[06:57:44 - 06:57:50]
movies how would I do that okay so I'll

[06:57:46 - 06:57:55]
just type in the prompt

[06:57:50 - 06:57:56]
that how to calculate the total number

[06:57:55 - 06:58:02]
of

[06:57:56 - 06:58:05]
times a word has been repeated

[06:58:02 - 06:58:05]
in

[06:58:08 - 06:58:15]
a

[06:58:11 - 06:58:22]
column Comm okay

[06:58:15 - 06:58:26]
write a SX for the

[06:58:22 - 06:58:26]
same Excel

[06:58:27 - 06:58:33]
right so it tells me that the the the

[06:58:30 - 06:58:35]
function that I I'm going to use is

[06:58:33 - 06:58:38]
Count F right so in the previous module

[06:58:35 - 06:58:40]
when I talked about a generalized bit of

[06:58:38 - 06:58:42]
key functions that are important I

[06:58:40 - 06:58:44]
talked about count F right to count the

[06:58:42 - 06:58:48]
number of times a certain thing has come

[06:58:44 - 06:58:51]
up right so the same thing is what is

[06:58:48 - 06:58:53]
mentioned over here right is just that I

[06:58:51 - 06:58:55]
gave you that reference so that you

[06:58:53 - 06:58:57]
would have an idea of it if I was a lay

[06:58:55 - 06:58:58]
man if I was just starting out I

[06:58:57 - 06:59:01]
definitely would not know what count if

[06:58:58 - 06:59:04]
is now in a very simplest of the terms

[06:59:01 - 06:59:07]
what I did I just added a prompt here to

[06:59:04 - 06:59:09]
ask GPT the computer how to calculate

[06:59:07 - 06:59:11]
the total number of times a word has

[06:59:09 - 06:59:14]
been repeated in a column write the

[06:59:11 - 06:59:15]
Syntax for the same right this is

[06:59:14 - 06:59:16]
basically I'm telling that okay this is

[06:59:15 - 06:59:19]
the problem that I'm facing find a

[06:59:16 - 06:59:21]
solution that's your job because this is

[06:59:19 - 06:59:23]
like an AI assistant it'll help you in

[06:59:21 - 06:59:25]
whatever ways that you would want right

[06:59:23 - 06:59:28]
so it has given me an example also how

[06:59:25 - 06:59:30]
to do that right so I'll just just copy

[06:59:28 - 06:59:33]
this right here it has given me an

[06:59:30 - 06:59:36]
option so I'll just let's just put it

[06:59:33 - 06:59:37]
over here right so it will give me zero

[06:59:36 - 06:59:40]
because nothing is there so I'll just

[06:59:37 - 06:59:42]
edit it out the range right now I'll

[06:59:40 - 06:59:45]
just remove the range section I'll just

[06:59:42 - 06:59:49]
type I'll just drag and drop all this

[06:59:45 - 06:59:51]
entire AG from B2 to B22 right then what

[06:59:49 - 06:59:53]
are the criteria I'm looking for for for

[06:59:51 - 06:59:55]
English I'm looking for English right so

[06:59:53 - 06:59:58]
I'll write

[06:59:55 - 07:00:00]
English English right so I'll just print

[06:59:58 - 07:00:02]
and enter right so now it has given me

[07:00:00 - 07:00:05]
the exact number of count

[07:00:02 - 07:00:06]
that English is repeated in column B

[07:00:05 - 07:00:09]
right so if you want to check it if you

[07:00:06 - 07:00:11]
want to cross check 1

[07:00:09 - 07:00:15]
2

[07:00:11 - 07:00:17]
3 4 and five so that's accurate so

[07:00:15 - 07:00:19]
similarly if I have to find how many

[07:00:17 - 07:00:21]
times the word French has repeated in

[07:00:19 - 07:00:23]
column B how would I do that I'll just

[07:00:21 - 07:00:27]
copy the same syntax that chart GPT

[07:00:23 - 07:00:30]
provided me change the range from

[07:00:27 - 07:00:35]
B from A to

[07:00:30 - 07:00:40]
B then then a22 B22

[07:00:35 - 07:00:44]
right 22 right then Apple changing apple

[07:00:40 - 07:00:46]
to French right then I press enter so

[07:00:44 - 07:00:50]
now the French has also been repeated

[07:00:46 - 07:00:50]
five times similar thing I have to do

[07:00:52 - 07:00:57]
for just removing

[07:00:54 - 07:00:59]
Fringe and just adding Italian and now

[07:00:57 - 07:01:04]
it's selecting a different range I'll

[07:00:59 - 07:01:06]
just give it the range that I want right

[07:01:04 - 07:01:08]
and I'll just press enter so six is the

[07:01:06 - 07:01:10]
number of time

[07:01:08 - 07:01:12]
Italian uh is repeated in column number

[07:01:10 - 07:01:15]
B so we can state in general if we have

[07:01:12 - 07:01:17]
a problem statement how many movies are

[07:01:15 - 07:01:20]
in English five in the entire data set

[07:01:17 - 07:01:22]
how many are in French five how many how

[07:01:20 - 07:01:24]
many are in Italian six so we'll get a

[07:01:22 - 07:01:26]
generalized way so I did not do anything

[07:01:24 - 07:01:28]
on my own I just asked chart GPT as an

[07:01:26 - 07:01:31]
AI assistant that okay help me solve

[07:01:28 - 07:01:33]
this part so it did right the second

[07:01:31 - 07:01:36]
thing that talked about was trim right

[07:01:33 - 07:01:40]
so I'll just ask chat GPT if there are

[07:01:36 - 07:01:42]
unwanted spaces right I'll just ask if

[07:01:40 - 07:01:44]
there are

[07:01:42 - 07:01:48]
unwanted

[07:01:44 - 07:01:48]
space in a

[07:01:48 - 07:01:59]
Cell at the start what syntax should I

[07:01:56 - 07:02:02]
use right I'll just type it out and

[07:01:59 - 07:02:04]
let's see what it has to say right so it

[07:02:02 - 07:02:06]
gives me the exact command that I was

[07:02:04 - 07:02:08]
referring to it gives me that okay it

[07:02:06 - 07:02:10]
knows you want to use trim because this

[07:02:08 - 07:02:13]
is how you would get rid of The Unwanted

[07:02:10 - 07:02:16]
spaces that are there right it just

[07:02:13 - 07:02:19]
mentions gives me a exact thing how to

[07:02:16 - 07:02:24]
do it so I'll just copy this I'll just

[07:02:19 - 07:02:27]
create another column right here right

[07:02:24 - 07:02:33]
and I'll just write that thing here

[07:02:27 - 07:02:37]
right so trim a trim this right

[07:02:33 - 07:02:42]
trim a I'll just start with

[07:02:37 - 07:02:45]
A2 right so now I'll just write

[07:02:42 - 07:02:47]
here

[07:02:45 - 07:02:50]
correct

[07:02:47 - 07:02:52]
range right I'll just make another

[07:02:50 - 07:02:55]
column bold it

[07:02:52 - 07:02:58]
maybe right now this is the thing equal

[07:02:55 - 07:03:01]
to trim and the cell I have to click on

[07:02:58 - 07:03:04]
that cell or just type out the cell name

[07:03:01 - 07:03:06]
so what I will do I'll just since it

[07:03:04 - 07:03:08]
understands so I'll just drag and drop

[07:03:06 - 07:03:11]
till the very end and now as we can see

[07:03:08 - 07:03:14]
right here in in row number eight there

[07:03:11 - 07:03:17]
was this much unwanted uh space right in

[07:03:14 - 07:03:20]
number 12 that was there in number 17 it

[07:03:17 - 07:03:22]
was there 1918 so that extra space that

[07:03:20 - 07:03:23]
unwanted space is now gone right now you

[07:03:22 - 07:03:27]
get a

[07:03:23 - 07:03:29]
clear uncluttered view of that movie

[07:03:27 - 07:03:32]
title column right this is how you use

[07:03:29 - 07:03:34]
trim right

[07:03:32 - 07:03:36]
now let's just take another example

[07:03:34 - 07:03:38]
right if I want a set number of

[07:03:36 - 07:03:41]
characters right if I want to extract

[07:03:38 - 07:03:44]
let's say this is a data set that gives

[07:03:41 - 07:03:46]
me the name of that state right Indiana

[07:03:44 - 07:03:48]
Delaware and all all this and the county

[07:03:46 - 07:03:50]
names with their PIN codes now if I want

[07:03:48 - 07:03:52]
to just extract the PIN codes right I

[07:03:50 - 07:03:54]
just want the PIN code to be out there

[07:03:52 - 07:03:56]
right how would I do that I know that

[07:03:54 - 07:03:59]
PIN code is of six letters right here

[07:03:56 - 07:04:00]
right six all it is the same now I want

[07:03:59 - 07:04:02]
to extract it how would I do that I

[07:04:00 - 07:04:04]
don't know I would ask chat gbt how to

[07:04:02 - 07:04:09]
do that so let's just

[07:04:04 - 07:04:13]
ask how do I

[07:04:09 - 07:04:13]
exract five

[07:04:15 - 07:04:27]
letters in the left of a cell and

[07:04:22 - 07:04:29]
add the same in a

[07:04:27 - 07:04:32]
new

[07:04:29 - 07:04:36]
column right

[07:04:32 - 07:04:39]
so let's just see what Char GPD has to

[07:04:36 - 07:04:43]
answer so as we also read before that we

[07:04:39 - 07:04:44]
can use a syntax called as left right

[07:04:43 - 07:04:47]
how do you use that again it has

[07:04:44 - 07:04:49]
mentioned number of how to use that I'll

[07:04:47 - 07:04:51]
just copy this I'll just paste since I

[07:04:49 - 07:04:55]
want from the left of this cell I'll

[07:04:51 - 07:04:59]
just paste this right I'll just change

[07:04:55 - 07:05:03]
the the cell

[07:04:59 - 07:05:06]
to B2 I'll just add the number of

[07:05:03 - 07:05:09]
characters I want right I want six

[07:05:06 - 07:05:11]
letters so I'll just move it to six and

[07:05:09 - 07:05:14]
there you go I have extracted the first

[07:05:11 - 07:05:17]
six letters here and I can drag and drop

[07:05:14 - 07:05:20]
to the entire thing right so this is the

[07:05:17 - 07:05:23]
thing so basically now the change the

[07:05:20 - 07:05:25]
shift of using Excel is how either you

[07:05:23 - 07:05:27]
can learn how to use Excel that's number

[07:05:25 - 07:05:29]
one but if you don't want to sacrifice

[07:05:27 - 07:05:32]
on that if you just want a shorter way

[07:05:29 - 07:05:35]
ahead if you just want that my workflow

[07:05:32 - 07:05:37]
is is smooth it's faster it's quick then

[07:05:35 - 07:05:39]
I I do not have the bandwidth or the the

[07:05:37 - 07:05:42]
time to learn Excel what I would do I

[07:05:39 - 07:05:44]
would just add chat GPT how to do that

[07:05:42 - 07:05:46]
so now I've extracted so I now what

[07:05:44 - 07:05:48]
would happen is that I'm given a

[07:05:46 - 07:05:50]
business problem the first approach is

[07:05:48 - 07:05:54]
to go to chat GPT of course use your

[07:05:50 - 07:05:56]
brain but the first element is to just

[07:05:54 - 07:05:59]
know what uh chat GP can answer right

[07:05:56 - 07:06:02]
it'll give you some idea of or the other

[07:05:59 - 07:06:04]
right so next we can also talk about uh

[07:06:02 - 07:06:07]
kinat right we we spoke about how it is

[07:06:04 - 07:06:13]
used but uh again let let me just show

[07:06:07 - 07:06:16]
you how you can use it what if I want to

[07:06:13 - 07:06:20]
combine two

[07:06:16 - 07:06:24]
cells and add it in a

[07:06:20 - 07:06:28]
new column how would I do that tell

[07:06:24 - 07:06:30]
me so it it mentions you have to use the

[07:06:28 - 07:06:32]
function known as concatenate the syntax

[07:06:30 - 07:06:35]
is mentioned right right here I'll just

[07:06:32 - 07:06:37]
copy the intax WR here how to use it now

[07:06:35 - 07:06:40]
the best part about Char GPT is it would

[07:06:37 - 07:06:43]
give you a Hands-On V just needs to be

[07:06:40 - 07:06:45]
done also it will give you a brief bit

[07:06:43 - 07:06:47]
of a brief of how how things are

[07:06:45 - 07:06:49]
happening right it will not give you

[07:06:47 - 07:06:50]
anything too Wiig that is not true of

[07:06:49 - 07:06:54]
course you can try it out you can check

[07:06:50 - 07:06:56]
it out but yeah you can get what you

[07:06:54 - 07:06:59]
want from it right so I I have used skin

[07:06:56 - 07:07:03]
catenate here in instead of this I just

[07:06:59 - 07:07:05]
changed my uh range right I'll just I

[07:07:03 - 07:07:09]
want this first name and the second name

[07:07:05 - 07:07:11]
to come in the same cell so there you go

[07:07:09 - 07:07:14]
I got it I got the the name together

[07:07:11 - 07:07:16]
combined right similarly I'll just drag

[07:07:14 - 07:07:17]
and drop till the very end and it'll

[07:07:16 - 07:07:21]
give me

[07:07:17 - 07:07:25]
a the entire combination of column A and

[07:07:21 - 07:07:28]
column B right so right so next uh let's

[07:07:25 - 07:07:32]
just uh say another thing let's just

[07:07:28 - 07:07:35]
find out the number of character is that

[07:07:32 - 07:07:37]
they there right so how would I do that

[07:07:35 - 07:07:40]
how do I

[07:07:37 - 07:07:46]
find the

[07:07:40 - 07:07:47]
count the count of characters in a

[07:07:46 - 07:07:49]
single

[07:07:47 - 07:07:53]
cell how do I do

[07:07:49 - 07:07:55]
that just type in so it's basically

[07:07:53 - 07:07:57]
typing out what you are thinking what

[07:07:55 - 07:08:00]
you thinking right it just gives me the

[07:07:57 - 07:08:03]
the thing that I can use equal to Len

[07:08:00 - 07:08:06]
and this trite it out so

[07:08:03 - 07:08:06]
right

[07:08:08 - 07:08:14]
count make another column count add my

[07:08:12 - 07:08:16]
syntax it's just taking another cell

[07:08:14 - 07:08:20]
I'll just delete it it's just a dummy

[07:08:16 - 07:08:23]
cell just add cell name E2 and press

[07:08:20 - 07:08:28]
enter so it tells me okay Miss Jerry 1 2

[07:08:23 - 07:08:32]
3 4 5 6 78 9 gives me the correct order

[07:08:28 - 07:08:34]
9 and similarly I can do now now the

[07:08:32 - 07:08:36]
point is that would also take into

[07:08:34 - 07:08:39]
considerate the space if I have a blank

[07:08:36 - 07:08:41]
here right it'll increase it to 10 right

[07:08:39 - 07:08:43]
so it takes in consideration of all the

[07:08:41 - 07:08:45]
blanks that are there as well right the

[07:08:43 - 07:08:48]
similar thing if I just don't want this

[07:08:45 - 07:08:51]
I just want another cell let's say this

[07:08:48 - 07:08:54]
one so I just put enter right and then

[07:08:51 - 07:08:57]
the best part I can just drag and drop

[07:08:54 - 07:08:59]
and it will come off the column B right

[07:08:57 - 07:09:02]
so these are the things that you can

[07:08:59 - 07:09:04]
work on right what if I want to

[07:09:02 - 07:09:05]
calculate the weighted average of a

[07:09:04 - 07:09:08]
range of sales how would I do that right

[07:09:05 - 07:09:10]
so I'll just type in calculate the

[07:09:08 - 07:09:12]
weight weighted average right so it

[07:09:10 - 07:09:14]
would give me what is the parameter in

[07:09:12 - 07:09:16]
which I have to do right so it says that

[07:09:14 - 07:09:18]
some product is the the aspect that I

[07:09:16 - 07:09:21]
need to look at right so I will have to

[07:09:18 - 07:09:23]
mention my range one range two then sum

[07:09:21 - 07:09:27]
the sum of range two right so this is

[07:09:23 - 07:09:29]
how the the exact weighted average will

[07:09:27 - 07:09:32]
come right so we can get that as well if

[07:09:29 - 07:09:35]
you want to right what else can we do

[07:09:32 - 07:09:36]
let's just look at some other things

[07:09:35 - 07:09:39]
what if I want to create a drop- down

[07:09:36 - 07:09:40]
list of a cell right of a range of a

[07:09:39 - 07:09:42]
column right so what how would I do that

[07:09:40 - 07:09:45]
how would I create a drop down list

[07:09:42 - 07:09:47]
right so I would ask it to tell me how

[07:09:45 - 07:09:50]
it is now one thing that you have to

[07:09:47 - 07:09:53]
know about it is that the things that

[07:09:50 - 07:09:56]
are here right it in a in a single

[07:09:53 - 07:09:58]
thread it has its own memory right so if

[07:09:56 - 07:09:59]
I'm just writing it down a thing I don't

[07:09:58 - 07:10:02]
have to mention that okay tell me in

[07:09:59 - 07:10:04]
Excel in Excel in every prompt it would

[07:10:02 - 07:10:06]
have the memory of the entire the this

[07:10:04 - 07:10:08]
entire thread that we are talking about

[07:10:06 - 07:10:10]
right it knows that the context is about

[07:10:08 - 07:10:12]
Excel it knows that okay the things that

[07:10:10 - 07:10:15]
we are talking about is of excel right

[07:10:12 - 07:10:17]
so it will just give me that the entire

[07:10:15 - 07:10:19]
thing that will come up here right so it

[07:10:17 - 07:10:22]
it is stating me that to create a drop

[07:10:19 - 07:10:24]
down list with the values from B20 you

[07:10:22 - 07:10:26]
can use data validation here is the

[07:10:24 - 07:10:27]
thing right select the range of sales

[07:10:26 - 07:10:29]
you want to drop down list for example

[07:10:27 - 07:10:31]
assume that you want to create go to the

[07:10:29 - 07:10:33]
data tab in the Excel click on data

[07:10:31 - 07:10:35]
validation data validation dialog Bo

[07:10:33 - 07:10:38]
open settings tab allow drop down choose

[07:10:35 - 07:10:39]
list so so you can do it in this regard

[07:10:38 - 07:10:42]
so anything that you have in your mind

[07:10:39 - 07:10:43]
that that is even a wild thought that

[07:10:42 - 07:10:45]
okay this is the things that we can

[07:10:43 - 07:10:47]
change in Excel right but you have no

[07:10:45 - 07:10:49]
clue how to do that you can just type it

[07:10:47 - 07:10:51]
out in Excel it would definitely have

[07:10:49 - 07:10:53]
some of the other way to assist you on

[07:10:51 - 07:10:55]
what you want to do right this was about

[07:10:53 - 07:10:57]
the general basic prompts in which you

[07:10:55 - 07:10:59]
can know what is happening how it is

[07:10:57 - 07:11:02]
happening right so now in this module

[07:10:59 - 07:11:04]
let's just first try and understand

[07:11:02 - 07:11:06]
certain functions that are there so you

[07:11:04 - 07:11:08]
really do not need to know all this when

[07:11:06 - 07:11:12]
when you're are working around with with

[07:11:08 - 07:11:13]
chat GPT knowing Excel but I'll give you

[07:11:12 - 07:11:15]
a brief about it so that you would have

[07:11:13 - 07:11:17]
a secondary thinking on how the

[07:11:15 - 07:11:20]
functions also work along with how you

[07:11:17 - 07:11:22]
can make charity work around these

[07:11:20 - 07:11:24]
functions right so the first very

[07:11:22 - 07:11:26]
important function that is there is

[07:11:24 - 07:11:28]
known as count if so what is that

[07:11:26 - 07:11:30]
function what does it do so function

[07:11:28 - 07:11:33]
that counts the number of cells that

[07:11:30 - 07:11:34]
match a specific condition right so in a

[07:11:33 - 07:11:37]
range of things what is the specific

[07:11:34 - 07:11:38]
conditions that I I opted for so it will

[07:11:37 - 07:11:40]
count right it will count the number of

[07:11:38 - 07:11:43]
cells that match that condition so that

[07:11:40 - 07:11:46]
is known as count if now the basic

[07:11:43 - 07:11:48]
syntax of a function when you write in

[07:11:46 - 07:11:50]
Excel is equals to sign then you would

[07:11:48 - 07:11:53]
write the name of that function here it

[07:11:50 - 07:11:56]
is Count F so I'll write count F I'll

[07:11:53 - 07:11:58]
type it out count F then open

[07:11:56 - 07:12:00]
parenthesis so Open Bracket then the

[07:11:58 - 07:12:02]
range I would select so I would randomly

[07:12:00 - 07:12:04]
click on on Excel so how do we select

[07:12:02 - 07:12:07]
the range let's say you have uh this

[07:12:04 - 07:12:09]
data that we created so uh my range

[07:12:07 - 07:12:13]
would be let's say from the cell so from

[07:12:09 - 07:12:16]
the cell let's say D3 to let's say any

[07:12:13 - 07:12:19]
anything of that sort right so this is

[07:12:16 - 07:12:24]
d63 62 right so

[07:12:19 - 07:12:27]
from D3 to d62 would be my range right

[07:12:24 - 07:12:29]
so I would just drag uh drag it through

[07:12:27 - 07:12:32]
the column and that would become my

[07:12:29 - 07:12:33]
range and then the conditions that I

[07:12:32 - 07:12:36]
want so if I want to search a specific

[07:12:33 - 07:12:37]
word so I'll just put it in in in the

[07:12:36 - 07:12:40]
inverted commas just write that

[07:12:37 - 07:12:41]
condition and close brackets and enter

[07:12:40 - 07:12:44]
so it would give me in that range how

[07:12:41 - 07:12:46]
many times that specific uh instance

[07:12:44 - 07:12:49]
specific condition has been met so this

[07:12:46 - 07:12:50]
this is what uh count if does that's the

[07:12:49 - 07:12:53]
first function the second function is

[07:12:50 - 07:12:55]
length so a function that Returns the

[07:12:53 - 07:12:57]
length of a text Springs right so what

[07:12:55 - 07:12:59]
would be the length of that word what

[07:12:57 - 07:13:02]
would be the length of that string right

[07:12:59 - 07:13:05]
so it would give me that number so what

[07:13:02 - 07:13:07]
is the syntax equal to l n Open Bracket

[07:13:05 - 07:13:09]
the cell that I need to select close

[07:13:07 - 07:13:12]
bracket so that would be the second

[07:13:09 - 07:13:13]
function the third is left and right so

[07:13:12 - 07:13:16]
if I want to extract like the function

[07:13:13 - 07:13:19]
that returns specific numbers specific

[07:13:16 - 07:13:21]
number of characters from from a cell

[07:13:19 - 07:13:23]
right from the left side or the right

[07:13:21 - 07:13:26]
side in that in a Cell right so it would

[07:13:23 - 07:13:28]
give me the number of characters so left

[07:13:26 - 07:13:30]
the cell number of characters right cell

[07:13:28 - 07:13:33]
number of characters I'll tell you how

[07:13:30 - 07:13:35]
it is important how would you know that

[07:13:33 - 07:13:37]
I would give you a brief on that then is

[07:13:35 - 07:13:40]
concatenate a function that combines

[07:13:37 - 07:13:42]
multiple text cells into a single cells

[07:13:40 - 07:13:45]
for example that you know if I want to

[07:13:42 - 07:13:47]
combine a lot of multiple text into one

[07:13:45 - 07:13:50]
single cell then it would help for

[07:13:47 - 07:13:52]
example uh I'll just take first name

[07:13:50 - 07:13:54]
second name I just want to merge it in

[07:13:52 - 07:13:57]
one thing then I'll use concatenate cell

[07:13:54 - 07:14:00]
one cell two then it'll merge

[07:13:57 - 07:14:02]
right then is the trim function which

[07:14:00 - 07:14:05]
removes X extra unwanted space that are

[07:14:02 - 07:14:08]
there from the cell right so this is

[07:14:05 - 07:14:10]
done through trim command equal to trim

[07:14:08 - 07:14:13]
open fance the the cell select that cell

[07:14:10 - 07:14:15]
close bracket right so let's just move

[07:14:13 - 07:14:18]
into charge let's just understand

[07:14:15 - 07:14:20]
certain prompts of this regard okay

[07:14:18 - 07:14:22]
let's just take an example of this data

[07:14:20 - 07:14:24]
set right in which I have number of

[07:14:22 - 07:14:26]
companies mentioned here random

[07:14:24 - 07:14:28]
companies and it's uh Revenue per

[07:14:26 - 07:14:30]
quarter so quarter 1 quarter 2 quarter 3

[07:14:28 - 07:14:33]
and quarter 4 right now if I want to

[07:14:30 - 07:14:34]
know the sum of all these right sum of

[07:14:33 - 07:14:39]
all these how would I know what would be

[07:14:34 - 07:14:42]
the thing to know the the the sum from

[07:14:39 - 07:14:44]
each cell right so I can just understand

[07:14:42 - 07:14:47]
okay this cell number is what what is

[07:14:44 - 07:14:51]
the cell name E2 what is the cell name

[07:14:47 - 07:14:53]
here E20 now I can just go to charge and

[07:14:51 - 07:14:56]
write I just give it a prompt that write

[07:14:53 - 07:15:01]
an Excel formula to add up the values in

[07:14:56 - 07:15:03]
cells E2 through E10 so from E2 to E 10

[07:15:01 - 07:15:06]
what are the values I want want it to

[07:15:03 - 07:15:09]
give me how I can do that how I can sum

[07:15:06 - 07:15:11]
I can't just go to Excel and just be

[07:15:09 - 07:15:14]
like I want to I I open up a calculator

[07:15:11 - 07:15:16]
and I just add I I add individual values

[07:15:14 - 07:15:18]
and sum it right it would not work in

[07:15:16 - 07:15:21]
that regard right so what would I do

[07:15:18 - 07:15:23]
right what would I do so I would just

[07:15:21 - 07:15:24]
ask chat GPT if I'm a Layman I don't

[07:15:23 - 07:15:28]
know how to use Excel I'll just write

[07:15:24 - 07:15:31]
write in formula to add up the values in

[07:15:28 - 07:15:33]
cells E2 through E20 right so so I'll

[07:15:31 - 07:15:35]
just typee it out so now it will give me

[07:15:33 - 07:15:38]
the formula to add up the values in cell

[07:15:35 - 07:15:41]
E2 to E20 in in Excel you can use some

[07:15:38 - 07:15:43]
function here's the formula so as I

[07:15:41 - 07:15:45]
already mentioned that a function right

[07:15:43 - 07:15:48]
in Excel would start from an equality

[07:15:45 - 07:15:51]
sign then the name now if I want to do

[07:15:48 - 07:15:54]
sum it it just gives me sum and then

[07:15:51 - 07:15:56]
Open Bracket the range right so I'll

[07:15:54 - 07:15:58]
just copy paste this and let's see if it

[07:15:56 - 07:15:59]
works or not right I'll just randomly

[07:15:58 - 07:16:01]
place it

[07:15:59 - 07:16:05]
here right

[07:16:01 - 07:16:07]
now I'll just put enter now charge

[07:16:05 - 07:16:09]
without knowing what that data is

[07:16:07 - 07:16:11]
without knowing what it is it just tells

[07:16:09 - 07:16:14]
me okay this is how you sum it right now

[07:16:11 - 07:16:16]
I can just cross verify the thing here

[07:16:14 - 07:16:18]
right it just gives me equal to I'll put

[07:16:16 - 07:16:22]
the same

[07:16:18 - 07:16:25]
formula equal to sum Open Bracket I'll

[07:16:22 - 07:16:28]
just click on the entire range over here

[07:16:25 - 07:16:30]
and then close parenthesis and enter

[07:16:28 - 07:16:32]
right so it will give me the same answer

[07:16:30 - 07:16:34]
right is just that I did not know if I

[07:16:32 - 07:16:37]
did not know the the thing called equal

[07:16:34 - 07:16:38]
to sum what should I do should I Google

[07:16:37 - 07:16:40]
it out or is it a better way to just

[07:16:38 - 07:16:42]
give it okay this is the sell this is

[07:16:40 - 07:16:44]
the thing I want to do just tell me how

[07:16:42 - 07:16:47]
to do it right so it can act as your

[07:16:44 - 07:16:49]
assistant to just get rid of the mundane

[07:16:47 - 07:16:51]
tasks that are there right you can even

[07:16:49 - 07:16:53]
ask chgb to make you a dashboard of

[07:16:51 - 07:16:55]
various things right you want to analyze

[07:16:53 - 07:16:57]
Trends if you want to visualize a lot of

[07:16:55 - 07:17:00]
things right you can ask it to give us

[07:16:57 - 07:17:03]
give it formulas or give it the syntax

[07:17:00 - 07:17:05]
of how you you can modify the data

[07:17:03 - 07:17:07]
analyze the data you know manipulate

[07:17:05 - 07:17:09]
that data in the Regard in which your

[07:17:07 - 07:17:12]
problem statements the solution to your

[07:17:09 - 07:17:14]
problem statements are met right so the

[07:17:12 - 07:17:16]
second aspect that I would be talking

[07:17:14 - 07:17:19]
about is uh let's just take another

[07:17:16 - 07:17:21]
example now let's just take this uh data

[07:17:19 - 07:17:23]
set right there so there is a thing

[07:17:21 - 07:17:25]
called log price now it has a lot of

[07:17:23 - 07:17:28]
decimals right here right but I don't

[07:17:25 - 07:17:30]
want these kind of decimals I just want

[07:17:28 - 07:17:32]
a round whole number to the closest

[07:17:30 - 07:17:34]
value value that is there right so how

[07:17:32 - 07:17:36]
would I do that how would I round it off

[07:17:34 - 07:17:39]
I do not know it certainly right so I

[07:17:36 - 07:17:41]
would just ask chat GPT I would ask it

[07:17:39 - 07:17:44]
to just give me that sort of thing write

[07:17:41 - 07:17:47]
a formula to round a number in a cell to

[07:17:44 - 07:17:49]
the nearest whole number right so I'll

[07:17:47 - 07:17:51]
just ask it how does how to do that so

[07:17:49 - 07:17:53]
it gives me that there is a command it

[07:17:51 - 07:17:57]
tells me okay there's a command called

[07:17:53 - 07:17:58]
round you can just you know type what it

[07:17:57 - 07:18:00]
is there now it also gives me a

[07:17:58 - 07:18:02]
description of what it is now I don't

[07:18:00 - 07:18:05]
know what A1 is I don't know what zero

[07:18:02 - 07:18:07]
is A1 okay understand that it is the

[07:18:05 - 07:18:09]
cell reference it is the reference of

[07:18:07 - 07:18:11]
that particular cell now even refers to

[07:18:09 - 07:18:13]
the cell containing the number you want

[07:18:11 - 07:18:15]
to round the second argument zero

[07:18:13 - 07:18:18]
specifies that you want to round it to

[07:18:15 - 07:18:20]
zero decimal places effectively rounding

[07:18:18 - 07:18:22]
it to the nearest whole number right so

[07:18:20 - 07:18:23]
it gives me in a very crisp manner in a

[07:18:22 - 07:18:26]
very certain way that okay this is how

[07:18:23 - 07:18:28]
you do it you don't need to you know

[07:18:26 - 07:18:29]
bang your head around that okay how to

[07:18:28 - 07:18:31]
do it right you can get easy solutions

[07:18:29 - 07:18:34]
easy quick methods it's improving your

[07:18:31 - 07:18:36]
productivity right okay so now if I want

[07:18:34 - 07:18:38]
to round it off I'll just paste it over

[07:18:36 - 07:18:41]
here I'll just paste the formula that

[07:18:38 - 07:18:43]
charb provided me so it says equal to

[07:18:41 - 07:18:45]
round and the cell now A1 is definitely

[07:18:43 - 07:18:47]
not my cell it just gave me a dummy

[07:18:45 - 07:18:49]
number here so I'll just remove it and

[07:18:47 - 07:18:52]
I'll just space another cell let's just

[07:18:49 - 07:18:55]
say I want the the the rounding off for

[07:18:52 - 07:18:57]
K2 cell so I'll just click the cell K2

[07:18:55 - 07:19:00]
and I don't want any decimal places so

[07:18:57 - 07:19:01]
I'll just put enter right so I'll just

[07:19:00 - 07:19:03]
remove it I'll just place it here so

[07:19:01 - 07:19:05]
that it's convenient it's in the same

[07:19:03 - 07:19:07]
row so now it gives me the same thing

[07:19:05 - 07:19:09]
right so now if I want this to be

[07:19:07 - 07:19:13]
rounded off so what would I do I will

[07:19:09 - 07:19:16]
just drag these things

[07:19:13 - 07:19:20]
here so what would happen is it will

[07:19:16 - 07:19:23]
just apply all of these things just that

[07:19:20 - 07:19:25]
Excel has that kind of brain in which it

[07:19:23 - 07:19:28]
will utilize it for the row that you are

[07:19:25 - 07:19:32]
providing right so it will know in that

[07:19:28 - 07:19:35]
regard see so this is how it is there

[07:19:32 - 07:19:38]
now I have got another column right here

[07:19:35 - 07:19:42]
that would give me the rounding off of

[07:19:38 - 07:19:44]
that number so in the income statement

[07:19:42 - 07:19:47]
how P table or P chart will work I will

[07:19:44 - 07:19:50]
show you so first we need to select the

[07:19:47 - 07:19:53]
entire data okay after selecting the

[07:19:50 - 07:19:56]
data you need to go for insert here you

[07:19:53 - 07:19:59]
can see pivote table or recommended

[07:19:56 - 07:20:01]
pivote tables you go to pivote table

[07:19:59 - 07:20:03]
click on that so it will take

[07:20:01 - 07:20:05]
like select a table or range so whatever

[07:20:03 - 07:20:07]
the ranges you required you can select

[07:20:05 - 07:20:10]
that particular range or you can type

[07:20:07 - 07:20:12]
here also okay and use external data if

[07:20:10 - 07:20:15]
you want to use any external you can

[07:20:12 - 07:20:17]
choose here and new sheet or existing

[07:20:15 - 07:20:21]
worksheet so in this same sheet only you

[07:20:17 - 07:20:22]
can see what is a pivote table and how

[07:20:21 - 07:20:24]
the pivote chart looks like or in the

[07:20:22 - 07:20:27]
new worksheet also you can see so I

[07:20:24 - 07:20:30]
clicked on the new worksheet just click

[07:20:27 - 07:20:32]
on okay so there you can select which

[07:20:30 - 07:20:37]
which are all the values required for

[07:20:32 - 07:20:38]
example I required only 2019 2020 2021

[07:20:37 - 07:20:41]
okay all three years I have

[07:20:38 - 07:20:43]
selected this is your income statement

[07:20:41 - 07:20:46]
correct the total

[07:20:43 - 07:20:49]
revenues okay this is visible this is

[07:20:46 - 07:20:51]
your pivote table correct so next how to

[07:20:49 - 07:20:53]
create the pivote charts means after

[07:20:51 - 07:20:57]
creating the pivote table next you can

[07:20:53 - 07:20:59]
go here you will find the pivote chart

[07:20:57 - 07:21:01]
okay in the same column so just click on

[07:20:59 - 07:21:06]
pivote chart and here whichever you

[07:21:01 - 07:21:08]
required like candle border or whichever

[07:21:06 - 07:21:12]
you required or it is comfortable you

[07:21:08 - 07:21:14]
can select and click on okay see here

[07:21:12 - 07:21:20]
all the information all blue colors is

[07:21:14 - 07:21:23]
visible in so blue color is showing 2019

[07:21:20 - 07:21:25]
information orange color is 2020 and

[07:21:23 - 07:21:29]
this gray color is

[07:21:25 - 07:21:31]
20221 so if you want only 2019 and 20

[07:21:29 - 07:21:34]
not required 2021 so if you just click

[07:21:31 - 07:21:38]
on 21 that is untick then you can find

[07:21:34 - 07:21:41]
only 2019 and 2020 so if you required

[07:21:38 - 07:21:44]
only one year so 2019 and if you need to

[07:21:41 - 07:21:49]
compare with 2019 and 2021 so just click

[07:21:44 - 07:21:52]
on that and here also whatever you

[07:21:49 - 07:21:54]
want so here also values are there so

[07:21:52 - 07:21:56]
you can select that values draw and drop

[07:21:54 - 07:21:59]
here and here also revenues only

[07:21:56 - 07:22:01]
revenues we have taken we have any other

[07:21:59 - 07:22:05]
information you can draw can drop here

[07:22:01 - 07:22:07]
and the values okay that is also there

[07:22:05 - 07:22:10]
here only so with this P table and P

[07:22:07 - 07:22:15]
charts charts also we can easily analyze

[07:22:10 - 07:22:17]
the your financial statements so and if

[07:22:15 - 07:22:19]
you click on here the filter symbol is

and whichever you required like only

[07:22:22 - 07:22:27]
like first you can select all that is

[07:22:24 - 07:22:31]
untick then you can select only total

[07:22:27 - 07:22:31]
gains total expenses

[07:22:32 - 07:22:36]
total

[07:22:33 - 07:22:36]
losses and total

[07:22:37 - 07:22:43]
revenues so here in the 2019 2020 21 we

[07:22:41 - 07:22:46]
are comparing only these two years okay

[07:22:43 - 07:22:48]
what is the total expenses and what is

[07:22:46 - 07:22:51]
the total gain total losses and total

[07:22:48 - 07:22:54]
revenues so easily we can compare in the

[07:22:51 - 07:22:55]
pivote charts and if you want 2020 also

[07:22:54 - 07:22:59]
you can

[07:22:55 - 07:23:01]
just click on that you will get the

[07:22:59 - 07:23:03]
information so

[07:23:01 - 07:23:06]
if you comparatively total revenue and

[07:23:03 - 07:23:09]
total expenses so in 2021 only it is

[07:23:06 - 07:23:12]
highest the revenue is also High and the

[07:23:09 - 07:23:15]
expenses is also high so this is how we

[07:23:12 - 07:23:19]
need to use the pivote table and pivote

[07:23:15 - 07:23:21]
charts so if for example I know how to

[07:23:19 - 07:23:23]
create pivote table and pivote charts so

[07:23:21 - 07:23:25]
I can easily create if I'm not sure how

[07:23:23 - 07:23:28]
to create pivote table and P charts so

[07:23:25 - 07:23:30]
on that time also you can just ask the

[07:23:28 - 07:23:33]
chart GPT so that will give the

[07:23:30 - 07:23:35]
stepbystep process to create the pivote

[07:23:33 - 07:23:38]
table and pivote chart to analyze your

[07:23:35 - 07:23:41]
data it might be financial data or

[07:23:38 - 07:23:43]
whatever the data it may be so that will

[07:23:41 - 07:23:45]
clearly it will give you the

[07:23:43 - 07:23:48]
step-by-step information to create or

[07:23:45 - 07:23:49]
how to create the pivote table and

[07:23:48 - 07:23:52]
pivote

[07:23:49 - 07:23:54]
charts so first is your prepare your

[07:23:52 - 07:23:57]
data so already our data is prepared

[07:23:54 - 07:23:58]
correct next select the data range so

[07:23:57 - 07:24:00]
what I have done I have selected

[07:23:58 - 07:24:04]
complete income statement

[07:24:00 - 07:24:07]
correct so next insert a pivote table so

[07:24:04 - 07:24:11]
on the left side we have click on insert

[07:24:07 - 07:24:14]
pivote table next insert tab Excel P

[07:24:11 - 07:24:16]
table button choose the data source so

[07:24:14 - 07:24:19]
already selected that is which year you

[07:24:16 - 07:24:22]
required that is 2019 20 21 that we have

[07:24:19 - 07:24:25]
selected correct and data sources you

[07:24:22 - 07:24:29]
want Total expenditure or total loss or

[07:24:32 - 07:24:36]
the location location in the sense the

[07:24:34 - 07:24:39]
new sheet or existing

[07:24:36 - 07:24:42]
sheet so if you are going through this

[07:24:39 - 07:24:46]
step by step okay refresh the P table

[07:24:42 - 07:24:48]
analyze the data so after the table and

[07:24:46 - 07:24:52]
the graph is visible easily we can

[07:24:48 - 07:24:54]
analyze the data of that financial

[07:24:52 - 07:24:57]
statement okay so if you are not sure

[07:24:54 - 07:25:00]
then ask the CH GPT that will give the

[07:24:57 - 07:25:03]
in-depth step by-step activity to create

[07:25:00 - 07:25:05]
the or steps to create the pivote chart

[07:25:03 - 07:25:07]
and table so now let's look at the

[07:25:05 - 07:25:09]
various type of PowerPoint presentations

[07:25:07 - 07:25:11]
or the types of presentations are

[07:25:09 - 07:25:13]
present right so there are different

[07:25:11 - 07:25:16]
kinds of presentations so let's talk

[07:25:13 - 07:25:18]
about them so the presentations come in

[07:25:16 - 07:25:20]
in various formats and styles which are

[07:25:18 - 07:25:23]
cering to the different communication

[07:25:20 - 07:25:26]
needs and audience preferences now let's

[07:25:23 - 07:25:28]
look at some of the common types of of

[07:25:26 - 07:25:30]
presentation types right so the first

[07:25:28 - 07:25:33]
one is informative presentation so now

[07:25:30 - 07:25:35]
what this is about this is what you're

[07:25:33 - 07:25:37]
currently seeing right the the slides

[07:25:35 - 07:25:40]
that is there right so this slide is

[07:25:37 - 07:25:41]
basically what is the purpose is to

[07:25:40 - 07:25:44]
provide information to educate the

[07:25:41 - 07:25:46]
audience about a specific topic so I'm

[07:25:44 - 07:25:49]
talking about presentation this makes it

[07:25:46 - 07:25:51]
a informative presentation type right so

[07:25:49 - 07:25:52]
these presentations are content driven

[07:25:51 - 07:25:54]
right so this is a very important

[07:25:52 - 07:25:57]
keyword right here that this is content

[07:25:54 - 07:25:59]
driven and the focus is to explaining

[07:25:57 - 07:26:02]
the concepts and processes so if we look

[07:25:59 - 07:26:04]
about this current slide right I have a

[07:26:02 - 07:26:06]
header right right here so this is the

[07:26:04 - 07:26:09]
header we talk about so then we have the

[07:26:06 - 07:26:11]
content over here right the context is

[07:26:09 - 07:26:14]
defined over here so this makes it a

[07:26:11 - 07:26:17]
informative presentations in which it is

[07:26:14 - 07:26:19]
good to have a written text and it's

[07:26:17 - 07:26:21]
okay if there is no image so the purpose

[07:26:19 - 07:26:24]
is to make an audience understand a

[07:26:21 - 07:26:26]
particular concept right so for example

[07:26:24 - 07:26:29]
when I was explaining to you about the

[07:26:26 - 07:26:31]
various steps right I used something

[07:26:29 - 07:26:33]
known as a flow d diagram right so this

[07:26:31 - 07:26:35]
the purpose is to make them understand

[07:26:33 - 07:26:37]
so first what will happen is train

[07:26:35 - 07:26:39]
training GPD then splitting then

[07:26:37 - 07:26:42]
supervis so the way it is structured

[07:26:39 - 07:26:45]
right this is in a flow type of

[07:26:42 - 07:26:47]
information right so this is good for an

[07:26:45 - 07:26:49]
informative presentations

[07:26:47 - 07:26:52]
right then you have persuasive

[07:26:49 - 07:26:54]
presentations right maybe the goal here

[07:26:52 - 07:26:57]
is to persuade a group a set of set

[07:26:54 - 07:26:59]
group of audience right maybe to adopt a

[07:26:57 - 07:27:01]
particular Viewpoint right idea or a

[07:26:59 - 07:27:03]
course of action maybe in a business

[07:27:01 - 07:27:05]
setting in a business meeting when

[07:27:03 - 07:27:08]
someone is talking about let's say what

[07:27:05 - 07:27:10]
are the future prospects of of XYZ uh

[07:27:08 - 07:27:13]
commodity or XYZ things right so you

[07:27:10 - 07:27:15]
need to tell them why my idea is better

[07:27:13 - 07:27:18]
right so the goal of that presentation

[07:27:15 - 07:27:20]
is to persuade the audience right now

[07:27:18 - 07:27:22]
you would do anything to make them

[07:27:20 - 07:27:25]
believe that what you're doing is right

[07:27:22 - 07:27:28]
so the structure would be in such a way

[07:27:25 - 07:27:30]
that they adopt a particular Viewpoint

[07:27:28 - 07:27:33]
at the end of the presentation right

[07:27:30 - 07:27:35]
then is demonstration or product

[07:27:33 - 07:27:38]
presentation now what is this about this

[07:27:35 - 07:27:40]
is about for example if you are selling

[07:27:38 - 07:27:42]
mve let's say mve is a product right

[07:27:40 - 07:27:44]
you're selling mve so you're creating

[07:27:42 - 07:27:46]
slides you want to reach out a lot of

[07:27:44 - 07:27:48]
audience you're talking about that

[07:27:46 - 07:27:51]
particular product so how would that

[07:27:48 - 07:27:54]
show they that would be probably keeping

[07:27:51 - 07:27:56]
that product picture in the slide then

[07:27:54 - 07:27:58]
talking about that slide talking about

[07:27:56 - 07:28:00]
the various elements of that product so

[07:27:58 - 07:28:03]
that would be a a more related to a

[07:28:00 - 07:28:05]
product presentation right so these

[07:28:03 - 07:28:08]
presentation showcase a product or a

[07:28:05 - 07:28:10]
service the focus in is highlighting the

[07:28:08 - 07:28:12]
features benefits and value of offering

[07:28:10 - 07:28:14]
right so this is also very very

[07:28:12 - 07:28:16]
important type of presentation so

[07:28:14 - 07:28:18]
basically in a nutshell what you create

[07:28:16 - 07:28:20]
depends on what type of presentation it

[07:28:18 - 07:28:23]
is right so basically in a product

[07:28:20 - 07:28:26]
presentation you cannot create an

[07:28:23 - 07:28:28]
informative presentation in which you do

[07:28:26 - 07:28:29]
not have let's say any sort of images

[07:28:28 - 07:28:31]
and you're just describing the product

[07:28:29 - 07:28:32]
because because at the end the audience

[07:28:31 - 07:28:35]
have to visualize what you're talking

[07:28:32 - 07:28:37]
about right so in order to do that if it

[07:28:35 - 07:28:39]
is a product demonstration or a product

[07:28:37 - 07:28:42]
presentation then the product should be

[07:28:39 - 07:28:44]
the image of the product is the key to

[07:28:42 - 07:28:46]
make them understand or resonate what

[07:28:44 - 07:28:49]
you're talking about in a more efficient

[07:28:46 - 07:28:52]
manner so these presentation showcase

[07:28:49 - 07:28:54]
how a product or a service works right

[07:28:52 - 07:28:56]
so this is about demonstration or a

[07:28:54 - 07:28:58]
product presentation then then it is

[07:28:56 - 07:29:02]
conference and keynote presentations

[07:28:58 - 07:29:04]
right you might have been to let's say

[07:29:02 - 07:29:07]
research conference or let's say an

[07:29:04 - 07:29:10]
event in which you are a keynote speaker

[07:29:07 - 07:29:12]
so delivered in these conferences right

[07:29:10 - 07:29:15]
at large events keynote presentation set

[07:29:12 - 07:29:17]
the tone of the event and often featured

[07:29:15 - 07:29:19]
influential speakers sharing inside

[07:29:17 - 07:29:21]
Trends and thought-provoking ideas now

[07:29:19 - 07:29:24]
this type of presentation may include a

[07:29:21 - 07:29:26]
lot of flow diagrams a lot of you know

[07:29:24 - 07:29:28]
images because you're catering to a

[07:29:26 - 07:29:30]
large audience right let's say you're

[07:29:28 - 07:29:31]
you're presenting it in a large

[07:29:30 - 07:29:33]
Auditorium there there are hundreds of

[07:29:31 - 07:29:37]
people thousands of people sitting maybe

[07:29:33 - 07:29:40]
right so getting those fonts bigger for

[07:29:37 - 07:29:42]
them to see look at focus on right using

[07:29:40 - 07:29:45]
certain elements that are large certain

[07:29:42 - 07:29:47]
elements that are small the one that is

[07:29:45 - 07:29:49]
large would have a greater Chunk in

[07:29:47 - 07:29:52]
which you would be delivering to them so

[07:29:49 - 07:29:54]
the focus would be that aspect the part

[07:29:52 - 07:29:55]
in which the the text would be smaller

[07:29:54 - 07:29:59]
or the images would be smaller would

[07:29:55 - 07:30:01]
hold a significantly less amount of time

[07:29:59 - 07:30:04]
while presenting also the focus would be

[07:30:01 - 07:30:06]
a bit less then comes sales or pitch

[07:30:04 - 07:30:08]
presentations now what does this mean

[07:30:06 - 07:30:10]
now sales or pitch presentation is

[07:30:08 - 07:30:13]
basically designed to persuade the

[07:30:10 - 07:30:16]
potential customers or investors to buy

[07:30:13 - 07:30:18]
a product or invest in a project right

[07:30:16 - 07:30:20]
now these presentation emphasize the

[07:30:18 - 07:30:23]
value of proposition the market need and

[07:30:20 - 07:30:25]
the competitive advantage that it would

[07:30:23 - 07:30:27]
have right so this would be about the

[07:30:25 - 07:30:29]
sales pitch that is there then there's

[07:30:27 - 07:30:32]
something known as elevator pitch now

[07:30:29 - 07:30:35]
elevator pitch are considered to be a

[07:30:32 - 07:30:37]
very short pitch maybe in a slide or two

[07:30:35 - 07:30:41]
the aim is that it

[07:30:37 - 07:30:44]
should be as quick as you uh going from

[07:30:41 - 07:30:46]
ground floor to let's say 10th floor so

[07:30:44 - 07:30:47]
the amount of time you would take in an

[07:30:46 - 07:30:49]
elevator is equivalent to the time of

[07:30:47 - 07:30:51]
presentation you would have so this is

[07:30:49 - 07:30:54]
that's why it's known as elevator pitch

[07:30:51 - 07:30:55]
presentations so concise and compelling

[07:30:54 - 07:30:57]
presentations that can be delivered

[07:30:55 - 07:31:00]
within the time it takes to ride an

[07:30:57 - 07:31:03]
elevator it's used to introduce oneself

[07:31:00 - 07:31:05]
on a business idea very quickly so this

[07:31:03 - 07:31:08]
type of presentations would mainly let's

[07:31:05 - 07:31:11]
say have a title slide a big header

[07:31:08 - 07:31:13]
right there then maybe the second slide

[07:31:11 - 07:31:16]
is all about the infographics in which

[07:31:13 - 07:31:18]
you have a lot of flow diagrams lot of

[07:31:16 - 07:31:20]
charts something of that sort would be

[07:31:18 - 07:31:24]
in a much more greater depth but it

[07:31:20 - 07:31:28]
would not exceed one two Max not more

[07:31:24 - 07:31:31]
than that right so that would be the and

[07:31:28 - 07:31:35]
and the the best part about an elevator

[07:31:31 - 07:31:38]
pitches it would be heavy on content not

[07:31:35 - 07:31:40]
necessarily be be text more visual

[07:31:38 - 07:31:42]
content but it would not go more than

[07:31:40 - 07:31:45]
two slides that for sure this may be

[07:31:42 - 07:31:47]
filled up to a lot of Greater chunk

[07:31:45 - 07:31:49]
there would not be any space it may be

[07:31:47 - 07:31:52]
like a collage or or let's say a word

[07:31:49 - 07:31:55]
cloud sort of thing but it would not be

[07:31:52 - 07:31:56]
more than two slides that's for sure now

[07:31:55 - 07:31:58]
let's talk about what are the key

[07:31:56 - 07:31:59]
elements of our presentations we talked

[07:31:58 - 07:32:02]
about what the various types of

[07:31:59 - 07:32:05]
presentations but now let's take a dive

[07:32:02 - 07:32:07]
deep into what are the various elements

[07:32:05 - 07:32:09]
of a presentation right we talked about

[07:32:07 - 07:32:12]
the various types of presentations but

[07:32:09 - 07:32:14]
now let's focus on the element inside

[07:32:12 - 07:32:17]
the presentations what are the various

[07:32:14 - 07:32:19]
elements so uh the key elements include

[07:32:17 - 07:32:21]
number one is the title slide what is

[07:32:19 - 07:32:23]
the title slide I'll just show you in my

[07:32:21 - 07:32:27]
presentation itself something of this

[07:32:23 - 07:32:31]
sort right where the resemblance is a

[07:32:27 - 07:32:32]
big header right here a big header

[07:32:31 - 07:32:36]
then you would have something to

[07:32:32 - 07:32:39]
distinguish it right so this is the

[07:32:36 - 07:32:42]
format then you also have let's say a

[07:32:39 - 07:32:44]
template to the presentation right so

[07:32:42 - 07:32:47]
this slide would be the first slide of

[07:32:44 - 07:32:53]
the presentations which is known as a

[07:32:47 - 07:32:54]
title slide okay then so that's what we

[07:32:53 - 07:32:56]
talked about the title side the first

[07:32:54 - 07:32:59]
slide include presentation title your

[07:32:56 - 07:33:03]
name the date possibly the name of your

[07:32:59 - 07:33:05]
organization or institution right so the

[07:33:03 - 07:33:07]
second part is introduction now a brief

[07:33:05 - 07:33:10]
introduction slide that sets the context

[07:33:07 - 07:33:12]
for your presentation and outline what

[07:33:10 - 07:33:15]
you'll be covering right so it may have

[07:33:12 - 07:33:18]
a by line let's say that okay this topic

[07:33:15 - 07:33:21]
is about this the particular thing right

[07:33:18 - 07:33:23]
there will be a very short by line right

[07:33:21 - 07:33:25]
that outlines what you're covering it's

[07:33:23 - 07:33:27]
not necessarily popular in the current

[07:33:25 - 07:33:30]
scenario in which you just have a title

[07:33:27 - 07:33:32]
slide and then you move on to the agenda

[07:33:30 - 07:33:35]
right so agenda slide is a slide that

[07:33:32 - 07:33:37]
list the current main topics or the

[07:33:35 - 07:33:39]
sections of your presentation so that

[07:33:37 - 07:33:42]
the audience know what to expect right

[07:33:39 - 07:33:45]
for example I had as an agenda right I

[07:33:42 - 07:33:48]
had four pointers now this is my first

[07:33:45 - 07:33:51]
main pointer right first main pointer

[07:33:48 - 07:33:53]
this is my second main pointer this is

[07:33:51 - 07:33:56]
my third main pointer and this is my

[07:33:53 - 07:33:58]
fourth main pointer so what is this

[07:33:56 - 07:34:02]
required why is this required now this

[07:33:58 - 07:34:05]
pointer will act as a filler slide for

[07:34:02 - 07:34:07]
my upcoming modules let's say right so

[07:34:05 - 07:34:09]
this comes here now how do I distinguish

[07:34:07 - 07:34:12]
this this is a filler slide in which

[07:34:09 - 07:34:15]
just the topic is marked in the slide

[07:34:12 - 07:34:19]
you don't have a extra specifying border

[07:34:15 - 07:34:21]
to this you just have a a normal let's

[07:34:19 - 07:34:23]
say a normal text written on a slides

[07:34:21 - 07:34:24]
known as filler slides why is this

[07:34:23 - 07:34:27]
important distinguish number one from

[07:34:24 - 07:34:30]
the title slide because title slide has

[07:34:27 - 07:34:33]
a much more elevated much more trenic

[07:34:30 - 07:34:35]
much more clear idea of that this is the

[07:34:33 - 07:34:37]
title slide in this is just normal slide

[07:34:35 - 07:34:39]
in which the title is written so the

[07:34:37 - 07:34:41]
points of the agenda will act as a

[07:34:39 - 07:34:43]
filler slide or the module starters

[07:34:41 - 07:34:45]
right in a

[07:34:43 - 07:34:47]
presentation then you have uh let's say

[07:34:45 - 07:34:49]
uh various charts and graph visual

[07:34:47 - 07:34:52]
representations right now if it is a

[07:34:49 - 07:34:55]
sales pitch or if it is an elevator

[07:34:52 - 07:34:58]
pitch or if it's a let's say any sort of

[07:34:55 - 07:35:01]
uh keynote P the charts and graph play a

[07:34:58 - 07:35:03]
lot of role right if if you go ahead and

[07:35:01 - 07:35:06]
uh see a lot of TED Talks whatever the

[07:35:03 - 07:35:08]
presentations they present would either

[07:35:06 - 07:35:11]
have a graph or a visual representation

[07:35:08 - 07:35:13]
maybe a photo in the middle of the slide

[07:35:11 - 07:35:16]
right maybe a photo in the middle of the

[07:35:13 - 07:35:18]
slide and then you would have the story

[07:35:16 - 07:35:22]
done around that picture right this

[07:35:18 - 07:35:24]
would be the main element then or maybe

[07:35:22 - 07:35:26]
the case there would be if it is a very

[07:35:24 - 07:35:28]
technical sort of thing you would have

[07:35:26 - 07:35:31]
let's say a scatter plot made a line

[07:35:28 - 07:35:33]
plot or or bar graph or histogram then

[07:35:31 - 07:35:35]
you're talking about that in the entire

[07:35:33 - 07:35:36]
then you don't have much sort of text

[07:35:35 - 07:35:39]
you would have a graph you would label

[07:35:36 - 07:35:41]
the graph of course X Y what does this

[07:35:39 - 07:35:44]
represent what does this axis represent

[07:35:41 - 07:35:46]
and then you would talk around that part

[07:35:44 - 07:35:48]
in the presentations right use visual

[07:35:46 - 07:35:51]
representations of data to make the

[07:35:48 - 07:35:53]
complex information more digestable and

[07:35:51 - 07:35:54]
understandable right you don't want your

[07:35:53 - 07:35:57]
presentation to have lot of complex

[07:35:54 - 07:35:59]
jargons because then the attention of

[07:35:57 - 07:36:00]
the learner would go away they would

[07:35:59 - 07:36:02]
probably scroll their phones and not

[07:36:00 - 07:36:05]
look at your presentations but you don't

[07:36:02 - 07:36:07]
want that you would want them to be

[07:36:05 - 07:36:08]
hooked on to what you are speaking and

[07:36:07 - 07:36:12]
what you showcasing so it becomes really

[07:36:08 - 07:36:14]
important to start off with right then

[07:36:12 - 07:36:16]
transitions are very important right add

[07:36:14 - 07:36:19]
smooth transitions or animation so this

[07:36:16 - 07:36:22]
is usually done when it is sort of

[07:36:19 - 07:36:24]
either informal presentation or if it is

[07:36:22 - 07:36:27]
something that is not

[07:36:24 - 07:36:29]
very what do we call animations would be

[07:36:27 - 07:36:32]
something that transitions good

[07:36:29 - 07:36:34]
animations may make it a more informal

[07:36:32 - 07:36:37]
presentation right when you have lot of

[07:36:34 - 07:36:39]
let's say floating things coming on lot

[07:36:37 - 07:36:40]
of jumping things coming on right you

[07:36:39 - 07:36:43]
have those animations in the

[07:36:40 - 07:36:45]
presentation right smooth transitions is

[07:36:43 - 07:36:48]
when let's say you have a flowchart

[07:36:45 - 07:36:51]
right you have a flow process that is

[07:36:48 - 07:36:54]
defined so what would happen in a smooth

[07:36:51 - 07:36:55]
transition this would come first this

[07:36:54 - 07:36:58]
would be the second this would be third

[07:36:55 - 07:36:59]
so when you click next so only this will

[07:36:58 - 07:37:01]
be displayed then this this will be

[07:36:59 - 07:37:03]
displayed then this will be displayed in

[07:37:01 - 07:37:05]
a step-by-step manner so that is

[07:37:03 - 07:37:08]
something that is really formal you can

[07:37:05 - 07:37:10]
use that in any sort of settings but the

[07:37:08 - 07:37:13]
animations are a bit more informal

[07:37:10 - 07:37:15]
approach so try not using too much of

[07:37:13 - 07:37:17]
animations in your deck then it would be

[07:37:15 - 07:37:19]
more like creating a school level

[07:37:17 - 07:37:21]
presentation and not something that

[07:37:19 - 07:37:23]
would be a university or a or a

[07:37:21 - 07:37:25]
corporate sort of

[07:37:23 - 07:37:28]
presentations then is examples and case

[07:37:25 - 07:37:30]
studies so if applicable include real

[07:37:28 - 07:37:32]
world example or case study so one of

[07:37:30 - 07:37:34]
the best methods to engage your audience

[07:37:32 - 07:37:36]
one of the best methods to make your

[07:37:34 - 07:37:38]
audience appealed or hooked to your

[07:37:36 - 07:37:40]
presentation is through example and case

[07:37:38 - 07:37:42]
studies right people always remember

[07:37:40 - 07:37:45]
this people always resonate to the real

[07:37:42 - 07:37:47]
world examples and the real life case

[07:37:45 - 07:37:49]
studies that are there right because it

[07:37:47 - 07:37:52]
adds credibility to the presentation

[07:37:49 - 07:37:54]
which is very very important then also

[07:37:52 - 07:37:56]
you can use if it is something that is

[07:37:54 - 07:37:59]
motivational presentation add relevant

[07:37:56 - 07:38:01]
quotes you can add from experts or if

[07:37:59 - 07:38:03]
maybe maybe it's a sales pitch right if

[07:38:01 - 07:38:05]
you're talking about you know selling a

[07:38:03 - 07:38:07]
particular product then you can talk

[07:38:05 - 07:38:08]
about the actors that you have that are

[07:38:07 - 07:38:11]
there your brand ambassadors those who

[07:38:08 - 07:38:13]
have spoken about that particular

[07:38:11 - 07:38:15]
product you can add quotes if it is a

[07:38:13 - 07:38:18]
motivational sort you can add quotes

[07:38:15 - 07:38:20]
from various world leaders various

[07:38:18 - 07:38:23]
famous personalities and you can make

[07:38:20 - 07:38:25]
your presentations more desirable more

[07:38:23 - 07:38:27]
uh attrative more relevant to the

[07:38:25 - 07:38:30]
scenario so these are the various key

[07:38:27 - 07:38:34]
elements that are there also one of the

[07:38:30 - 07:38:37]
major aspects is to focus on the content

[07:38:34 - 07:38:39]
slides now content slides are the main

[07:38:37 - 07:38:41]
body right for example in an email you

[07:38:39 - 07:38:44]
have subject you have the header you

[07:38:41 - 07:38:46]
have the first by line of some sort you

[07:38:44 - 07:38:48]
have the main body text and then you

[07:38:46 - 07:38:51]
have the ending to the email similarly

[07:38:48 - 07:38:53]
in a presentation you have your opening

[07:38:51 - 07:38:55]
of the presentation you have the ending

[07:38:53 - 07:38:58]
the summary part but then in the middle

[07:38:55 - 07:39:00]
is what we call about the main body text

[07:38:58 - 07:39:02]
how would you end when you deep dive

[07:39:00 - 07:39:04]
into let's say technical Jons when you

[07:39:02 - 07:39:07]
talk about main context of the

[07:39:04 - 07:39:09]
presentations which is not too fancy so

[07:39:07 - 07:39:12]
that is when you have to be clear and

[07:39:09 - 07:39:14]
concise with your points now each slide

[07:39:12 - 07:39:17]
should have a single main point and idea

[07:39:14 - 07:39:20]
avoid clutter on the slides right don't

[07:39:17 - 07:39:23]
use a lot of pen while explaining that

[07:39:20 - 07:39:25]
may make your presentation uh not

[07:39:23 - 07:39:28]
desirable avoid clutter and keep text

[07:39:25 - 07:39:31]
concise then is use relevant images

[07:39:28 - 07:39:33]
charts graphs and diagrams to complement

[07:39:31 - 07:39:36]
your points and make your presentation

[07:39:33 - 07:39:38]
more engaging now bulleted list when

[07:39:36 - 07:39:41]
you're presenting key points use

[07:39:38 - 07:39:43]
bulleted list for easier readability

[07:39:41 - 07:39:45]
font and color ensure that the phont

[07:39:43 - 07:39:48]
size is large enough right now Fone also

[07:39:45 - 07:39:52]
plays a very critical role right if your

[07:39:48 - 07:39:55]
let's say if your header is of let's say

[07:39:52 - 07:39:59]
uh text style let's say 32 text F size

[07:39:55 - 07:40:02]
32 and your body is of text size 9 which

[07:39:59 - 07:40:05]
is also give a very you know bad feeling

[07:40:02 - 07:40:07]
when the header is too big and the the

[07:40:05 - 07:40:09]
content size the main body text is very

[07:40:07 - 07:40:10]
small that's also not good you have to

[07:40:09 - 07:40:13]
create a margin you have to make sure

[07:40:10 - 07:40:16]
that your header is clearly visible but

[07:40:13 - 07:40:18]
not overly visible that it disrupts the

[07:40:16 - 07:40:21]
audience from looking at the

[07:40:18 - 07:40:24]
presentation then uh the color right you

[07:40:21 - 07:40:27]
don't want to use you can use a lot of

[07:40:24 - 07:40:29]
bright colors to highlight specific

[07:40:27 - 07:40:32]
points but let's say let's assume that

[07:40:29 - 07:40:33]
if I were to make this entire thing red

[07:40:32 - 07:40:37]
right how would that feel that would not

[07:40:33 - 07:40:39]
be good right so let's say that if I

[07:40:37 - 07:40:42]
make this slide a very bright color

[07:40:39 - 07:40:45]
let's say if I put uh a very very bright

[07:40:42 - 07:40:48]
color indeed let's say red right it's

[07:40:45 - 07:40:50]
very not appealing right it's not

[07:40:48 - 07:40:53]
soothing it's like something written in

[07:40:50 - 07:40:57]
red which is also not good right if I

[07:40:53 - 07:40:59]
make it to to let's say uh very bright

[07:40:57 - 07:41:01]
color let's say yellow right I cannot

[07:40:59 - 07:41:04]
barely read anything right so it has to

[07:41:01 - 07:41:07]
have that readability it has to have

[07:41:04 - 07:41:09]
that you know sense of things P when you

[07:41:07 - 07:41:11]
have to do bold you have to focus on a

[07:41:09 - 07:41:14]
specific point then make that relevant

[07:41:11 - 07:41:16]
Point bold if not then leave it so

[07:41:14 - 07:41:19]
that's how you have to make your

[07:41:16 - 07:41:21]
presentations more engaging so in this

[07:41:19 - 07:41:24]
module let's talk about creating content

[07:41:21 - 07:41:27]
using Char gbt by content I mean the

[07:41:24 - 07:41:30]
slides let's create a presentation but

[07:41:27 - 07:41:33]
let's first look at the interface of

[07:41:30 - 07:41:36]
chat gbt let's look at how the dashboard

[07:41:33 - 07:41:39]
of chat gbt is let's have a handson on

[07:41:36 - 07:41:41]
that okay I'll open up search uh engine

[07:41:39 - 07:41:43]
right uh you can take Google Bing

[07:41:41 - 07:41:44]
anything that you write and then I will

[07:41:43 - 07:41:49]
type in

[07:41:44 - 07:41:52]
here right so I'll search for charge now

[07:41:49 - 07:41:54]
the first link that comes is charge by

[07:41:52 - 07:41:56]
open AI right we know it's made and

[07:41:54 - 07:41:59]
developed by open eyes we'll click on

[07:41:56 - 07:42:01]
that so now uh I have logged in into my

[07:41:59 - 07:42:03]
account

[07:42:01 - 07:42:06]
currently and uh

[07:42:03 - 07:42:09]
so I have logged in so let's look at a

[07:42:06 - 07:42:12]
brief view of what chat GPT is about so

[07:42:09 - 07:42:16]
what you get is two models Chad GPT 3.5

[07:42:12 - 07:42:19]
and GPT 4 so now what is the difference

[07:42:16 - 07:42:22]
basically chart GPD 3.5 is free for all

[07:42:19 - 07:42:25]
it is for anyone and everyone to use GPD

[07:42:22 - 07:42:28]
4 is a paid version of it right I have

[07:42:25 - 07:42:31]
bought the paid version so I have both

[07:42:28 - 07:42:32]
models gp4 and GPD 3.5 right so what

[07:42:31 - 07:42:35]
happens is what is the difference

[07:42:32 - 07:42:38]
between the two Let's uh look at this

[07:42:35 - 07:42:41]
I'll open open

[07:42:38 - 07:42:43]
eyes website so if I see open ai's

[07:42:41 - 07:42:45]
website I will come across a lot of

[07:42:43 - 07:42:48]
things right let's say if I want to look

[07:42:45 - 07:42:51]
at the two uh most famous products by

[07:42:48 - 07:42:55]
openi that is Char gbt 3.5 and four

[07:42:51 - 07:42:58]
right so now let's uh look at the model

[07:42:55 - 07:43:01]
GPT 4 that is the latest model by uh

[07:42:58 - 07:43:04]
open a so let's know how it is more

[07:43:01 - 07:43:06]
advanced right so gbd4 is an open AI is

[07:43:04 - 07:43:09]
most advanced system uh which gives much

[07:43:06 - 07:43:11]
more uh logically correct logically

[07:43:09 - 07:43:14]
sound results than its previous model

[07:43:11 - 07:43:17]
that is GPD 3.5 so now what has happened

[07:43:14 - 07:43:20]
in in gbd4 the neural engine is of much

[07:43:17 - 07:43:22]
higher accuracy it has much more

[07:43:20 - 07:43:25]
understanding and problem solving

[07:43:22 - 07:43:27]
abilities than its predecessor so it has

[07:43:25 - 07:43:30]
much more logical reasoning aspect to it

[07:43:27 - 07:43:32]
so if you add a lot of heavy uh let's

[07:43:30 - 07:43:35]
say logical reasoning questions it is

[07:43:32 - 07:43:38]
much more suited to solve it than its

[07:43:35 - 07:43:42]
predecessor 3.5 right however the speed

[07:43:38 - 07:43:45]
of GPD 4 is slightly slower because it

[07:43:42 - 07:43:47]
has much more uh problems in the back

[07:43:45 - 07:43:49]
end the algorithm is is in such a way

[07:43:47 - 07:43:52]
that it takes more time to give your

[07:43:49 - 07:43:56]
results but the the accuracy is much

[07:43:52 - 07:43:59]
more in gp4 than in gbd 3.5 right so uh

[07:43:56 - 07:44:01]
now let's see uh gbd4 is more creative

[07:43:59 - 07:44:03]
ative collaborative than ever before it

[07:44:01 - 07:44:05]
can generate edit and iterate with the

[07:44:03 - 07:44:08]
uses on creative and technical writing

[07:44:05 - 07:44:10]
tasks such as composing songs writing

[07:44:08 - 07:44:14]
screenplays or learning a users writing

[07:44:10 - 07:44:18]
sky so for example if I give gbd4 that

[07:44:14 - 07:44:22]
write a poem on on let's say any topic

[07:44:18 - 07:44:24]
but every word in that poem should start

[07:44:22 - 07:44:27]
with the letter M so it will give me

[07:44:24 - 07:44:29]
that result it will make a poem it will

[07:44:27 - 07:44:32]
generate a poem from scratch which is is

[07:44:29 - 07:44:34]
not by the way copied from anywhere but

[07:44:32 - 07:44:36]
it will create a new poem for me which

[07:44:34 - 07:44:39]
would start which would have all the

[07:44:36 - 07:44:43]
words that starts with the letter

[07:44:39 - 07:44:44]
M now gbd4 uh surpasses gbd3 in the

[07:44:43 - 07:44:48]
advanced reasoning capabilities they

[07:44:44 - 07:44:52]
have given the input how gbd 3.5 that is

[07:44:48 - 07:44:56]
charb is different from gbd4 right so in

[07:44:52 - 07:44:59]
the percentile rankings right so 90th

[07:44:56 - 07:45:01]
percentile right that's a that's like

[07:44:59 - 07:45:04]
top 1% of the class right that is the

[07:45:01 - 07:45:07]
result that gbt 4 got when it gave these

[07:45:04 - 07:45:10]
exams right when it was run the exams

[07:45:07 - 07:45:12]
were run through these so it gave 90th

[07:45:10 - 07:45:16]
percentile that is basically Olympiad

[07:45:12 - 07:45:19]
level things right top 1% right right in

[07:45:16 - 07:45:22]
biology Olympiad it is 99th percentile

[07:45:19 - 07:45:24]
that's basically a Topper right so

[07:45:22 - 07:45:27]
that's how Advance it has become right

[07:45:24 - 07:45:29]
compared to its previous models so it is

[07:45:27 - 07:45:31]
ongoing the research is ongoing opening

[07:45:29 - 07:45:34]
is still developing these models right

[07:45:31 - 07:45:37]
but as it mentions right that gbd4 is

[07:45:34 - 07:45:40]
82% less likely to respond to request

[07:45:37 - 07:45:43]
that this allowed content and 40% more

[07:45:40 - 07:45:45]
likely to produce factual responses

[07:45:43 - 07:45:47]
right more factual accuracy than its

[07:45:45 - 07:45:49]
predecessors so that's why gbd4 is

[07:45:47 - 07:45:52]
really really popular but it is

[07:45:49 - 07:45:55]
currently paid both the models are good

[07:45:52 - 07:45:58]
but gbd4 is a much better model in terms

[07:45:55 - 07:45:59]
of response and everything right so uh

[07:45:58 - 07:46:02]
now coming back back to the topic here's

[07:45:59 - 07:46:04]
a quick dashboard on it you can write

[07:46:02 - 07:46:05]
your prompts in this message box here in

[07:46:04 - 07:46:08]
which you can write your prompts then

[07:46:05 - 07:46:10]
you can send your prompts whatever it is

[07:46:08 - 07:46:12]
right and uh this is basically the

[07:46:10 - 07:46:14]
threads right the threads whatever the

[07:46:12 - 07:46:18]
threads are there that would be in this

[07:46:14 - 07:46:20]
black section right here right so you

[07:46:18 - 07:46:22]
can add new chart from here you can

[07:46:20 - 07:46:25]
close this sidebar when you

[07:46:22 - 07:46:28]
are you know uh asking or writing your

[07:46:25 - 07:46:30]
prompts of particular topics you can

[07:46:28 - 07:46:34]
minimize that one right so one thing is

[07:46:30 - 07:46:36]
that uh chat GPT right uh this has

[07:46:34 - 07:46:39]
learned and

[07:46:36 - 07:46:43]
trained the data right whatever it has

[07:46:39 - 07:46:46]
trained is up to 2021 September 2021 so

[07:46:43 - 07:46:48]
anything that is after that it does not

[07:46:46 - 07:46:53]
know if I ask him what is the date today

[07:46:48 - 07:47:00]
right or maybe if I ask him what is to

[07:46:53 - 07:47:00]
days breaking news across the world

[07:47:01 - 07:47:06]
right it would not give you because it

[07:47:03 - 07:47:07]
will write here I apologize that I do

[07:47:06 - 07:47:10]
not have real time capabilities my

[07:47:07 - 07:47:12]
knowledge extends up to September 2021

[07:47:10 - 07:47:15]
so it will give you directly that okay I

[07:47:12 - 07:47:16]
have not been trained to you know talk

[07:47:15 - 07:47:19]
about what is happening in the world

[07:47:16 - 07:47:22]
currently because my knowledge is up to

[07:47:19 - 07:47:24]
date up 2021 right so that's one

[07:47:22 - 07:47:27]
disadvantage that's one drawback that

[07:47:24 - 07:47:29]
chat gbt has that it's not aware about

[07:47:27 - 07:47:30]
the current things that that are

[07:47:29 - 07:47:33]
happening right if there is any change

[07:47:30 - 07:47:35]
in certain things it would not know

[07:47:33 - 07:47:37]
right but on the other hand now I can

[07:47:35 - 07:47:40]
tell it I can copy paste this if I want

[07:47:37 - 07:47:42]
from here I can so this is for their own

[07:47:40 - 07:47:44]
backend understanding that whether this

[07:47:42 - 07:47:46]
was good so if it was good then they

[07:47:44 - 07:47:49]
would have a parameter this is giving

[07:47:46 - 07:47:51]
good result if not then I could I could

[07:47:49 - 07:47:53]
put the thumbs on one right then it

[07:47:51 - 07:47:55]
would know what are the you know giving

[07:47:53 - 07:47:56]
them the feedback that this was not

[07:47:55 - 07:47:59]
helpful this isn't true so you can give

[07:47:56 - 07:48:01]
the it'll learn on that one right So

[07:47:59 - 07:48:04]
currently since I use 3.5 so it

[07:48:01 - 07:48:07]
showcases me that it's default model 3.5

[07:48:04 - 07:48:09]
now coming back to our topic in which uh

[07:48:07 - 07:48:11]
we were talking about how to create a

[07:48:09 - 07:48:14]
presentation how to create slides using

[07:48:11 - 07:48:16]
chart GPT right so in this scenario in

[07:48:14 - 07:48:18]
this context like let's start off by

[07:48:16 - 07:48:20]
taking another random topic let's say

[07:48:18 - 07:48:23]
let's take climate change for that

[07:48:20 - 07:48:26]
matter now I will put certain prompts

[07:48:23 - 07:48:29]
and create an entire deck how I like how

[07:48:26 - 07:48:32]
I want the deck to be using chart GPT

[07:48:29 - 07:48:36]
right so for uh better results let's

[07:48:32 - 07:48:40]
just take GPT 4 model and let's

[07:48:36 - 07:48:43]
just uh type in our our prompts here

[07:48:40 - 07:48:45]
right so my first prompt would be quite

[07:48:43 - 07:48:47]
generic I would not add too many details

[07:48:45 - 07:48:49]
in it but when you're talking about gbt

[07:48:47 - 07:48:51]
4 model if you give them various

[07:48:49 - 07:48:53]
parameters then it is much more helpful

[07:48:51 - 07:48:55]
otherwise gbt 3.5 and four would be the

[07:48:53 - 07:48:58]
same so if you have a lot of parameters

[07:48:55 - 07:49:00]
let's say uh climate um when I talk

[07:48:58 - 07:49:02]
about climate chains or the topic about

[07:49:00 - 07:49:04]
climate so I would have if I want to

[07:49:02 - 07:49:06]
input a lot of parameters in it you know

[07:49:04 - 07:49:09]
talk about the audience in let's say

[07:49:06 - 07:49:12]
Asia Pacific region know about what is

[07:49:09 - 07:49:15]
happening historical data on how the

[07:49:12 - 07:49:17]
global warming has uh has started or or

[07:49:15 - 07:49:19]
is on the rise what what are the various

[07:49:17 - 07:49:21]
greenhouse gases so all that if I have

[07:49:19 - 07:49:23]
to talk about I can give them the

[07:49:21 - 07:49:24]
parameters to talk about right so all

[07:49:23 - 07:49:28]
that we'll see let's get into it let's

[07:49:24 - 07:49:33]
dive deep into it so let's just type in

[07:49:28 - 07:49:36]
first what should I name right let's say

[07:49:33 - 07:49:39]
um if I have to

[07:49:36 - 07:49:41]
create a let's

[07:49:39 - 07:49:44]
say

[07:49:41 - 07:49:46]
PPT on the

[07:49:44 - 07:49:50]
topic climate

[07:49:46 - 07:49:52]
change could you suggest

[07:49:50 - 07:49:54]
me some

[07:49:52 - 07:50:01]
catchy

[07:49:54 - 07:50:03]
titles for my PPT right so let's just

[07:50:01 - 07:50:04]
type in let's just see what it gives me

[07:50:03 - 07:50:07]
right now I've given that I have to

[07:50:04 - 07:50:09]
create a PP on the topic climate change

[07:50:07 - 07:50:13]
could you suggest some catchy titles for

[07:50:09 - 07:50:16]
my PPT right now uh it will give me a

[07:50:13 - 07:50:17]
list of of answers right it will not

[07:50:16 - 07:50:21]
give me one or two answers it will give

[07:50:17 - 07:50:24]
me a list a good chunk of more than 20

[07:50:21 - 07:50:26]
or 20 results right and I can pick from

[07:50:24 - 07:50:28]
there right Earth is a Tipping Point

[07:50:26 - 07:50:32]
understanding climate change unraveling

[07:50:28 - 07:50:34]
the climate for nandrum the heat is on

[07:50:32 - 07:50:36]
decoding climate change so all this is

[07:50:34 - 07:50:39]
given now I can choose right let's just

[07:50:36 - 07:50:41]
take any uh random thing right uh let's

[07:50:39 - 07:50:41]
just

[07:50:44 - 07:50:49]
say

[07:50:45 - 07:50:49]
um let's just

[07:50:51 - 07:50:59]
take I just take this one right right

[07:50:54 - 07:50:59]
there Earth is at the Tipping Point

[07:51:01 - 07:51:07]
now if I want to

[07:51:03 - 07:51:10]
create can you create uh let's say I

[07:51:07 - 07:51:15]
want to create a by line right by

[07:51:10 - 07:51:15]
line for this

[07:51:19 - 07:51:24]
title you know so also right if I do not

[07:51:22 - 07:51:26]
know I have just heard the term by line

[07:51:24 - 07:51:28]
and and I do not know what by line

[07:51:26 - 07:51:30]
actually is right so what would happen

[07:51:28 - 07:51:34]
is that I it would just give certainty

[07:51:30 - 07:51:36]
diine can help provide a little more

[07:51:34 - 07:51:38]
context or highlight the unique

[07:51:36 - 07:51:41]
perspective of your presentations right

[07:51:38 - 07:51:43]
so decoding Earth's Rising temperatures

[07:51:41 - 07:51:45]
and the fight for survival and then so

[07:51:43 - 07:51:48]
it basically gives me a by line as well

[07:51:45 - 07:51:52]
now what I have to do is I have to ask

[07:51:48 - 07:51:55]
Char gbt to give me an entire slides how

[07:51:52 - 07:51:58]
much is the amount I will specify but to

[07:51:55 - 07:52:00]
create an entire deck out of it a slight

[07:51:58 - 07:52:05]
deck out of it right so let's just do

[07:52:00 - 07:52:09]
that so now I will talk about create a

[07:52:05 - 07:52:13]
slide create a slide

[07:52:09 - 07:52:15]
deck of uh let's say 14

[07:52:13 - 07:52:17]
slides

[07:52:15 - 07:52:19]
highlighting I'll just first give a

[07:52:17 - 07:52:25]
random dump

[07:52:19 - 07:52:27]
about climate change right so I'm just

[07:52:25 - 07:52:31]
giving it that create a slide de 14

[07:52:27 - 07:52:33]
slides about CL now make sure that the

[07:52:31 - 07:52:35]
context here is that you do not have

[07:52:33 - 07:52:37]
time to make the presentation let's just

[07:52:35 - 07:52:39]
say that you have to make a presentation

[07:52:37 - 07:52:41]
next day or the day after and you're

[07:52:39 - 07:52:43]
running low on time so what would you do

[07:52:41 - 07:52:47]
you would make use of CH gbd so that's

[07:52:43 - 07:52:49]
all this is about right so now this uh

[07:52:47 - 07:52:52]
let's see the result now here's the

[07:52:49 - 07:52:54]
proposed structure for your 14th slide

[07:52:52 - 07:52:57]
PowerPoint presentation now slide number

[07:52:54 - 07:52:59]
one is about title slide so I have

[07:52:57 - 07:53:02]
already chosen Earth at the Tipping

[07:52:59 - 07:53:04]
Point understanding climate change now

[07:53:02 - 07:53:06]
this is the beauty of charb it

[07:53:04 - 07:53:09]
understands what you have asked Char GPT

[07:53:06 - 07:53:11]
before in the same thread right if I'm

[07:53:09 - 07:53:13]
talking in the same thread right this is

[07:53:11 - 07:53:17]
the new chart in the same chart if I'm

[07:53:13 - 07:53:18]
talking to chart GPT right it will

[07:53:17 - 07:53:20]
understand what I have spoken before it

[07:53:18 - 07:53:23]
will understand what I have I have input

[07:53:20 - 07:53:26]
before right it have that memory in the

[07:53:23 - 07:53:29]
same thread right so now it understands

[07:53:26 - 07:53:30]
that my title that I electri is Earth at

[07:53:29 - 07:53:34]
the Tipping Point understanding climate

[07:53:30 - 07:53:36]
change right in two prompts before I I I

[07:53:34 - 07:53:38]
did this one right so I I chose it

[07:53:36 - 07:53:41]
understood that from this entire dump I

[07:53:38 - 07:53:44]
have chosen this part right and it gives

[07:53:41 - 07:53:46]
me after two prompts it gives me the

[07:53:44 - 07:53:49]
same thing right the title slide title

[07:53:46 - 07:53:51]
is this subtitle of this is decoding

[07:53:49 - 07:53:53]
Earth's riding and fight for survival

[07:53:51 - 07:53:55]
right so it gives me the first one here

[07:53:53 - 07:53:57]
because I did not really specify it if I

[07:53:55 - 07:54:01]
would have it would have given me the

[07:53:57 - 07:54:03]
the one that I wanted right now it says

[07:54:01 - 07:54:05]
that my slide one should be the title

[07:54:03 - 07:54:07]
slide this is I explained it in the key

[07:54:05 - 07:54:09]
elements the first slide is always the

[07:54:07 - 07:54:11]
title slide then is the introduction a

[07:54:09 - 07:54:14]
brief introduction about climate change

[07:54:11 - 07:54:15]
its causes why it's important to

[07:54:14 - 07:54:17]
understand and address it right then

[07:54:15 - 07:54:20]
defining climate change this all this

[07:54:17 - 07:54:23]
now if I'm not happy with this right if

[07:54:20 - 07:54:26]
I'm not happy how it has you know given

[07:54:23 - 07:54:28]
me the things I can ask it to make it

[07:54:26 - 07:54:30]
better right so now what I'll do is I'll

[07:54:28 - 07:54:32]
ask slide number two that is

[07:54:30 - 07:54:34]
Introduction right so I'll copy paste

[07:54:32 - 07:54:37]
this right

[07:54:34 - 07:54:43]
here and I'll paste The Prompt below and

[07:54:37 - 07:54:43]
what will I do I will just write add

[07:54:45 - 07:54:51]
elaborate this point now I have to think

[07:54:49 - 07:54:53]
in this perspective if it is an

[07:54:51 - 07:54:55]
introduction slide how many pointers do

[07:54:53 - 07:54:58]
I need right do I need to add images or

[07:54:55 - 07:55:00]
do I need to add more text right so

[07:54:58 - 07:55:01]
elaborate this let's say I find let

[07:55:00 - 07:55:05]
let's say four more points should be

[07:55:01 - 07:55:05]
there more four

[07:55:06 - 07:55:09]
valuable

[07:55:10 - 07:55:16]
points points elaborate this point in

[07:55:13 - 07:55:20]
four valuable points and

[07:55:16 - 07:55:26]
add a case

[07:55:20 - 07:55:28]
study example from history

[07:55:26 - 07:55:31]
right history

[07:55:28 - 07:55:34]
okay so now I'll give it this problem

[07:55:31 - 07:55:36]
let's see what the result is so slide

[07:55:34 - 07:55:38]
number two right a brief introduction

[07:55:36 - 07:55:40]
about elaborate this point in four

[07:55:38 - 07:55:43]
valuable points now it will give me the

[07:55:40 - 07:55:45]
dump that okay this is the thing what

[07:55:43 - 07:55:48]
what is climate change climate change

[07:55:45 - 07:55:50]
refers to a long shift in temperatures

[07:55:48 - 07:55:53]
and weather patterns particularly a rise

[07:55:50 - 07:55:55]
in global temperatures right case study

[07:55:53 - 07:55:58]
the little ice age a period fooling from

[07:55:55 - 07:56:00]
The 14th Century to the mid 19th century

[07:55:58 - 07:56:02]
illustrates the natural climate

[07:56:00 - 07:56:05]
variability during this period

[07:56:02 - 07:56:06]
temperatures dropped by only about 1%

[07:56:05 - 07:56:09]
but it was enough to freeze the river

[07:56:06 - 07:56:13]
themes in in London causing widespread

[07:56:09 - 07:56:15]
crop failures right so I asked him to I

[07:56:13 - 07:56:17]
asked the chart GPT model to give me

[07:56:15 - 07:56:20]
four valuable points and add a case

[07:56:17 - 07:56:23]
study right example now I wanted to add

[07:56:20 - 07:56:26]
a case study right but what it did is it

[07:56:23 - 07:56:28]
added a case study in each pointer right

[07:56:26 - 07:56:33]
which is what I did not want

[07:56:28 - 07:56:35]
right so I'll write here just give me

[07:56:33 - 07:56:40]
one case

[07:56:35 - 07:56:40]
study in the above

[07:56:42 - 07:56:47]
answer in the above answer and just give

[07:56:45 - 07:56:49]
me one case study in the above answer

[07:56:47 - 07:56:51]
and

[07:56:49 - 07:56:56]
keep the

[07:56:51 - 07:56:59]
pointers up to one

[07:56:56 - 07:57:02]
line let's make it two lines

[07:56:59 - 07:57:05]
two

[07:57:02 - 07:57:08]
okay now let's see if it understands or

[07:57:05 - 07:57:10]
not right yeah so it it gave me the

[07:57:08 - 07:57:12]
thing understanding climate change the

[07:57:10 - 07:57:15]
causes in I I asked it to give it in two

[07:57:12 - 07:57:17]
lines it gave me to into two lines and

[07:57:15 - 07:57:19]
then I asked one case study right one

[07:57:17 - 07:57:21]
just give me one case study so now it

[07:57:19 - 07:57:24]
gives me one case study that the dust

[07:57:21 - 07:57:27]
ball of 1930s in in United States is an

[07:57:24 - 07:57:29]
example of a climate event by human

[07:57:27 - 07:57:31]
activity poor farming practices like to

[07:57:29 - 07:57:34]
white Switch soil erosion and dust

[07:57:31 - 07:57:36]
storms creating a decade long drought

[07:57:34 - 07:57:38]
although not uh direct parall to today's

[07:57:36 - 07:57:40]
Global issue that has demonstrate how

[07:57:38 - 07:57:42]
human actions can dramatically affect

[07:57:40 - 07:57:44]
crime now this is something now if I

[07:57:42 - 07:57:47]
have to verify this I can go and I can

[07:57:44 - 07:57:49]
write it in Google and see if this is

[07:57:47 - 07:57:52]
accurate or not which we should do any

[07:57:49 - 07:57:57]
content that you put or go forward from

[07:57:52 - 07:57:59]
adding from charb it needs to be much

[07:57:57 - 07:58:00]
more clear here number one in terms of

[07:57:59 - 07:58:02]
the facts if they are wrong you need to

[07:58:00 - 07:58:05]
cross verify it right if you have any

[07:58:02 - 07:58:08]
doubt cross verify it because charity is

[07:58:05 - 07:58:10]
accurate up to some level but you need

[07:58:08 - 07:58:13]
to make you need to cross check because

[07:58:10 - 07:58:14]
it may be wrong at times it's not fully

[07:58:13 - 07:58:17]
up to the point in which there are no

[07:58:14 - 07:58:18]
errors there are errors there are things

[07:58:17 - 07:58:21]
that are factually incorrect so you need

[07:58:18 - 07:58:23]
to also check that point as well but

[07:58:21 - 07:58:25]
since climate change is a very generic

[07:58:23 - 07:58:28]
Topic in which you don't need to address

[07:58:25 - 07:58:31]
a lot of uh you know technical terms

[07:58:28 - 07:58:35]
so this becomes much more easier for for

[07:58:31 - 07:58:36]
making a presentation for sure so

[07:58:35 - 07:58:38]
understanding the climate change the

[07:58:36 - 07:58:39]
causes the need to addresses the

[07:58:38 - 07:58:42]
importance awareness right so now I have

[07:58:39 - 07:58:45]
four headers in these things right okay

[07:58:42 - 07:58:49]
let's now talk about uh how to add these

[07:58:45 - 07:58:51]
slides in PowerPoint presentation so

[07:58:49 - 07:58:55]
what I'll do is uh what I have got here

[07:58:51 - 07:58:58]
right now I want to elaborate it right

[07:58:55 - 07:59:00]
so I'll just write I'll just rechange it

[07:58:58 - 07:59:03]
so there's this option here where you

[07:59:00 - 07:59:07]
can modify the current prompt right so

[07:59:03 - 07:59:09]
I'll add uh shift enter then I'll add

[07:59:07 - 07:59:14]
add

[07:59:09 - 07:59:16]
four let's say Five Short

[07:59:14 - 07:59:18]
pointers in

[07:59:16 - 07:59:20]
each

[07:59:18 - 07:59:22]
section

[07:59:20 - 07:59:26]
okay in

[07:59:22 - 07:59:30]
each section short crisp let's add the

[07:59:26 - 07:59:30]
word crisp pointers

[07:59:32 - 07:59:39]
see Cris pointers in section so let's

[07:59:36 - 07:59:43]
see what the result is so now what

[07:59:39 - 07:59:45]
happens is it would give me an iteration

[07:59:43 - 07:59:47]
right it would give me okay so this was

[07:59:45 - 07:59:50]
my first iteration this is my second

[07:59:47 - 07:59:52]
iteration so it will give me from now it

[07:59:50 - 07:59:55]
understands that title slides cannot

[07:59:52 - 07:59:57]
have a four point pointer thing so it

[07:59:55 - 07:59:59]
will not give me those kind of four

[07:59:57 - 08:00:01]
pointers right

[07:59:59 - 08:00:04]
now this gives me a lot more pointers

[08:00:01 - 08:00:07]
I've asked for four pointers it's giving

[08:00:04 - 08:00:10]
me five pointers that is there now I

[08:00:07 - 08:00:14]
want to add this in in my PPT let's say

[08:00:10 - 08:00:14]
so I'll just go to I'll create a

[08:00:15 - 08:00:19]
new right so what I'll do is I'll

[08:00:18 - 08:00:23]
refresh

[08:00:19 - 08:00:26]
this and I'll I'll click on the right

[08:00:23 - 08:00:28]
button then I'll create a Microsoft

[08:00:26 - 08:00:32]
PowerPoint presentations right I'll name

[08:00:28 - 08:00:32]
it as climate

[08:00:32 - 08:00:38]
change climate change right I'll double

[08:00:36 - 08:00:41]
click it I'll open it now this is what

[08:00:38 - 08:00:44]
comes up it's the PowerPoint that opens

[08:00:41 - 08:00:46]
up now I want to add a new slide right

[08:00:44 - 08:00:50]
so can I can create a title slide that

[08:00:46 - 08:00:52]
is right there then I can add H

[08:00:50 - 08:00:55]
subsequent slides right then I need

[08:00:52 - 08:00:58]
Title and content then I can have much

[08:00:55 - 08:01:00]
more like this so slide number number

[08:00:58 - 08:01:02]
one let's see what what it has given me

[08:01:00 - 08:01:04]
right so it has given me first is the

[08:01:02 - 08:01:07]
title slide is Earth at the Tipping

[08:01:04 - 08:01:09]
Point of climate change so I'll I'll

[08:01:07 - 08:01:13]
click on this I'll copy paste

[08:01:09 - 08:01:16]
this then I

[08:01:13 - 08:01:20]
will add this here

[08:01:16 - 08:01:25]
right climate Earth at the Tipping Point

[08:01:20 - 08:01:26]
right at this so this is currently at 54

[08:01:25 - 08:01:30]
let's just move it to

[08:01:26 - 08:01:35]
42 and let's just change this to let's

[08:01:30 - 08:01:37]
say calib and I can bold it and I'll

[08:01:35 - 08:01:40]
bold it now if I want to add a subline

[08:01:37 - 08:01:44]
by line right that can also be done

[08:01:40 - 08:01:48]
decoding us Rising temperature

[08:01:44 - 08:01:53]
and and this I can right so this is

[08:01:48 - 08:01:54]
generally in a lesser known in a let's

[08:01:53 - 08:01:58]
say

[08:01:54 - 08:02:01]
a bit more smaller than the previous so

[08:01:58 - 08:02:04]
I kept this one as 42 this one I'll keep

[08:02:01 - 08:02:08]
as 24 or 24 is is fine so I'll keep this

[08:02:04 - 08:02:11]
as 24 now uh this is my title slide

[08:02:08 - 08:02:13]
right there right so this one is sorted

[08:02:11 - 08:02:14]
now the second one is adding the content

[08:02:13 - 08:02:17]
the second one is about introduction

[08:02:14 - 08:02:22]
right introduction I will either type or

[08:02:17 - 08:02:24]
I'll just copy paste it introduction to

[08:02:22 - 08:02:27]
and just say climate

[08:02:24 - 08:02:30]
change okay so it comes up in board

[08:02:27 - 08:02:31]
automatically at 44 but I'll reduce it

[08:02:30 - 08:02:34]
to

[08:02:31 - 08:02:37]
32 right 36 let's just take it okay have

[08:02:34 - 08:02:41]
to select all I'll just give the number

[08:02:37 - 08:02:44]
36 okay and I bold it's already bold it

[08:02:41 - 08:02:46]
is perfect right then I can add the

[08:02:44 - 08:02:48]
content straight away from what it has

[08:02:46 - 08:02:48]
given

[08:02:49 - 08:02:56]
me right definitions brief explanation

[08:02:53 - 08:02:58]
introduction and everything right so now

[08:02:56 - 08:03:00]
if I want to add another slide I'm not

[08:02:58 - 08:03:07]
happy with the flow right historical

[08:03:00 - 08:03:09]
overview I'll just click on this then

[08:03:07 - 08:03:12]
I'll okay so it has given me this

[08:03:09 - 08:03:14]
response but I think I want to let's say

[08:03:12 - 08:03:16]
I want to have in third slide

[08:03:14 - 08:03:19]
introduction I'll just

[08:03:16 - 08:03:21]
uh have copy ped definition of climate

[08:03:19 - 08:03:23]
change re introduction right so now

[08:03:21 - 08:03:25]
these are my main pointers right but I

[08:03:23 - 08:03:29]
can't really write definition of climate

[08:03:25 - 08:03:29]
change right so what I'll do is right

[08:03:33 - 08:03:37]
elaborate

[08:03:35 - 08:03:41]
on slide

[08:03:37 - 08:03:41]
two and

[08:03:42 - 08:03:47]
chis

[08:03:44 - 08:03:49]
pointer right so now it'll go back and

[08:03:47 - 08:03:51]
it'll think what this is about now

[08:03:49 - 08:03:54]
climate change reference it has given me

[08:03:51 - 08:03:56]
that it refers to the temperature

[08:03:54 - 08:03:58]
something yeah wether patterns and

[08:03:56 - 08:04:00]
temperatures it includes both global

[08:03:58 - 08:04:03]
warming driven by human induced

[08:04:00 - 08:04:05]
emissions of green gases and the

[08:04:03 - 08:04:08]
resulting so what I'll do is I'll just C

[08:04:05 - 08:04:11]
copy

[08:04:08 - 08:04:14]
this and I'll just paste

[08:04:11 - 08:04:17]
this so since it's the introduction the

[08:04:14 - 08:04:20]
first pointer is

[08:04:17 - 08:04:20]
about will be

[08:04:21 - 08:04:27]
about about climate change right then

[08:04:24 - 08:04:31]
second would be its uh Universal effect

[08:04:27 - 08:04:34]
is this yeah so second I'm talking about

[08:04:31 - 08:04:39]
what are the global impact it will have

[08:04:34 - 08:04:39]
so I'll add that structure right there

[08:04:40 - 08:04:43]
right now if I

[08:04:45 - 08:04:53]
feel now if I feel that this is so I'll

[08:04:50 - 08:04:55]
just put the text Bo I'll just write

[08:04:53 - 08:04:59]
24

[08:04:55 - 08:05:02]
right okay so give me then I'll just go

[08:04:59 - 08:05:04]
and make it the entire text box I'll

[08:05:02 - 08:05:06]
make it as 24 right now if I want to

[08:05:04 - 08:05:08]
justify this right let's just say that I

[08:05:06 - 08:05:11]
don't want this empty spaces so I'll

[08:05:08 - 08:05:12]
just copy paste I'll just control J so

[08:05:11 - 08:05:16]
the text would be from Line to Line

[08:05:12 - 08:05:18]
format okay so it will be justified as

[08:05:16 - 08:05:20]
mostly happens in a research paper of

[08:05:18 - 08:05:23]
some sort

[08:05:20 - 08:05:25]
right uh then I want in the second page

[08:05:23 - 08:05:29]
I want something else let's say the

[08:05:25 - 08:05:33]
topic on this significance right so I'll

[08:05:29 - 08:05:35]
go I'll just space here I'll just have

[08:05:33 - 08:05:38]
24 so I can write in that manner now I

[08:05:35 - 08:05:41]
want to include another slide in which

[08:05:38 - 08:05:45]
this is there right so let's just say

[08:05:41 - 08:05:47]
that would be the third slide now if I

[08:05:45 - 08:05:48]
want to include uh so I don't want to

[08:05:47 - 08:05:52]
include this I'm going to include

[08:05:48 - 08:05:55]
something else right uh in this I'll

[08:05:52 - 08:05:55]
just copy this all

[08:05:56 - 08:06:00]
right so

[08:05:59 - 08:06:04]
elaborate

[08:06:00 - 08:06:08]
on on the

[08:06:04 - 08:06:10]
pointers right so this can

[08:06:08 - 08:06:12]
happen so basically anything and

[08:06:10 - 08:06:15]
everything that you want can be done

[08:06:12 - 08:06:17]
through this right you don't need to you

[08:06:15 - 08:06:19]
know look around a lot of places when

[08:06:17 - 08:06:22]
you're running short of time make sure

[08:06:19 - 08:06:24]
that the the content is less technical

[08:06:22 - 08:06:26]
because then you would have to verify a

[08:06:24 - 08:06:28]
lot but in cases of for example this

[08:06:26 - 08:06:31]
right role of carbon IND and Green

[08:06:28 - 08:06:33]
Houses I would want to go and verify if

[08:06:31 - 08:06:36]
whatever this is written right is

[08:06:33 - 08:06:38]
correct or not is are the greenhouse gas

[08:06:36 - 08:06:42]
is correct or not so which in which I

[08:06:38 - 08:06:44]
can see is correct by the way but you

[08:06:42 - 08:06:48]
know you have to verify it you have to

[08:06:44 - 08:06:50]
go and verify it right so what what is

[08:06:48 - 08:06:54]
this now I can add these pointers I can

[08:06:50 - 08:06:58]
just go ahead and add the pointers right

[08:06:54 - 08:07:00]
here right so I can add the pointers so

[08:06:58 - 08:07:03]
now what is the best part about this is

[08:07:00 - 08:07:05]
let's just take that U I want a

[08:07:03 - 08:07:07]
historical Kee study to be presented

[08:07:05 - 08:07:10]
right or I can ask them for historical

[08:07:07 - 08:07:12]
case study on climate change let's just

[08:07:10 - 08:07:14]
modify some parts so I'll write for

[08:07:12 - 08:07:18]
historical case study uh on climate

[08:07:14 - 08:07:20]
change can you add

[08:07:18 - 08:07:23]
historical

[08:07:20 - 08:07:23]
exam

[08:07:25 - 08:07:30]
example right so from the very start it

[08:07:28 - 08:07:33]
is giving me the responses like the

[08:07:30 - 08:07:37]
little Ice Age dust ball keeping curve

[08:07:33 - 08:07:39]
2003 European Heat Wave uh record Arctic

[08:07:37 - 08:07:40]
heat ice melt and all that so this is

[08:07:39 - 08:07:42]
giving me this now I can add these case

[08:07:40 - 08:07:45]
studies in my presentations or what I

[08:07:42 - 08:07:47]
can do is also one more prompt I want to

[08:07:45 - 08:07:48]
introduce is that developer SL they

[08:07:47 - 08:07:51]
introducing the main objectives of a

[08:07:48 - 08:07:53]
climate change campaign include bullet

[08:07:51 - 08:07:56]
points highlighting the key goals and

[08:07:53 - 08:07:58]
strategies to be implemented right so

[08:07:56 - 08:08:02]
what does this mean this means

[08:07:58 - 08:08:05]
that uh increasing the awareness key

[08:08:02 - 08:08:07]
goals influence policy right policy

[08:08:05 - 08:08:09]
changes need to be introduced engaging

[08:08:07 - 08:08:10]
communities Inspire actions right so the

[08:08:09 - 08:08:13]
various strategies to implement is

[08:08:10 - 08:08:15]
educational programs policy advocacy so

[08:08:13 - 08:08:17]
all these things right so now the key

[08:08:15 - 08:08:19]
goals are written so how however it was

[08:08:17 - 08:08:21]
structured in key goals and strategies

[08:08:19 - 08:08:22]
so it will give me two different things

[08:08:21 - 08:08:24]
now if it's my choice if I want to add

[08:08:22 - 08:08:26]
it or not so let's just type in another

[08:08:24 - 08:08:29]
thing let's just see what it gives the

[08:08:26 - 08:08:31]
response so design a Slide featuring the

[08:08:29 - 08:08:33]
timeline of important historical events

[08:08:31 - 08:08:35]
in climate change movement utilize a

[08:08:33 - 08:08:37]
horizontal layout and add brief

[08:08:35 - 08:08:41]
descriptions to each each event to

[08:08:37 - 08:08:43]
provide context so so if the the prompts

[08:08:41 - 08:08:45]
a little more lengthier so gbd4 has this

[08:08:43 - 08:08:47]
ability higher order reasoning right so

[08:08:45 - 08:08:50]
it can give you better results in that

[08:08:47 - 08:08:53]
scenario right so the timeline it is

[08:08:50 - 08:08:55]
giving me in Timeline 7279 what are the

[08:08:53 - 08:08:59]
various things first world climate

[08:08:55 - 08:09:02]
conference then here to protocol this

[08:08:59 - 08:09:04]
Paris Accord that happened to 2015 so

[08:09:02 - 08:09:06]
that's also mentioned here right so all

[08:09:04 - 08:09:09]
the things are mentioned here how the

[08:09:06 - 08:09:11]
they are now if I want to have this

[08:09:09 - 08:09:13]
right so give me this was the most

[08:09:11 - 08:09:15]
popular one right

[08:09:13 - 08:09:18]
so

[08:09:15 - 08:09:21]
elaborate on this if I want to give a

[08:09:18 - 08:09:23]
case study much more depth so I will add

[08:09:21 - 08:09:26]
a prompt that would you know make make

[08:09:23 - 08:09:28]
it much more bigger now if I read news I

[08:09:26 - 08:09:31]
would know that there was a Paris Accord

[08:09:28 - 08:09:33]
in 2015 so what would happen is if I

[08:09:31 - 08:09:35]
want to add key sections in which I want

[08:09:33 - 08:09:38]
to talk more about right so these are

[08:09:35 - 08:09:41]
the elements that I can

[08:09:38 - 08:09:43]
use right so this will be coming in now

[08:09:41 - 08:09:46]
in Our Deck right if I have to make a

[08:09:43 - 08:09:49]
lot of changes so I will what uh I can

[08:09:46 - 08:09:52]
make the changes to the design aspect of

[08:09:49 - 08:09:54]
it I can make it uh look how it's

[08:09:52 - 08:09:57]
supposed to be right I can add changes

[08:09:54 - 08:09:59]
to the slides how I want the slides to

[08:09:57 - 08:10:01]
be right so this can be modified as much

[08:09:59 - 08:10:03]
you can play around the functionalities

[08:10:01 - 08:10:05]
of it but to create a crisp deck this is

[08:10:03 - 08:10:10]
what is needed right you can what you

[08:10:05 - 08:10:13]
can also do is if uh there is that that

[08:10:10 - 08:10:16]
kind of uh space what you can do is you

[08:10:13 - 08:10:19]
can also add extensions to the

[08:10:16 - 08:10:21]
PowerPoint in which you can basically

[08:10:19 - 08:10:23]
you have to dump what chargeability

[08:10:21 - 08:10:26]
gives you and it will automatically give

[08:10:23 - 08:10:29]
the response to it right so now we have

[08:10:26 - 08:10:32]
got the content up so one other way you

[08:10:29 - 08:10:35]
can you know ease your process of not

[08:10:32 - 08:10:37]
copy pasting it to a slide deck or to

[08:10:35 - 08:10:42]
the Microsoft PowerPoint is through a

[08:10:37 - 08:10:45]
process called as uh VBA right so what

[08:10:42 - 08:10:49]
it is let's look

[08:10:45 - 08:10:51]
at so I will just do one thing I'll just

[08:10:49 - 08:10:53]
create a dummy presentation right so

[08:10:51 - 08:10:56]
I'll create an empty presentation as you

[08:10:53 - 08:10:59]
can see so what will happen is that I

[08:10:56 - 08:10:59]
will input in

[08:10:59 - 08:11:05]
this the VBA code to create the VBA code

[08:11:02 - 08:11:06]
of this slides right so since there are

[08:11:05 - 08:11:08]
a lot of slides it will not create the

[08:11:06 - 08:11:11]
entire one but let's just take a dummy

[08:11:08 - 08:11:14]
example I'll ask Char to create a visual

[08:11:11 - 08:11:16]
code so now here I have written make a

[08:11:14 - 08:11:19]
PowerPoint VBA code for this to run on

[08:11:16 - 08:11:23]
Microsoft PowerPoint right so let's see

[08:11:19 - 08:11:25]
what the result is about so now it has

[08:11:23 - 08:11:29]
given me all the code right it has made

[08:11:25 - 08:11:31]
a code uh that can be copy pasted in

[08:11:29 - 08:11:35]
PowerPoint and the slides will be there

[08:11:31 - 08:11:36]
right so let's just copy paste this code

[08:11:35 - 08:11:38]
let's go to the empty presentation that

[08:11:36 - 08:11:42]
I have created so I'll click on this

[08:11:38 - 08:11:46]
then do alt f11 right so what will

[08:11:42 - 08:11:47]
happen is that it will open up this

[08:11:46 - 08:11:50]
window right now what I have to do is I

[08:11:47 - 08:11:52]
have to create I have to go on insert

[08:11:50 - 08:11:55]
create a new module right so this new

[08:11:52 - 08:11:57]
module is created right now what I'll do

[08:11:55 - 08:12:02]
is I'll copy paste the code that was

[08:11:57 - 08:12:04]
there in uh chat GPT gave me for VBA so

[08:12:02 - 08:12:06]
so this is basically Visual Basic for

[08:12:04 - 08:12:08]
applications what it does it is your is

[08:12:06 - 08:12:11]
your process of making a presentation so

[08:12:08 - 08:12:14]
if I run it like F5 is how do you run so

[08:12:11 - 08:12:17]
if I run it my it will automatically

[08:12:14 - 08:12:19]
create these two slides from the dump

[08:12:17 - 08:12:21]
right this was a dummy so two you can

[08:12:19 - 08:12:24]
create more if you want so you don't

[08:12:21 - 08:12:26]
individually need to add the content in

[08:12:24 - 08:12:28]
there right so that's how you make your

[08:12:26 - 08:12:30]
process easy iier in which you just have

[08:12:28 - 08:12:33]
to dump what Char GPT has given you it

[08:12:30 - 08:12:35]
will create a VBA for it you can copy

[08:12:33 - 08:12:37]
paste VBA in your presentation and make

[08:12:35 - 08:12:41]
the entire slide deck so how convenient

[08:12:37 - 08:12:44]
it is right so this is all about VBA now

[08:12:41 - 08:12:48]
let's explore how chat GPT can boost

[08:12:44 - 08:12:52]
your capabilities in digital marketing

[08:12:48 - 08:12:56]
and finance first we'll move on to chat

[08:12:52 - 08:12:59]
GPT for digital marketing and learn how

[08:12:56 - 08:13:02]
this AI can craft compelling

[08:12:59 - 08:13:05]
marketing campaigns optimize ad

[08:13:02 - 08:13:06]
performance and engage with your

[08:13:05 - 08:13:09]
audience

[08:13:06 - 08:13:13]
effectively then we will explore chat

[08:13:09 - 08:13:17]
GPT for finance and see how chat GPT can

[08:13:13 - 08:13:18]
assist in financial analysis forecasting

[08:13:17 - 08:13:22]
and providing

[08:13:18 - 08:13:25]
insights to make informed decisions

[08:13:22 - 08:13:28]
ready to dive in let's get started with

[08:13:25 - 08:13:30]
these powerful applications of chat GPT

[08:13:28 - 08:13:32]
all right so now that you understand

[08:13:30 - 08:13:35]
what exactly is artificial intelligence

[08:13:32 - 08:13:37]
and what is chat GPT it is time for us

[08:13:35 - 08:13:39]
to actually dive in in all these

[08:13:37 - 08:13:42]
different concepts related to content

[08:13:39 - 08:13:44]
creation and SEO and understand how we

[08:13:42 - 08:13:46]
can Leverage The Power of chat GPT there

[08:13:44 - 08:13:48]
so first of all in this particular

[08:13:46 - 08:13:50]
module we will be talking about chat GPT

[08:13:48 - 08:13:53]
for drafting emails when we talk about

[08:13:50 - 08:13:55]
emails and different email drafts how

[08:13:53 - 08:13:57]
can chat GPT help us there so there are

[08:13:55 - 08:13:59]
different areas where chat G can

[08:13:57 - 08:14:02]
actually help us number one is subject

[08:13:59 - 08:14:04]
lines whenever you send an email there's

[08:14:02 - 08:14:06]
a subject line that is there and subject

[08:14:04 - 08:14:08]
line is actually one of the most

[08:14:06 - 08:14:10]
important things about any email let's

[08:14:08 - 08:14:13]
say you are sending a job application to

[08:14:10 - 08:14:15]
an HR whether the HR is going to open

[08:14:13 - 08:14:17]
your email or not open your email that

[08:14:15 - 08:14:19]
completely depends upon how catchy your

[08:14:17 - 08:14:21]
subject line is similarly as an

[08:14:19 - 08:14:23]
organization or as a business owner if

[08:14:21 - 08:14:25]
you're sending an email to your customer

[08:14:23 - 08:14:27]
whether they are going to open it or

[08:14:25 - 08:14:28]
they're completely going to ignore it

[08:14:27 - 08:14:31]
that completely depends upon the subject

[08:14:28 - 08:14:33]
line so how can you generate some catchy

[08:14:31 - 08:14:35]
subject lines that can be done with the

[08:14:33 - 08:14:37]
help of chat GPT and we'll see how

[08:14:35 - 08:14:39]
exactly that can be done then AB testing

[08:14:37 - 08:14:41]
let's say you want to have two different

[08:14:39 - 08:14:44]
variations of the subject llies number

[08:14:41 - 08:14:46]
one is something and number two is close

[08:14:44 - 08:14:48]
to that the ense is same but then it is

[08:14:46 - 08:14:50]
in a different way phrased in a

[08:14:48 - 08:14:51]
different way you want to check which

[08:14:50 - 08:14:54]
one is working and which one is not

[08:14:51 - 08:14:56]
working that's nothing but AB testing so

[08:14:54 - 08:14:58]
if you want to have variation for one

[08:14:56 - 08:15:00]
subject CLI or or for email body or for

[08:14:58 - 08:15:02]
something else that can also be done

[08:15:00 - 08:15:03]
with the help of chat GPT then

[08:15:02 - 08:15:05]
translation whether you want to

[08:15:03 - 08:15:08]
translate it from English to Hindi or

[08:15:05 - 08:15:10]
Spanish or Japanese that can be done too

[08:15:08 - 08:15:12]
then personalization if you want to

[08:15:10 - 08:15:14]
change the tone of it to more

[08:15:12 - 08:15:16]
personalized more engaging all of that

[08:15:14 - 08:15:18]
can be done proof reading if you are

[08:15:16 - 08:15:19]
writing an email which is extremely

[08:15:18 - 08:15:21]
important let's say you sending it to

[08:15:19 - 08:15:24]
your potential investors as a business

[08:15:21 - 08:15:26]
owner it should not have any grammatical

[08:15:24 - 08:15:29]
or punctuation errors so how can you

[08:15:26 - 08:15:30]
proof it it well CH GP is the answer

[08:15:29 - 08:15:32]
then if you want to create some generic

[08:15:30 - 08:15:34]
templates let's say you are sending an

[08:15:32 - 08:15:36]
email to the HR or HR is sending an

[08:15:34 - 08:15:39]
email to a candidate rejecting their

[08:15:36 - 08:15:41]
profile or accepting their profile how

[08:15:39 - 08:15:43]
can we get these uh templates that can

[08:15:41 - 08:15:45]
also be done with the help of chat GPT

[08:15:43 - 08:15:47]
then response drafts let's say you got

[08:15:45 - 08:15:49]
an email and you need to draft and

[08:15:47 - 08:15:51]
response for the same how will you do

[08:15:49 - 08:15:54]
that chat GPT can help you in that area

[08:15:51 - 08:15:56]
as well and then of course email body

[08:15:54 - 08:15:58]
too so these are the different areas

[08:15:56 - 08:16:00]
where chat GPT can help us when it comes

[08:15:58 - 08:16:03]
to drafting emails and now it is time

[08:16:00 - 08:16:05]
for us to go to chat GPT and use that

[08:16:03 - 08:16:08]
tool in drafting these emails that we

[08:16:05 - 08:16:09]
talking about over here so first of all

[08:16:08 - 08:16:12]
to tell you how exactly we go about

[08:16:09 - 08:16:14]
using chat GPT let me put in a random

[08:16:12 - 08:16:16]
query saying can you create email

[08:16:14 - 08:16:18]
templates for me let me ask chat GPT and

[08:16:16 - 08:16:20]
let's see how it gives us different

[08:16:18 - 08:16:22]
outputs so if I type in the query can

[08:16:20 - 08:16:24]
you create email templates for me it

[08:16:22 - 08:16:27]
says sure I'd be happy to help you

templates for and provide any specific

[08:16:30 - 08:16:34]
details or requirements you have in mind

[08:16:33 - 08:16:36]
here are some examples of email

[08:16:34 - 08:16:38]
templates for common use cases so this

[08:16:36 - 08:16:40]
one is business introduction email where

[08:16:38 - 08:16:42]
it is talking about the recipient name

[08:16:40 - 08:16:44]
and then the email body and then finally

[08:16:42 - 08:16:47]
the salutation Etc all the things are

[08:16:44 - 08:16:49]
given in a very good way similarly job

[08:16:47 - 08:16:51]
inquiry email and then it is giving us

[08:16:49 - 08:16:53]
more examples related to some followup

[08:16:51 - 08:16:55]
email and all these different templates

[08:16:53 - 08:16:57]
are provided now let me put up a case

[08:16:55 - 08:16:59]
and let me ask chat GPT if it can give

[08:16:57 - 08:17:01]
me the email template for a very

[08:16:59 - 08:17:03]
specific situation let me say that I am

[08:17:01 - 08:17:06]
a business owner and I need to send an

[08:17:03 - 08:17:09]
email to my customers informing them

[08:17:06 - 08:17:11]

[08:17:11 - 08:17:15]
organization can you generate a template

[08:17:13 - 08:17:17]
for me let me put in this query and see

[08:17:15 - 08:17:19]
what are the different results that we

[08:17:17 - 08:17:22]
get so as you can see if I type in the

[08:17:19 - 08:17:24]
query I'm a business owner and I need to

[08:17:22 - 08:17:26]
send an email to my customers informing

[08:17:26 - 08:17:30]
account on all my products and I'm

[08:17:28 - 08:17:32]
asking chat GPT to generate a template

[08:17:30 - 08:17:35]
for me so if I press enter you can see

[08:17:32 - 08:17:37]
it is going to give us an answer it says

[08:17:35 - 08:17:38]
sure here's a template for an email

[08:17:37 - 08:17:41]

[08:28:58 - 08:29:03]
an email to a candidate who's rejected

[08:29:01 - 08:29:05]
or whose profile is rejected now let me

[08:29:03 - 08:29:08]
take another example and let me ask chat

[08:29:05 - 08:29:10]
GP to give me a sample email template

[08:29:08 - 08:29:13]
that I can use to inform the sellers of

[08:29:10 - 08:29:15]
let's say my e-commerce company about a

[08:29:13 - 08:29:17]
new update in the business process

[08:29:15 - 08:29:19]

[08:29:25 - 08:29:29]
them about that business process change

chat GPT that can you please translate

[08:30:30 - 08:30:36]
the same template to German and you can

[08:30:34 - 08:30:38]
see that chat GPD is able to actually

[08:30:36 - 08:30:40]
translate the same email template into

[08:30:38 - 08:30:42]
some other language here we took the

[08:30:40 - 08:30:44]
example of German language similarly you

[08:30:42 - 08:30:46]
can take the example of any other

[08:30:44 - 08:30:48]
language let's say Hindi Spanish or any

[08:30:46 - 08:30:51]
other language you can ask chat GPT to

into that language and it will be able

[08:30:52 - 08:30:57]
to do that for you that is the power of

[08:30:55 - 08:30:59]
AI and that's precisely how we can

[08:30:57 - 08:31:01]
leverage chat GP when it comes to

[08:30:59 - 08:31:04]
drafting emails now let me take one

[08:31:01 - 08:31:06]
final example let me ask chat GPT that I

[08:31:04 - 08:31:09]
need to send a feedback email to one of

[08:31:06 - 08:31:10]
my subordinates within the organization

[08:31:09 - 08:31:12]
let's say there's a problem with that

[08:31:10 - 08:31:15]
particular person that he's constantly

[08:31:12 - 08:31:17]
missing the deadlines can you provide me

[08:31:15 - 08:31:19]
with a sample template let me put in

[08:31:17 - 08:31:21]
that query and see what exactly are the

[08:31:19 - 08:31:23]
results that I can expect from chat GPD

[08:31:21 - 08:31:26]
we always have to be ensure whenever we

[08:31:23 - 08:31:27]
are typing information like this that we

[08:31:26 - 08:31:30]
want constructive feedback that is

[08:31:27 - 08:31:32]
generated let's see whether chat GP is

[08:31:30 - 08:31:34]
able to recognize that and is providing

[08:31:32 - 08:31:36]
us constructive feedback or not so as

[08:31:34 - 08:31:38]
you can see if I type in the query I

[08:31:36 - 08:31:40]
need to send a feedback email to one of

[08:31:38 - 08:31:42]
my subordinates within the organization

[08:31:40 - 08:31:44]
who's constantly missing deadlines can

[08:31:42 - 08:31:46]
you provide me with a sample template

[08:31:44 - 08:31:48]
here you go subject is feedback on

[08:31:46 - 08:31:50]
meeting deadlines and here's the

[08:31:48 - 08:31:52]
employee name dear employee I hope this

[08:31:50 - 08:31:54]
email finds you well I would like to

[08:31:52 - 08:31:56]
provide you with some feedback regarding

[08:31:54 - 08:31:58]
meeting deadlines as part of your role

[08:31:56 - 08:32:00]
at this and this organization as your

[08:31:58 - 08:32:01]
manager I value your contributions to

[08:32:00 - 08:32:04]
the team and believe that your skills

[08:32:01 - 08:32:06]
can further benefit the organization so

[08:32:04 - 08:32:09]
this is one of the major good thing

[08:32:06 - 08:32:11]
which is there about GPT or chat GPT

[08:32:09 - 08:32:12]
that it gives you constructive feedback

[08:32:11 - 08:32:15]
by understanding the tone of your

[08:32:12 - 08:32:17]
question so here I clearly mentioned

[08:32:15 - 08:32:19]
that I need to send a feedback email to

[08:32:17 - 08:32:21]
one of my subordinates now chat GPT has

[08:32:19 - 08:32:23]
the understanding that definitely the

[08:32:21 - 08:32:25]
feedback has to be in a constructive way

[08:32:23 - 08:32:27]
so here it is talking about that as your

[08:32:25 - 08:32:29]
manager I value your contribution so it

[08:32:27 - 08:32:31]
is clearly mentioning that what exactly

[08:32:29 - 08:32:33]
are the good parts what are the bad

[08:32:31 - 08:32:35]
parts and it is balancing the same while

[08:32:33 - 08:32:37]
giving a feedback to the subordinate by

[08:32:35 - 08:32:39]
a particular manager here it is

[08:32:37 - 08:32:41]
mentioning that as a team we rely on

[08:32:39 - 08:32:43]
each other to complete tasks and

[08:32:41 - 08:32:45]
deliverables in a timely manner

[08:32:43 - 08:32:47]
consistently missing deadlines can have

[08:32:45 - 08:32:49]
an impact on the team's productivity and

[08:32:47 - 08:32:52]
may result in delays that can affect the

[08:32:49 - 08:32:53]
overall progress of our project chat GPT

[08:32:52 - 08:32:56]
is able to understand that whenever we

[08:32:53 - 08:32:58]
are giving the feedback it is Extreme

[08:32:56 - 08:33:00]
important that you make the other person

[08:32:58 - 08:33:02]
understand the impact of why they are

[08:33:00 - 08:33:04]
missing something and once they miss it

[08:33:02 - 08:33:06]
what exactly is the impact of that on

[08:33:04 - 08:33:08]
the entire team and the organization it

[08:33:06 - 08:33:11]
is able to not just able to understand

[08:33:08 - 08:33:14]
it but also is typing the same detail in

[08:33:11 - 08:33:16]
the email draft that we asked it for now

[08:33:14 - 08:33:18]
let's say you find it too lengthy you

[08:33:16 - 08:33:19]
can ask chat GPT to make it more crisp

[08:33:18 - 08:33:22]
make it more shorter make it more

[08:33:19 - 08:33:24]
empathetic add a particular detail you

[08:33:22 - 08:33:26]
can do all of that you can tweak the

[08:33:24 - 08:33:28]
particular template in whatever way you

[08:33:26 - 08:33:30]
like but that's how we use chat GPT when

module we will be understanding how we

[08:34:24 - 08:34:29]
Instagram LinkedIn Facebook Facebook

[08:34:26 - 08:34:30]
Twitter Etc let's try and understand

[08:34:29 - 08:34:33]
what are the different areas where chat

[08:34:30 - 08:34:36]
GPD can actually help us number one is

[08:34:33 - 08:34:37]
definitely generating ideas so for

[08:34:36 - 08:34:39]
social media post it is extremely

[08:34:37 - 08:34:40]
important that you have some catchy

[08:34:39 - 08:34:43]
ideas so that you can compete with your

[08:34:40 - 08:34:45]
Brands and whatever other brands are

[08:34:43 - 08:34:46]
there which are in the same industry you

[08:34:45 - 08:34:48]
have to compete with them so to show

[08:34:46 - 08:34:50]
yourself and gain a competitive

[08:34:48 - 08:34:52]
Advantage if you need to generate some

[08:34:50 - 08:34:54]
ideas you can definitely take help from

[08:34:52 - 08:34:57]
chat GPT if you want to change the tone

[08:34:54 - 08:34:58]
and style let's on LinkedIn the kind of

[08:34:57 - 08:35:00]
posts you will be putting those will be

[08:34:58 - 08:35:02]
more professional but if you're talking

[08:35:00 - 08:35:04]
about let's say Tik Tok or let's say you

[08:35:02 - 08:35:06]
are talking about some other platform

[08:35:04 - 08:35:08]
Instagram stories there the tone will be

[08:35:06 - 08:35:10]
a bit casual similarly on Twitter the

[08:35:08 - 08:35:12]
tone will be a little different so if

[08:35:10 - 08:35:14]
you want to create post for all these

[08:35:12 - 08:35:16]
different platforms and you want to

[08:35:14 - 08:35:18]
change the tone accordingly depending

[08:35:16 - 08:35:19]
upon the platform that can also be done

[08:35:18 - 08:35:22]
with the help of chat GPD then

[08:35:19 - 08:35:24]
repurposing if you want to create a post

[08:35:22 - 08:35:25]
for Twitter and you want to repurpose

[08:35:24 - 08:35:28]
the same for some other social social

[08:35:25 - 08:35:30]
media platform as well that can also be

[08:35:28 - 08:35:32]
done you can repurpose the same post for

[08:35:30 - 08:35:35]
different platforms based upon their

[08:35:32 - 08:35:37]
tone and style then you can do sentiment

[08:35:35 - 08:35:39]
analysis as well let's say on YouTube

[08:35:37 - 08:35:40]
you see a few comments on your videos

[08:35:39 - 08:35:43]
you can copy paste the same comments and

[08:35:40 - 08:35:45]
you can ask chat GP what exactly is the

[08:35:43 - 08:35:47]
sentiment of all those comments and it

[08:35:45 - 08:35:49]
can summarize the entire thing for you

[08:35:47 - 08:35:51]
and it can give you a per about what

[08:35:49 - 08:35:54]
exactly is the overall feedback about

[08:35:51 - 08:35:55]
that particular video similarly from

[08:35:54 - 08:35:57]
Instagram you can copy paste the

[08:35:55 - 08:35:59]
comments you can get the sentiment

[08:35:57 - 08:36:01]
analysis done with the help of chat GPD

[08:35:59 - 08:36:03]
then optimization let's say you want to

[08:36:01 - 08:36:06]
figure out what exactly is the best time

[08:36:03 - 08:36:08]
to post content on Instagram or what is

[08:36:06 - 08:36:10]
the best time to post content on Twitter

[08:36:08 - 08:36:11]
if you want to figure out these things

[08:36:10 - 08:36:13]
that can also be done with the help of

[08:36:11 - 08:36:16]
chat GPT and you can optimize your

[08:36:13 - 08:36:18]
content accordingly then hashtags for

[08:36:16 - 08:36:20]
Instagram Facebook hashtags are very

[08:36:18 - 08:36:22]
very important and can give you a lot of

[08:36:20 - 08:36:26]
visibility how can you do that with the

[08:36:22 - 08:36:28]
help of chat GPT let's go and explore

[08:36:26 - 08:36:31]
now first of all let me talk to Chad GPT

[08:36:28 - 08:36:33]
in terms of generating some ideas I want

[08:36:31 - 08:36:36]
to ask Chad GP if it can give me a few

[08:36:33 - 08:36:38]

prompt and chat GPT will give you

[08:46:57 - 08:47:01]
results which are specific to your

[08:46:59 - 08:47:03]
business requirements now let's say

[08:47:01 - 08:47:04]
let's try and understand how chat GPT

[08:47:03 - 08:47:06]
can help us when it comes to

[08:47:04 - 08:47:08]
optimization so first of all let me ask

[08:47:06 - 08:47:11]
chat GPT let's say a random question

[08:47:08 - 08:47:13]
that what is the ideal duration for the

[08:47:11 - 08:47:14]
Instagram reel I have created The Reel

[08:47:13 - 08:47:17]
but I don't know what should be the

[08:47:14 - 08:47:19]
ideal duration so let me ask Chad GPT to

[08:47:17 - 08:47:21]
optimize The Reel accordingly and here

[08:47:19 - 08:47:23]
you go the ideal duration for an

[08:47:21 - 08:47:25]
Instagram reel is typically between 15

[08:47:23 - 08:47:27]
to 30 seconds Instagram reals are

[08:47:25 - 08:47:28]
designed to be short engaging and easy

[08:47:27 - 08:47:31]
to consume so it's important to keep

[08:47:28 - 08:47:33]
them concise and focused which is right

[08:47:31 - 08:47:34]
you can definitely do that similarly if

[08:47:33 - 08:47:36]
you have more questions let's say you

[08:47:34 - 08:47:38]
want to ask chat GPT that what exactly

[08:47:36 - 08:47:40]
is the ideal time to tweet to get better

[08:47:38 - 08:47:42]
attraction or similarly let's say what

[08:47:40 - 08:47:44]
exactly is the ideal time to put a

[08:47:42 - 08:47:46]
Instagram story to get the better

[08:47:44 - 08:47:48]
attraction from a specific target

[08:47:46 - 08:47:50]
audience it can suggest you answers and

[08:47:48 - 08:47:52]
you can actually Implement that to see

[08:47:50 - 08:47:55]
the result on your own and definitely it

[08:47:52 - 08:47:56]
can help you in all those business needs

[08:47:55 - 08:47:58]
different requirements for different

[08:47:56 - 08:48:00]
social media platforms now let's also

[08:47:58 - 08:48:02]
try and understand how chat GPT can

[08:48:00 - 08:48:05]
actually help us when it comes to

[08:48:02 - 08:48:07]
sentiment analysis so let's say I given

[08:48:05 - 08:48:10]
some prompts or some comments to chat

[08:48:07 - 08:48:12]
GPT that I received on my Facebook post

[08:48:10 - 08:48:14]
and let me ask chat GP to perform a

[08:48:12 - 08:48:16]
sentiment analysis for the same so I

[08:48:14 - 08:48:18]
will be asking Chad GP to actually give

[08:48:16 - 08:48:20]
me that what is the sentiment of the

[08:48:18 - 08:48:22]
below comments that I received on my

[08:48:20 - 08:48:24]
Facebook post and let me see what

[08:48:22 - 08:48:26]
exactly is the result that we can expect

[08:48:24 - 08:48:28]
so as you can see over here I have put

[08:48:26 - 08:48:29]
in the query that what is the sentiment

[08:48:28 - 08:48:32]
of the below comments I received on my

[08:48:29 - 08:48:33]
Facebook post your clothes collection is

[08:48:32 - 08:48:35]
amazing or I love the denim jacket

[08:48:33 - 08:48:37]
collection the most or I don't like the

[08:48:35 - 08:48:39]
shoes but the jackets look damn good or

[08:48:37 - 08:48:41]
the shoes are very uncomfortable love

[08:48:39 - 08:48:42]
this brand so let's say these are some

[08:48:41 - 08:48:44]
of the comments that I have got on my

[08:48:42 - 08:48:46]
Facebook post as a clothing brand and

[08:48:44 - 08:48:47]
now I want to ask Chad GP to actually

[08:48:46 - 08:48:49]
give me the sentiment of the below

[08:48:47 - 08:48:51]
comments I don't want to go to each of

[08:48:49 - 08:48:53]
these comments one after the other and I

[08:48:51 - 08:48:56]
asked Chad GPT to do the same task for

[08:48:53 - 08:48:58]
me and and here's the result so first of

[08:48:56 - 08:49:00]
all chat gbt is talking about what

[08:48:58 - 08:49:02]
exactly are the positive sentiment and

[08:49:00 - 08:49:04]
then what is the mixed one and what is

[08:49:02 - 08:49:05]
the negative one let's say again I don't

[08:49:04 - 08:49:08]
want to go to all of these I can simply

[08:49:05 - 08:49:10]
ask chat GPT to summarize the sentiment

[08:49:08 - 08:49:13]
let's say I write

[08:49:10 - 08:49:19]
summarize the

[08:49:13 - 08:49:22]
sentiment of the above mentioned

[08:49:19 - 08:49:24]
comments and enter and you can see that

[08:49:22 - 08:49:26]
the overall sentiment of the comments is

[08:49:24 - 08:49:28]
mostly positive with comments expressing

[08:49:26 - 08:49:29]
admiration for clothing collection denim

[08:49:28 - 08:49:31]
jacket collection and the brand as a

[08:49:29 - 08:49:33]
whole there are also mixed sentiments

[08:49:31 - 08:49:35]
where the commentators are like the

[08:49:33 - 08:49:37]
jackets but dislike the shoes due to

[08:49:35 - 08:49:40]
discomfort however there is one negative

[08:49:37 - 08:49:42]
comment warning others not to buy from

[08:49:40 - 08:49:44]
the brand due to negative feedback about

[08:49:42 - 08:49:46]
the shoes so by reading this I can

[08:49:44 - 08:49:47]
simply make out that people are liking

[08:49:46 - 08:49:50]
the denim jackets and other clothing

[08:49:47 - 08:49:51]
products but people simply are not

[08:49:50 - 08:49:53]
liking the shoes and the major issues

[08:49:51 - 08:49:56]
are discomfort while they're wearing the

[08:49:53 - 08:49:57]
shoes now I can make the changes in my

[08:49:56 - 08:50:00]
product accordingly so that's how you

[08:49:57 - 08:50:02]
can use the power of AI specifically

[08:50:00 - 08:50:04]
chat GPT when it comes to different

information or entertainment to

[09:18:36 - 09:18:40]

[09:18:38 - 09:18:42]
trust and credibility right so this is

[09:18:40 - 09:18:44]
the main core components of content

[09:18:42 - 09:18:46]
marketing when you're creating content

[09:18:44 - 09:18:49]
you want your end users to gain some

[09:18:46 - 09:18:51]
valuable information or may be it for an

[09:18:49 - 09:18:53]
entertainment purpose right you see you

[09:18:51 - 09:18:55]
see a lot of YouTube channel channels

[09:18:53 - 09:18:57]
that maybe they are uh the genre would

[09:18:55 - 09:18:59]
be food maybe it would be travel maybe

[09:18:57 - 09:19:01]
it would be comedy maybe it would be

[09:18:59 - 09:19:03]
standup shows maybe a lot lot more

[09:19:01 - 09:19:06]
things maybe it would be a meme channel

[09:19:03 - 09:19:08]
so you have a lot of uh lot of things

[09:19:06 - 09:19:11]
that revolve lot of themes to pick up

[09:19:08 - 09:19:13]
from right but you want at the end that

[09:19:11 - 09:19:15]
content to be viewed by a lot of people

[09:19:13 - 09:19:17]
around right so for that digital

[09:19:15 - 09:19:20]
marketing plays a crucial role how you

[09:19:17 - 09:19:21]
place your content maybe it is it

[09:19:20 - 09:19:23]
depends on the timing of when you post

[09:19:21 - 09:19:25]
it maybe it depends on a lot of

[09:19:23 - 09:19:27]
different factors right maybe the

[09:19:25 - 09:19:29]
keywords that you use the optimization

[09:19:27 - 09:19:31]
of those keywords right the search

[09:19:29 - 09:19:33]
volumes of those keywords right so all

[09:19:31 - 09:19:35]
these things uh take a very very

[09:19:33 - 09:19:37]
important role maybe you would have seen

[09:19:35 - 09:19:39]
reals that are coming up these days

[09:19:37 - 09:19:42]
right the song that you pick up that is

[09:19:39 - 09:19:44]
also very very crucial in making uh your

[09:19:42 - 09:19:47]
content visible yeah your brand identity

[09:19:44 - 09:19:49]
to be visible to a lot more people right

[09:19:47 - 09:19:51]
so this can be done through various

[09:19:49 - 09:19:53]
channels like blog posts maybe it would

[09:19:51 - 09:19:55]
be articles that you write videos maybe

[09:19:53 - 09:19:57]
the podcast now podcasts are something

[09:19:55 - 09:19:59]
that have been growing recently right A

[09:19:57 - 09:20:02]
lot of people do not have that kind of

[09:19:59 - 09:20:04]
time to you know sit and watch a YouTube

[09:20:02 - 09:20:07]
video of two people talking so what do

[09:20:04 - 09:20:08]
they do they they just uh hear the the

[09:20:07 - 09:20:11]
podcast that comes up now that is also

[09:20:08 - 09:20:13]
something that is really trending then

[09:20:11 - 09:20:15]
social media and lot Moree the second

[09:20:13 - 09:20:17]
element that is there is search engine

[09:20:15 - 09:20:19]
optimization and this is the my this is

[09:20:17 - 09:20:22]
my favorite of the lot now search engine

[09:20:19 - 09:20:24]
optimization refers to the process of

[09:20:22 - 09:20:27]
improving right is is the process of

[09:20:24 - 09:20:29]
improving a website's visibility right

[09:20:27 - 09:20:31]
if you have a brand let's say a clothing

[09:20:29 - 09:20:33]
brand right so you would have a website

[09:20:31 - 09:20:35]
that would be there now you would want

[09:20:33 - 09:20:38]
anyone who would want to search that

[09:20:35 - 09:20:39]
website right or maybe search your brand

[09:20:38 - 09:20:41]
right they would just go to the search

[09:20:39 - 09:20:44]
engine and type your brand let's say you

[09:20:41 - 09:20:47]
have XYZ as a brand so they would just

[09:20:44 - 09:20:49]
type in XYZ now what would happened is

[09:20:47 - 09:20:52]
that Google would give you results and

[09:20:49 - 09:20:54]
now as a brand what you want is that

[09:20:52 - 09:20:57]
your website your Brand's website should

[09:20:54 - 09:21:00]
be placed at the top right that is what

[09:20:57 - 09:21:03]
it is now as a consumer of of internet

[09:21:00 - 09:21:05]
right this may be a a habit or you would

[09:21:03 - 09:21:07]
have known that whenever you search for

[09:21:05 - 09:21:10]
anything on Google you would not go past

[09:21:07 - 09:21:11]
the first page of Google right first

[09:21:10 - 09:21:14]
page is also a lot that I'm talking

[09:21:11 - 09:21:17]
about you won't go more than five or six

[09:21:14 - 09:21:19]
top links that come up right so this is

[09:21:17 - 09:21:20]
the same way now from a Brand's

[09:21:19 - 09:21:22]
perspective they want to Target that

[09:21:20 - 09:21:24]
first five websites because because they

[09:21:22 - 09:21:27]
know that these are the ones that would

[09:21:24 - 09:21:30]
be clicked by the customers a lot now

[09:21:27 - 09:21:33]
search engine optimization is exactly

[09:21:30 - 09:21:37]
that what helps you organically place

[09:21:33 - 09:21:39]
your website at the top right so it is a

[09:21:37 - 09:21:41]
process of improving a websites

[09:21:39 - 09:21:44]
visibility ranking in the search engine

[09:21:41 - 09:21:47]
results page which is also known as

[09:21:44 - 09:21:49]
seps it involves optimizing the various

[09:21:47 - 09:21:51]
elements of a website including the

[09:21:49 - 09:21:54]
content the keywords The Meta tags the

[09:21:51 - 09:21:57]
bank links to make it more attractive to

[09:21:54 - 09:21:59]
the search engines now the goal of SEO

[09:21:57 - 09:22:02]
that is search engine optimization is to

[09:21:59 - 09:22:04]
increase the organic traffic what does

[09:22:02 - 09:22:06]
organic means it is non-paid traffic

[09:22:04 - 09:22:09]
right I'm not paying anything to Google

[09:22:06 - 09:22:11]
to place my website at the top right by

[09:22:09 - 09:22:13]
improving the search engine rankings for

[09:22:11 - 09:22:15]
Relevant keywords and phrases now I'll

[09:22:13 - 09:22:19]
give you a bit of demo what exactly I'm

[09:22:15 - 09:22:22]
talking about right so uh let's just uh

[09:22:19 - 09:22:25]
type in google.in and we'll we'll search

[09:22:22 - 09:22:29]
something right let's just say

[09:22:25 - 09:22:30]
uh English course right these are

[09:22:29 - 09:22:32]
generally the things that we talk about

[09:22:30 - 09:22:35]
let's say English course online now I

[09:22:32 - 09:22:39]
click on it right now these are the

[09:22:35 - 09:22:40]
websites that Google show show me right

[09:22:39 - 09:22:42]
so now what do I want what do as a

[09:22:40 - 09:22:46]
consumer I would click I would click the

[09:22:42 - 09:22:47]
first websites that come up now you

[09:22:46 - 09:22:50]
would see there's something known as

[09:22:47 - 09:22:53]
sponsored that is written here right now

[09:22:50 - 09:22:55]
these are the ones that these particular

[09:22:53 - 09:22:58]
website have paid Google to rank them on

[09:22:55 - 09:23:00]
the top right they have paid x amount to

[09:22:58 - 09:23:02]
make sure that their website is shown

[09:23:00 - 09:23:05]
right so this is not organic this is not

[09:23:02 - 09:23:08]
SEO right this is sem search engine

[09:23:05 - 09:23:10]
marketing where the companies pay Google

[09:23:08 - 09:23:13]
to rank them on the top but when you

[09:23:10 - 09:23:15]
move down there you can see that that

[09:23:13 - 09:23:18]
the websites that do not have the

[09:23:15 - 09:23:20]
sponsored tag written on them right

[09:23:18 - 09:23:23]
these are the ones that are organically

[09:23:20 - 09:23:25]
on the top that they have not paid

[09:23:23 - 09:23:27]
anything to Google basically so this is

[09:23:25 - 09:23:29]
what every brand aims for that

[09:23:27 - 09:23:32]
organically without giving money to

[09:23:29 - 09:23:34]
Google if it can show up at the top

[09:23:32 - 09:23:36]
that's what every brand aims for so this

[09:23:34 - 09:23:38]
is basically the way the the procedures

[09:23:36 - 09:23:40]
that are involved maybe the keywords

[09:23:38 - 09:23:43]
longtail short tail keywords lot of

[09:23:40 - 09:23:45]
different elements if they can get that

[09:23:43 - 09:23:49]
website to rank using these strategies

[09:23:45 - 09:23:51]
right how you write that this meta tags

[09:23:49 - 09:23:53]
and all that how do you use keywords

[09:23:51 - 09:23:55]
right see English course online so

[09:23:53 - 09:23:57]
English course and online all three are

[09:23:55 - 09:23:59]
keywords now how much they have placed

[09:23:57 - 09:24:01]
those keywords how they have clubbed it

[09:23:59 - 09:24:04]
together so all that matters so this is

[09:24:01 - 09:24:06]
search engine optimization then is

[09:24:04 - 09:24:08]
paperclick now paperclick is an online

[09:24:06 - 09:24:11]
advertising model in which the advertis

[09:24:08 - 09:24:13]
pay a fee each time their ad is clicked

[09:24:11 - 09:24:16]
so it is typically used in search engine

[09:24:13 - 09:24:18]
advertising where the advertisers bid on

[09:24:16 - 09:24:20]
the keywords relevant to the target

[09:24:18 - 09:24:22]
audience so a real time bidding happens

[09:24:20 - 09:24:24]
in this scenario right when a user

[09:24:22 - 09:24:26]
searches for a keyword the search engine

[09:24:24 - 09:24:29]
displays relevant ads and the

[09:24:26 - 09:24:32]
advertisers pay for each click their ad

[09:24:29 - 09:24:34]
receives now payperclick campaigns can

[09:24:32 - 09:24:36]
be highly targeted and allowing the

[09:24:34 - 09:24:38]
advertisers to reach a specific audience

[09:24:36 - 09:24:41]
and measure the effectiveness of their

[09:24:38 - 09:24:43]
ads then is social media marketing so

[09:24:41 - 09:24:45]
social media marketing involves social

[09:24:43 - 09:24:48]
media platforms such as Facebook

[09:24:45 - 09:24:50]

[09:24:53 - 09:24:58]
or they increase their Brand's

[09:24:55 - 09:24:59]
visibility right so it involves creating

[09:24:58 - 09:25:03]
and sharing various content now if you

[09:24:59 - 09:25:06]
would have seen uh a lot of uh lot of

[09:25:03 - 09:25:08]

Brands you know play so it is commonly

write that using chargeability you can

[09:27:20 - 09:27:25]
make it much more innovative but at the

[09:27:36 - 09:27:40]
present and drive those convergence so

[09:27:38 - 09:27:42]
these the these are the major elements

[09:27:40 - 09:27:45]
that are there in email marketing the

[09:27:42 - 09:27:47]
end part is the affiliate marketing now

[09:27:45 - 09:27:48]
so it's a performance-based marketing

[09:27:47 - 09:27:50]
right it's a model where where

[09:27:48 - 09:27:53]
individuals earn a commission by

[09:27:50 - 09:27:55]
promoting and driving sales of a company

[09:27:53 - 09:27:57]
or or a product right so it's like a

[09:27:55 - 09:27:59]
chain based model it's a pyramid model

[09:27:57 - 09:28:02]
so all these comes under the the

[09:27:59 - 09:28:04]
affiliate marketing strategies right so

[09:28:02 - 09:28:05]
affiliate typically receives a unique

[09:28:05 - 09:28:10]
product various channels using the

[09:28:07 - 09:28:13]
website blogs social media both using so

[09:28:10 - 09:28:15]
it's the involvement it's not just the

[09:28:13 - 09:28:18]
brand that is selling the products it's

[09:28:15 - 09:28:20]
like individual customers also trying

[09:28:18 - 09:28:22]
their best to sell the products in order

[09:28:20 - 09:28:24]
to gain their personal advantage or to

[09:28:22 - 09:28:26]

[09:28:24 - 09:28:28]
marketing works so it's it's like a

[09:28:26 - 09:28:30]
chain model it's like a pyramid model in

[09:28:28 - 09:28:32]
which it keeps on going and going and

[09:28:30 - 09:28:35]
going there's no stop to it so that's

[09:28:32 - 09:28:36]
affiliate marketing now let's try to

[09:28:35 - 09:28:39]
understand the first element that is

[09:28:36 - 09:28:42]
Market segmentation now how we will go

[09:28:39 - 09:28:45]
through chat gbt is that I'll take a

[09:28:42 - 09:28:48]
example of a hypothetical situation

[09:28:45 - 09:28:52]
let's say that I have no clue about what

[09:28:48 - 09:28:54]
digital marketing is now I want to start

[09:28:52 - 09:28:56]
company a brand a clothing brand

[09:28:54 - 09:28:58]
probably uh let's say traditional

[09:28:56 - 09:29:03]
somewhat about traditional Indian wear

[09:28:58 - 09:29:05]
now I want uh to understand the key

[09:29:03 - 09:29:07]
principles of digital marketing and how

[09:29:05 - 09:29:10]
can I can enhance my brand right how I

[09:29:07 - 09:29:13]
can explore my brand how can I find more

[09:29:10 - 09:29:16]
things that in a digital way would catch

[09:29:13 - 09:29:18]
uh catch up right which what would that

[09:29:16 - 09:29:21]
mean that would mean that my brand would

[09:29:18 - 09:29:23]
grow organically in a digital space now

[09:29:21 - 09:29:25]
I would heavily need digital marketing

[09:29:23 - 09:29:27]
because I'm not going and setting up a

[09:29:25 - 09:29:29]
store or maybe if I want to then I can

[09:29:27 - 09:29:31]
just ask him what are the things that

[09:29:29 - 09:29:33]
are required but in a nutshell I would

[09:29:31 - 09:29:36]
want to launch my brand online and I

[09:29:33 - 09:29:38]
would have a lot of elements involved

[09:29:36 - 09:29:42]
that the questions I would be asking is

[09:29:38 - 09:29:45]
about about my brand okay so let's get

[09:29:42 - 09:29:48]
started so let's start with a fresh

[09:29:45 - 09:29:51]
window so this is the fresh window now

[09:29:48 - 09:29:53]
let me type in my first query right so I

[09:29:51 - 09:29:56]
would say test me names for a clothing

[09:29:53 - 09:29:58]
brand that focuses on traditional Indian

[09:29:56 - 09:30:01]
wear now the way you structure your

[09:29:58 - 09:30:02]
question is also very important now I'm

[09:30:01 - 09:30:04]
asking it suggest me names for a

[09:30:02 - 09:30:06]

[09:30:15 - 09:30:23]
add make sure it

[09:30:19 - 09:30:23]
stands out in

[09:30:24 - 09:30:28]
the

[09:30:25 - 09:30:30]
digital space right so now the first

[09:30:28 - 09:30:32]
problem that I'll type is suggest me the

[09:34:09 - 09:34:13]
yeah so let's just see what what comes

[09:34:20 - 09:34:25]
up right so now it has given me words

[09:34:23 - 09:34:28]
that that are that starts from the

[09:34:25 - 09:34:30]
letter r in a more Indian historic

[09:34:28 - 09:34:31]
manner right so I don't need to type in

[09:34:30 - 09:34:33]
again that okay tell me in the

[09:34:31 - 09:34:36]
traditional manner in Indian Heritage

[09:34:33 - 09:34:38]
manner something it would understand or

[09:34:36 - 09:34:41]
so that's that's what I'm talking about

[09:34:38 - 09:34:43]
when it has the memory of its own now if

[09:34:41 - 09:34:48]
the name is sorted out okay if let's say

[09:34:43 - 09:34:49]
I've chosen one word right so if I've

[09:34:48 - 09:34:51]
let's say just taken up one random one

[09:34:49 - 09:34:54]
Raj Darbar let's just say that I've

[09:34:51 - 09:34:56]
named my brand Raj Darbar so I would add

[09:34:54 - 09:34:58]
list down a few catchy taglines for the

[09:34:56 - 09:35:00]
brand right so let's just see what it

[09:34:58 - 09:35:00]
comes up

[09:35:01 - 09:35:06]
with so it has given me a lot of

[09:35:03 - 09:35:08]
different lot of variety right probably

[09:35:06 - 09:35:09]
we would end up if if my vocabulary is

[09:35:08 - 09:35:12]
not good I'm a lay man of digital

[09:35:09 - 09:35:15]
marketing I would not understand the way

[09:35:12 - 09:35:17]
things the taglines work right I may be

[09:35:15 - 09:35:18]
not that creative to write down tag

[09:35:17 - 09:35:20]
lines maybe you have to hire hire a

[09:35:18 - 09:35:22]
third party individual to do that right

[09:35:20 - 09:35:25]
so it cuts down on the cost that is

[09:35:22 - 09:35:26]
required right to to for you to just

[09:35:25 - 09:35:28]
start off with your brand now it has

[09:35:26 - 09:35:31]
given me fabulous fabulous results like

[09:35:28 - 09:35:33]
embrace the color of tradition right

[09:35:31 - 09:35:36]
where Heritage meets fashion right what

[09:35:33 - 09:35:39]
a fabulous tagline where Heritage meets

[09:35:36 - 09:35:42]
fashion unve your ethnic charm right so

[09:35:39 - 09:35:43]
all these different types of taglines

[09:35:42 - 09:35:45]
are there now you can choose it from

[09:35:43 - 09:35:47]
here now if I want to add more

[09:35:45 - 09:35:50]
customization in this as well I can do

[09:35:47 - 09:35:53]
that of course so now my brand title is

[09:35:50 - 09:35:55]
fixed my brand name is fixed brand tag

[09:35:53 - 09:35:57]
tagline is fixed now what next to do

[09:35:55 - 09:36:00]
right now the next thing is to find out

[09:35:57 - 09:36:02]
your Tam that is total addressable

[09:36:00 - 09:36:05]
market so in general I'll just ask it

[09:36:02 - 09:36:07]
what would be the target audience online

[09:36:05 - 09:36:09]
considering the brand only sells to the

[09:36:07 - 09:36:11]
online websites and caters to the Indian

[09:36:09 - 09:36:13]
market right so now I don't have to

[09:36:11 - 09:36:15]
think that okay if the European market

[09:36:13 - 09:36:17]
or maybe the North American Market maybe

[09:36:15 - 09:36:20]
an Australian Market want to cover it up

[09:36:17 - 09:36:22]
I I'm just focused on selling this this

[09:36:20 - 09:36:24]
through an online website in India so

[09:36:22 - 09:36:25]
what would be the target audience right

[09:36:24 - 09:36:27]
and considering that it's a historical

[09:36:25 - 09:36:29]
brand so let's just see what what uh

[09:36:27 - 09:36:33]
Char gives

[09:36:29 - 09:36:35]
us yeah so as we can see that uh Char

[09:36:33 - 09:36:37]
has given me that considering that your

[09:36:35 - 09:36:39]
brand sells exclusively through the

[09:36:37 - 09:36:42]
online websites and caters specifically

[09:36:39 - 09:36:44]
to the Indian market the target audience

[09:36:42 - 09:36:46]
would be Urban Indians number one why

[09:36:44 - 09:36:48]
has given me the reason as well

[09:36:46 - 09:36:50]
individuals residing in urban areas

[09:36:48 - 09:36:52]
would have access to the internet and

[09:36:50 - 09:36:55]
interested in purchasing the traditional

[09:36:52 - 09:36:57]
Indian wear online fashion conscious

[09:36:55 - 09:36:59]
Indians people who would actively follow

[09:36:57 - 09:37:01]
fashion trends and seek stylish

[09:36:59 - 09:37:03]
Contemporary Indian clothing options

[09:37:01 - 09:37:06]
okay one thing that I've not added in my

[09:37:03 - 09:37:09]
prompt is that how do I want my brand to

[09:37:06 - 09:37:13]
be what is it like a modern ethnic or is

[09:37:09 - 09:37:15]
it like a traditional purely historical

[09:37:13 - 09:37:17]
purely the one that does not include a

[09:37:15 - 09:37:19]
lot of fancy stuff right you would have

[09:37:17 - 09:37:21]
the Heritage one right so that I have

[09:37:19 - 09:37:23]
not added in in the detailing if if I

[09:37:21 - 09:37:25]
would have added it would have given me

[09:37:23 - 09:37:27]
a much more Niche answer so exactly how

[09:37:25 - 09:37:30]

[09:40:33 - 09:40:36]
the story line should be compelling

[09:40:35 - 09:40:39]
enough so that is what it is telling me

[09:40:36 - 09:40:42]
then targeted uh advertising utilize the

[09:40:39 - 09:40:44]
Facebook Advanced targeting options to

[09:40:42 - 09:40:46]
reach a specific audience Define the

Target demographic based on your

[09:40:46 - 09:40:51]
location age interest so now it is

[09:40:49 - 09:40:54]
telling me that be targeted in your camp

[09:40:51 - 09:40:57]
right if you want a specific product

[09:40:54 - 09:41:00]
line of your brand to be focused on on

[09:40:57 - 09:41:02]
one specific demography let's say be it

[09:41:00 - 09:41:04]
people in the range of 60 to let's say

[09:41:02 - 09:41:06]
70 you would want to know their

[09:41:09 - 09:41:14]
be the significance of that and and and

[09:41:12 - 09:41:17]
you know Foster to that that needs

[09:41:14 - 09:41:18]
because at the end consumer comes to the

[09:41:17 - 09:41:20]
core of the business that you're doing

[09:41:18 - 09:41:23]
right now running the Facebook ads now

[09:41:20 - 09:41:25]
if I didn't not ask it that give me the

[09:41:23 - 09:41:27]
the ways organic ways if I would have

[09:41:25 - 09:41:29]
asked it would have not given me the ads

[09:41:27 - 09:41:31]
option in which I would have to spend

[09:41:29 - 09:41:33]
money right so you have to be very

[09:41:31 - 09:41:35]
careful in in writing these things it is

[09:41:33 - 09:41:38]
good that I know that Facebook ads now I

[09:41:35 - 09:41:40]
can I can pay uh for the ads to be

[09:41:38 - 09:41:43]
displayed right I could spend my

[09:41:40 - 09:41:45]
marketing budget in that in that regard

[09:41:43 - 09:41:47]
then influence collaborations I can you

[09:41:45 - 09:41:49]

[09:43:56 - 09:44:00]
business SS and a compelling and a

[09:43:57 - 09:44:02]
concise description of your brand then

[09:44:00 - 09:44:06]
it would be the cover photo and profile

[09:44:02 - 09:44:07]
page so it's giving me a step by step

[09:44:06 - 09:44:10]
things that I have to do right

[09:44:07 - 09:44:12]
consistent branding compelling about

[09:44:10 - 09:44:15]
about section right the about section in

[09:44:12 - 09:44:17]
the page should be crafted engaging

[09:44:15 - 09:44:19]
about how clearly it communicates the

[09:44:17 - 09:44:21]
Brand's Story Mission and unique selling

[09:44:19 - 09:44:23]
price so if for a lay man the these

[09:44:21 - 09:44:26]
terms may be a very fancy terms to look

[09:44:23 - 09:44:28]
at but at the end if you want to gain

[09:44:26 - 09:44:30]
that knowledge and want to implement it

[09:44:28 - 09:44:32]
right I may be a let's say software

[09:44:30 - 09:44:34]
developer but I I would not know much

[09:44:32 - 09:44:37]
about how the digital marketing space

[09:44:34 - 09:44:39]
works I would have to hire a person and

[09:44:37 - 09:44:41]
this is giving me all that in free most

[09:44:39 - 09:44:44]
of it right I can't say I I wouldn't say

[09:44:41 - 09:44:46]
that it can replace a digital marketer

[09:44:44 - 09:44:48]
it would still still give you a sense of

[09:44:46 - 09:44:50]
things what you need to work on right

[09:44:48 - 09:44:52]
the base of what you need to work on

if you are starting out right everybody

[09:44:54 - 09:44:57]
these days maybe want to be an

[09:44:55 - 09:44:59]

[09:44:57 - 09:45:01]
thing if you want to go in that regard

[09:44:59 - 09:45:04]

[09:45:04 - 09:45:08]
saying it is accurate I'm not saying

[09:45:05 - 09:45:10]
it's 100% correct I'm saying that most

[09:45:08 - 09:45:12]
of the things that you would want you

[09:45:10 - 09:45:14]
would get it over here 80% you have to

[09:45:12 - 09:45:17]
of course fact check it and and cross

[09:45:14 - 09:45:19]
verify a lot of things but 80% of your

[09:45:17 - 09:45:22]
job would be if you if you want to apply

[09:45:19 - 09:45:24]
the ptos principle the 20% things that

[09:45:22 - 09:45:26]

[09:45:36 - 09:45:39]
get that thing straight what you want

[09:45:37 - 09:45:41]
for your particular brand right now I

[09:45:39 - 09:45:43]
can also ask you that what are the most

[09:45:41 - 09:45:45]
effective Rays right we we talked about

[09:45:43 - 09:45:48]
the Facebook ads that it displayed me

[09:45:45 - 09:45:50]
now if I want to ask it in that regard

[09:45:48 - 09:45:52]
what are the most effective ways to run

[09:45:50 - 09:45:54]
targeted Facebook ads for the marketing

[09:45:52 - 09:45:57]
of a clothing brand now what would it

[09:45:54 - 09:45:59]
give me right it would give me that

[09:45:57 - 09:46:01]
Define the target audience you know we

[09:45:59 - 09:46:04]
we already talked about what the target

[09:46:01 - 09:46:06]
audience would be then custom audience

[09:46:04 - 09:46:09]
how how would the the location of that

[09:46:06 - 09:46:11]
targeting would be right ad creative

[09:46:09 - 09:46:14]
visuals compelling ads and call to

[09:46:11 - 09:46:16]
actions how to incl include those uh

[09:46:14 - 09:46:18]
call to action AB testing AB testing is

[09:46:16 - 09:46:20]
we'll talk about in in the email

[09:46:18 - 09:46:22]
marketing section I'll talk about what

[09:46:20 - 09:46:24]
these are but basically they have given

[09:46:22 - 09:46:26]
that to experiment on the various ad

[09:46:24 - 09:46:28]
variations that I want to you know uh

[09:46:26 - 09:46:30]
roll out right so I can just have an ad

[09:46:28 - 09:46:32]
test and rather than spending my

[09:46:30 - 09:46:35]
marketing money in in in fully fledged

[09:46:32 - 09:46:36]
campaign I can just AB test I can just

[09:46:35 - 09:46:38]
test it out if it is working or not if

[09:46:36 - 09:46:41]
it is working then I'll roll it out if

[09:46:38 - 09:46:44]
not then I won't so simple as that then

[09:46:41 - 09:46:45]
optimization and Analysis you know

[09:46:44 - 09:46:47]
continuously monitoring the performance

[09:46:45 - 09:46:50]
of the Facebook ads then tracking the

[09:46:47 - 09:46:52]
key Matrix like reach engagement click

[09:46:50 - 09:46:54]
through race conversion so all that

[09:46:52 - 09:46:56]
things can be done for for the brand

[09:46:54 - 09:46:59]
that I'm targeting so now what would

[09:46:56 - 09:47:00]
happen if I want to know about about

[09:46:59 - 09:47:02]
let's say Instagram right you would have

[09:47:00 - 09:47:05]
a lot of hashtags that are there right

[09:47:02 - 09:47:08]
so if I want to outreach my brand to the

[09:47:05 - 09:47:10]
level in which uh is clearly visible

[09:47:08 - 09:47:13]
every third person may heard of the name

[09:47:10 - 09:47:15]
of my brand so hashtags would be a

[09:47:13 - 09:47:17]
perfect way to start with right reals

[09:47:15 - 09:47:19]
hashtags right so since it's it's it

[09:47:17 - 09:47:21]
cannot it can give me real ideas by the

[09:47:19 - 09:47:24]
way so we can also run something on that

[09:47:21 - 09:47:25]
regard but if I want to add the search

[09:47:24 - 09:47:28]
volume hashtags that are there right for

[09:47:25 - 09:47:31]
a clothing brand to enhance my outre on

[09:47:28 - 09:47:33]
on another social media platform called

[09:47:31 - 09:47:35]
Instagram so let me see what what it

[09:47:33 - 09:47:35]
gives me

[09:47:36 - 09:47:41]
right so it knows that what would be the

[09:47:39 - 09:47:44]
most trending so what is search volume

[09:47:41 - 09:47:46]
so it's basically uh the thing that the

[09:47:44 - 09:47:49]
most people searched on on a search

[09:47:46 - 09:47:52]
engine right so that volume how much

[09:47:49 - 09:47:54]
people are are searching that fashion is

[09:47:52 - 09:47:57]
number one the keyword fashion comes

[09:47:54 - 09:48:01]
number one so these are the things that

[09:47:57 - 09:48:04]
I want to include in my brand when I

[09:48:01 - 09:48:06]
when when I'm posting out uh an insta

[09:48:04 - 09:48:08]
post a Facebook post or something on

[09:48:06 - 09:48:11]
that on a social media platform I would

[09:48:08 - 09:48:14]
want that these hashtags are there in

[09:48:11 - 09:48:17]
that post now this would give me a wide

[09:48:14 - 09:48:19]
wide you know consumer base on or or

[09:48:17 - 09:48:21]
maybe the visibility a lot of people

[09:48:19 - 09:48:24]
would probably see that because of the

[09:48:21 - 09:48:28]
hashtags use so this is why it is using

[09:48:24 - 09:48:32]
hashtags is important now I would want

[09:48:28 - 09:48:34]
to get my brand uh if I I want to make a

[09:48:32 - 09:48:36]
Content calendar right what I have to

[09:48:34 - 09:48:38]
post on these social media platforms

[09:48:36 - 09:48:40]
right so maybe I'll make a 30-day

[09:48:38 - 09:48:43]
calendar maybe I'll make a 15-day

[09:48:40 - 09:48:46]
calendar so I want to know what what are

[09:48:43 - 09:48:48]
the various captions I can put in those

[09:48:46 - 09:48:51]
particular post on every day let's say

[09:48:48 - 09:48:54]
uh 15 days from now I'm going going to

[09:48:51 - 09:48:56]
post about uh let's say a fashion line

[09:48:54 - 09:48:58]
that I'm going to introduce right a new

[09:48:56 - 09:49:00]
product line that I'm going to introduce

[09:48:58 - 09:49:02]
so how would that work that I'll just

[09:49:00 - 09:49:04]
ask it can you suggest some mind-blowing

[09:49:02 - 09:49:08]
captions for creating posts on Instagram

[09:49:04 - 09:49:10]
regarding the traditional wear right so

[09:49:08 - 09:49:12]
it would give me the various captions

[09:49:10 - 09:49:14]
that I can use now what I would do is I

[09:49:12 - 09:49:17]
would look at these I would ask them to

[09:49:14 - 09:49:20]
generate more I would look at these I'll

[09:49:17 - 09:49:22]
open up my Excel I'll just you know

[09:49:20 - 09:49:25]
write it down and make a calendar out of

[09:49:22 - 09:49:28]
it okay on 16th of August 15th of August

[09:49:25 - 09:49:30]
17th of August these are the things this

[09:49:28 - 09:49:32]
is what I'm going to post this is the

[09:49:30 - 09:49:34]
caption of that post so this is how you

[09:49:32 - 09:49:36]
make a Content calendar especially if

[09:49:34 - 09:49:39]
you want to be a content creator or if

[09:49:36 - 09:49:41]
you want to you know optimize how you

[09:49:39 - 09:49:43]
want to you roll out your post on social

[09:49:41 - 09:49:46]
medias this is the perfect way you can

[09:49:43 - 09:49:47]
just get those ideas get started with it

[09:49:46 - 09:49:50]
it may also be a scenario in which you

[09:49:47 - 09:49:52]
want to create a campaign right campaign

[09:49:50 - 09:49:54]
Market Mar plan for the clothing brand

[09:49:57 - 09:50:00]
the number of orders you would be

[09:49:58 - 09:50:02]
getting as a brand would be lot more

[09:50:00 - 09:50:04]
right so festive Seasons get a lot more

[09:50:02 - 09:50:06]
orders right so you have to be prepared

[09:50:04 - 09:50:08]
for that as well right so and also how

[09:50:17 - 09:50:22]
what needs to be done way before uh New

[09:50:19 - 09:50:25]
Year comes right so it gives me that

[09:50:33 - 09:50:37]
need to work around with now I can be

[09:50:35 - 09:50:38]
much more Niche and ask them much more

[09:50:37 - 09:50:41]
different questions regarding to what

[09:50:38 - 09:50:43]
they have asked or I can just build it

[09:50:41 - 09:50:46]
up from where how I want it to build

[09:50:43 - 09:50:48]
right now since our target audience uh

[09:50:46 - 09:50:52]
is in India right we we mentioned that

[09:50:48 - 09:50:55]
the demography that uh the the the scape

[09:50:52 - 09:50:58]
that we'll be targeting is is in India

[09:50:55 - 09:51:00]
so the the Festival Key Festival in

[09:50:58 - 09:51:04]
India let's say uh just take a random

[09:51:00 - 09:51:06]
guess would be either Eid or Diwali or

[09:51:04 - 09:51:07]
or or a lot of different festivals that

[09:51:06 - 09:51:10]
come up right so let's just take an

[09:51:07 - 09:51:11]
example of Diwali and let's say write a

[09:51:10 - 09:51:14]
gratitude letter to be sent to a regular

[09:51:11 - 09:51:17]
customers on Diwali right that I bought

[09:51:14 - 09:51:19]
my traditional wear right now I want to

[09:51:17 - 09:51:21]
also because I want to retain those

[09:51:19 - 09:51:23]
customers right I want them to keep

[09:51:21 - 09:51:26]
shopping from my brand so I would want

[09:51:23 - 09:51:30]
them to now this is what chpd is based

[09:51:26 - 09:51:32]
at right it gives it makes tailor made

[09:51:30 - 09:51:35]
letters to customers as well if you know

[09:51:32 - 09:51:37]
what that customer is so it would give

[09:51:35 - 09:51:38]
me a well-written letter out of it so

[09:51:37 - 09:51:40]
let's just read it out Dear valued

[09:51:38 - 09:51:42]
customer on this joyous occasion of

[09:51:40 - 09:51:45]
Diwali we wanted to make take a moment

[09:51:42 - 09:51:48]
to express a heartfelt gratitude for the

[09:51:45 - 09:51:50]
continued support of us and as the as

[09:51:48 - 09:51:52]
the Festival of Lies your loyalty and

[09:51:50 - 09:51:53]
Trust in the clo clothing brand then you

[09:51:52 - 09:51:56]
can talk about it is because the

[09:51:53 - 09:51:59]
customers like you that we are inspired

[09:51:56 - 09:52:02]
to continuously innovate and strive for

[09:51:59 - 09:52:04]
excellence now what this is doing is

[09:52:02 - 09:52:07]
also giving a feedback of digital

[09:52:04 - 09:52:10]
marketing in this right it would also

[09:52:07 - 09:52:12]
refine the way the customer perceives us

[09:52:10 - 09:52:15]
right if you receive a tailor made let's

[09:52:12 - 09:52:18]
say a tailor made gratitude later for

[09:52:15 - 09:52:20]
being a regular customer that would also

[09:52:18 - 09:52:23]
create that kind of bond between the

[09:52:20 - 09:52:25]
brand and the consumer that's exactly

[09:52:23 - 09:52:27]
what what it needs to be so now it has

[09:52:25 - 09:52:30]
made now if I want to I don't want this

[09:52:27 - 09:52:32]
I want something else I don't want same

[09:52:30 - 09:52:34]
to be sent I can regenerate response

[09:52:32 - 09:52:35]
right now this is a fairly shorter

[09:52:34 - 09:52:38]
prompt but you can also add

[09:52:35 - 09:52:40]
customizations to it right you can in

[09:52:38 - 09:52:42]
fact you can add customization for each

[09:52:40 - 09:52:45]
if you're starting out you would have a

[09:52:42 - 09:52:47]
lot lesser uh lesser customers that you

[09:52:45 - 09:52:49]
engage in so you can also have much more

[09:52:47 - 09:52:51]
tailor made gratitude letters for them

[09:52:49 - 09:52:53]
if you know how they order what are

[09:52:51 - 09:52:56]
their fashion SES then this can be done

[09:52:53 - 09:52:58]
as well right so if I regenerate

[09:52:56 - 09:53:01]
response I would get okay so I could

[09:52:58 - 09:53:03]
view the one that is here so if 2 by two

[09:53:01 - 09:53:06]
it shows here I can go back I see the

[09:53:03 - 09:53:09]
First Response the second response right

[09:53:06 - 09:53:11]
so this is what wishing radiant and a

[09:53:09 - 09:53:14]
dis Diwali so all these things can be

[09:53:11 - 09:53:16]
done on chbt you would not need to hire

[09:53:14 - 09:53:19]
uh an external person so consider this

Layman I would not know what email

[09:53:42 - 09:53:47]

[09:53:44 - 09:53:50]
regard that I would have to give it's

basically like how a baby learns ABCD if

point mean so it would give me okay the

customers attention for my brand right

[09:57:22 - 09:57:26]

[09:57:25 - 09:57:29]
inside now these are the things that you

[09:57:26 - 09:57:31]
normally see as well right so now this

[09:57:29 - 09:57:32]
is now you would not have to go and

[09:57:31 - 09:57:34]
search around okay what what are my

[09:57:32 - 09:57:35]
competitors doing what should I how

[09:57:34 - 09:57:38]
should I look about it how should I set

[09:57:35 - 09:57:39]
up my marketing campaigns right so now

it has given me those subject lines to

[09:57:39 - 09:57:43]
grab those attention as well right now

[09:57:41 - 09:57:46]
limited time only you can have it right

[09:57:43 - 09:57:48]
so I've added I catchy statement over

[09:57:46 - 09:57:50]
here right so this is a keyword in the

[09:57:48 - 09:57:51]
prompt that I'm providing it that that

[09:57:50 - 09:57:53]
you know it has to be something that is

[09:57:51 - 09:57:56]
very catchy

[09:57:53 - 09:57:59]
because okay in in in a normal base it

[09:57:56 - 09:58:02]
is only one or 2% that your emails would

[09:57:59 - 09:58:04]
be even opened for that matter right so

[09:58:02 - 09:58:07]
it has to be very very catchy in terms

[09:58:04 - 09:58:09]
of the in terms of the subject lines

[09:58:07 - 09:58:11]
right so you can give it a give it a

[09:58:09 - 09:58:14]
look on which one is which seems more

[09:58:11 - 09:58:16]
catchy to you you can add that in your

[09:58:14 - 09:58:19]
ma gy in your a testing and test it out

[09:58:16 - 09:58:21]
if it works so this is how you can add

[09:58:19 - 09:58:23]
things now this is where charge is very

[09:58:21 - 09:58:26]
good at that it can add a lot more

[09:58:23 - 09:58:27]
things right so one other way what we

[09:58:26 - 09:58:29]
can do is that let's just give it a

[09:58:27 - 09:58:32]
scenario right could you write a cold

[09:58:29 - 09:58:34]
email to persuade a potential customer

[09:58:32 - 09:58:38]
who is interested in buying let's say a

[09:58:34 - 09:58:41]
sar in a funky way right now I want that

[09:58:38 - 09:58:42]
customer who probably has a s in their

[09:58:41 - 09:58:44]
cart right they would sign up in the

[09:58:42 - 09:58:46]
website they would have something in the

[09:58:44 - 09:58:48]
card that you can track right so you

[09:58:46 - 09:58:50]
could write a cold email to persuade

[09:58:48 - 09:58:52]
that customer who is interested in

[09:58:50 - 09:58:55]
buying a s in a funky way now let's just

[09:58:52 - 09:58:58]
see what it gives it's a very very good

[09:58:55 - 09:59:00]
structured uh question prompt right now

[09:58:58 - 09:59:03]
it would give you a very you know

[09:59:00 - 09:59:05]
customized number one thing is talking

[09:59:03 - 09:59:08]
about India so it starts with Namaste or

[09:59:05 - 09:59:10]
whatever so what resonates more you

[09:59:08 - 09:59:12]
would write it down now we hope this

[09:59:10 - 09:59:14]
email finds you in High Spirits and

[09:59:12 - 09:59:16]
assist for embracing your Unique Style

[09:59:14 - 09:59:19]
right we couldn't help but notice your

[09:59:16 - 09:59:21]
interest in sis now you could also add

[09:59:19 - 09:59:25]
that that customers who interested in

[09:59:21 - 09:59:26]
buying SAR and has the SAR in their cart

[09:59:25 - 09:59:28]
right you can add it in in the brackets

[09:59:26 - 09:59:31]
it will understand so it will add that

[09:59:28 - 09:59:33]
in this component of of the email that

[09:59:31 - 09:59:36]
it is there right now subject light

[09:59:33 - 09:59:38]
Unleash Your s s swag get funky with

[09:59:36 - 09:59:40]
vibrant collection so it gives a a

[09:59:38 - 09:59:43]
variety of different you know subject

[09:59:40 - 09:59:45]
lines that that are very catchy right so

[09:59:43 - 09:59:47]
you can build all that from here right

[09:59:45 - 09:59:49]
again you would not need another digital

[09:59:47 - 09:59:51]
marketer to do this you don't have to

[09:59:49 - 09:59:54]
pay anyone else it just does it for you

[09:59:51 - 09:59:56]
so another variation that we can think

[09:59:54 - 09:59:59]
of is that if you could write a cold

[09:59:56 - 10:00:01]
email from a clothing brand targeting

[09:59:59 - 10:00:04]
elderly people right now they would not

[10:00:01 - 10:00:06]
want that kind of funky things that s

[10:00:04 - 10:00:08]
swag and all that was mentioned in the

[10:00:06 - 10:00:11]
previous email so it would give me that

[10:00:08 - 10:00:14]
Timeless Elegance for your young at

[10:00:11 - 10:00:16]
heart discover a collection right so it

[10:00:14 - 10:00:18]
wants to make the elderly feel that

[10:00:16 - 10:00:20]
you're young it doesn't matter if you

[10:00:18 - 10:00:22]
the number says it is Young at heart

[10:00:20 - 10:00:24]
right so it has given me that kind it's

[10:00:22 - 10:00:26]
such a beautiful such a fantastic thing

[10:00:24 - 10:00:29]
to do right so this is the potential

[10:00:26 - 10:00:32]
that chart GPD has it can structure your

[10:00:29 - 10:00:33]
things in such a way that could also

[10:00:32 - 10:00:35]
give you a very very good look your

[10:00:33 - 10:00:38]

[10:00:41 - 10:00:45]
whole Crux is about whole Buzz how you

[10:00:43 - 10:00:48]
can optimize now this is the moment in

[10:00:45 - 10:00:50]
which you really want your brand to go

[10:00:48 - 10:00:52]
ahead of others right you have to have

[10:00:50 - 10:00:55]

[10:00:52 - 10:00:57]

[10:01:08 - 10:01:13]
you can have a lot of variations in it

[10:01:10 - 10:01:15]
for absolutely every demographic way you

[10:01:13 - 10:01:17]
want you can have it done through chat

[10:01:15 - 10:01:19]
gbd now let's try to focus on the

[10:01:17 - 10:01:22]
customer feedback right so if I have a

[10:01:19 - 10:01:26]
and now I would I would want the

[10:01:22 - 10:01:29]
customers to give me positive negative

[10:01:26 - 10:01:32]
feedbacks of how my show me the reality

[10:01:29 - 10:01:34]
of how my brand is is behaving how does

[10:01:32 - 10:01:37]
it look like to to a normal customer to

[10:01:34 - 10:01:39]
a custom unbi customer right so how does

[10:01:37 - 10:01:41]
it look like right so we would

[10:01:39 - 10:01:44]
understand to generate these customer

[10:01:41 - 10:01:46]
feedback forms understand what goes into

[10:01:44 - 10:01:49]
customer feedback now let's just type in

[10:01:46 - 10:01:49]
our prompts

[10:01:53 - 10:01:56]
so the first prompt that I would be

[10:01:54 - 10:01:59]
asking is what are the different ways to

[10:01:56 - 10:02:02]
take a customer feedback on a product

[10:01:59 - 10:02:05]
they bought from our site now remember

[10:02:02 - 10:02:07]
that I am a lay man in terms of digital

[10:02:05 - 10:02:09]
marketing I have absolutely no clue what

[10:02:07 - 10:02:11]
is happening in digital marketing domain

[10:02:09 - 10:02:13]
so what would I need I would want chat

[10:02:11 - 10:02:15]
gb2 to tell me that what are the

[10:02:13 - 10:02:17]
different ways I can get that customer

[10:02:15 - 10:02:19]
feedback right from the products that

[10:02:17 - 10:02:22]
they have bought online right so let

[10:02:19 - 10:02:22]
let's look

[10:02:37 - 10:02:42]
at so the online survey now send out the

[10:02:40 - 10:02:44]
online surveys to customers after they

[10:02:42 - 10:02:46]
have made a purchase you can use tools

[10:02:44 - 10:02:48]
like Survey Monkey or Google forms again

[10:02:46 - 10:02:50]
do not look at this part because this

[10:02:48 - 10:02:53]
may be outdated you can do your research

[10:02:50 - 10:02:56]
on the tools that are there right then

[10:02:53 - 10:02:58]
basically setting up a or online survey

[10:02:56 - 10:02:59]
right number two is the email requests

[10:02:58 - 10:03:01]
right reach out to the customers by

[10:02:59 - 10:03:03]
email and request their feedback then it

[10:03:01 - 10:03:06]
would be the product review right how do

[10:03:49 - 10:03:53]
ways in which I can gather that feedback

[10:03:51 - 10:03:56]
from the customer now would want them to

[10:03:53 - 10:03:58]
create me one right so I've added create

[10:03:56 - 10:04:00]
a customer feedback form for the

[10:03:58 - 10:04:01]
customers who have bought the products

[10:04:17 - 10:04:22]
feedback how do you like it in maybe I

[10:04:20 - 10:04:24]

[10:04:22 - 10:04:27]
maybe ratings from 1 to five so I can do

[10:04:24 - 10:04:28]
that but different ways of parameters

[10:04:27 - 10:04:30]
were you satisfied with the customer

[10:04:28 - 10:04:32]

[10:04:30 - 10:04:34]
customer support team respond promptly

[10:04:32 - 10:04:35]
to your inquiries or concern now just

[10:04:34 - 10:04:37]
imagine that when you are starting out

[10:04:35 - 10:04:39]
your company when you're starting out

[10:04:37 - 10:04:40]
the company from the base you do not

[10:04:39 - 10:04:43]
have a lot of capital involved to hire

[10:04:40 - 10:04:45]
people right this becomes your ultimate

[10:04:43 - 10:04:47]
guide this becomes your ultimate tool

[10:04:45 - 10:04:49]
that would help you that is for free

[10:04:47 - 10:04:51]
right so use this now this is much more

[10:04:49 - 10:04:53]
as you can see that this is much more

[10:04:51 - 10:04:55]
qualitative in right you do not have a

[10:04:53 - 10:04:58]
rating scale involved in it now what if

[10:04:55 - 10:05:01]
I just want them to I want to make me a

[10:04:58 - 10:05:02]
rating scale as well right with the with

[10:05:01 - 10:05:05]
more quantitative questions than

[10:05:02 - 10:05:08]
qualitative questions then I would add

[10:05:05 - 10:05:10]
can you use more quantitative questions

[10:05:08 - 10:05:12]
in the above form because I want to

[10:05:10 - 10:05:14]
quantify the results right now at the

[10:05:12 - 10:05:16]
end I would have to analyze that data

[10:05:14 - 10:05:18]
where in which field is is my brand

[10:05:16 - 10:05:21]
lagging behind right based on the

[10:05:18 - 10:05:24]
customers that that that that are there

[10:05:21 - 10:05:26]
right so in this I will get certainly

[10:05:24 - 10:05:27]
here's the updated version of form now

[10:05:26 - 10:05:29]
you would also get one being the

[10:05:27 - 10:05:32]
dissatisfied 10 mean the highest

[10:05:29 - 10:05:36]
satisfied right I can also ask

[10:05:32 - 10:05:39]
it to add more questions also let me try

[10:05:36 - 10:05:41]
it out can you

[10:05:39 - 10:05:46]
make the

[10:05:41 - 10:05:48]
form in a table for MCH they just ask a

[10:05:46 - 10:05:51]
doubt because it's very qualitative I

[10:05:48 - 10:05:54]
can't really see it you've just added 1

[10:05:51 - 10:05:56]
to 10 how do I add it more right so now

[10:05:54 - 10:05:58]
it has given me updated version of the

[10:05:56 - 10:06:02]
table format right so it has given me in

[10:05:58 - 10:06:04]
a much more table format right you can

[10:06:02 - 10:06:06]
copy paste it add it into the rating

[10:06:04 - 10:06:10]
scales right it would not it is not much

[10:06:06 - 10:06:13]
more accurate in that regard but yeah it

[10:06:10 - 10:06:13]
certainly does the work

[10:06:21 - 10:06:26]
right now this this is a much more

[10:06:24 - 10:06:28]
accurate way of of doing it rather than

[10:06:26 - 10:06:31]
the previous one so this one looks much

[10:06:28 - 10:06:34]
more clearer in that

[10:06:31 - 10:06:36]
regard okay now if I want them to add

[10:06:34 - 10:06:39]
more questions to it they would do that

[10:06:36 - 10:06:41]
right now it has known that I want it in

[10:06:39 - 10:06:44]
a table format it would again go back

[10:06:41 - 10:06:45]
and and just make it in a table format I

[10:06:44 - 10:06:47]
don't have to input that give it in a

[10:06:45 - 10:06:49]
table format it already knows now right

[10:06:47 - 10:06:51]
now if I have to change that then I have

[10:06:49 - 10:06:53]
to give it a problem that please change

[10:06:51 - 10:06:55]

with the our Personal Finance Management

[10:08:27 - 10:08:33]

[10:08:30 - 10:08:36]
question how can I balance my shortterm

[10:08:33 - 10:08:38]
and long-term Financial goal so this is

[10:08:36 - 10:08:42]
very very important for an individual

[10:08:38 - 10:08:45]
correct so we need to make a goal like

[10:08:42 - 10:08:48]
first short-term and longterm so if you

[10:08:45 - 10:08:51]
are earning 10,000 rupees as a salary it

[10:08:48 - 10:08:54]
is an example okay so in the 10,000 how

[10:08:51 - 10:08:57]
I can make short-term Financial goal and

[10:08:54 - 10:09:01]
how can I make my long-term Financial

[10:08:57 - 10:09:02]
goal so short-term goals for example

[10:09:01 - 10:09:05]
this month what are the household

[10:09:02 - 10:09:08]
expenses are there or this month I need

[10:09:05 - 10:09:10]
to pay my son's educational fees or

[10:09:08 - 10:09:12]
tuition fees or whatever the dancing

[10:09:10 - 10:09:15]
class or whatever the other expenses are

[10:09:12 - 10:09:17]
that are my short-term goals if I come

[10:09:15 - 10:09:20]
for a long-term goal for example

[10:09:17 - 10:09:22]
long-term goals like I need to purchase

[10:09:20 - 10:09:25]
one motor vehicle or I need to purchase

[10:09:22 - 10:09:28]
a car or I need to purchase one land and

[10:09:25 - 10:09:31]
building so that are my long-term goals

[10:09:28 - 10:09:34]
correct so how we need to plan so here

[10:09:31 - 10:09:37]
are some suggestions are there so we'll

[10:09:34 - 10:09:38]
see one by one so balancing short-term

[10:09:37 - 10:09:41]
and long-term financial goals is an

[10:09:38 - 10:09:44]
important part of financial planning so

[10:09:41 - 10:09:46]
we need to segregate our first planning

[10:09:44 - 10:09:49]
so which are our short-term goals or

[10:09:46 - 10:09:52]
which are our long-term goal so after

[10:09:49 - 10:09:56]
that but you need to plan okay so first

[10:09:52 - 10:10:00]
set clear financial goals so financial

[10:09:56 - 10:10:03]
goals is nothing but what is we need to

[10:10:00 - 10:10:05]
achieve or what I need to get that is

[10:10:03 - 10:10:09]
our goal correct so if I want to

[10:10:05 - 10:10:12]
purchase bike after 2 years so that is

[10:10:09 - 10:10:14]
my goal I need to purchase a bike that

[10:10:12 - 10:10:16]
is long term shortterm I need to pay my

[10:10:14 - 10:10:19]
son's educational fees that is the

[10:10:16 - 10:10:21]
shortterm so first we need to set a

[10:10:19 - 10:10:25]
clear financial goals that is our first

[10:10:21 - 10:10:28]
step second prioritize your

[10:10:25 - 10:10:31]
goals so in shortterm I already told you

[10:10:28 - 10:10:34]
like pay the rent or pay the electricity

[10:10:31 - 10:10:36]
bill or son's educational fees or

[10:10:34 - 10:10:39]
whatever the household expenses are

[10:10:36 - 10:10:42]
there or we need to purchase some cloths

[10:10:39 - 10:10:46]
correct so in that we need to set a

[10:10:42 - 10:10:49]
priority which is very necessity for us

[10:10:46 - 10:10:51]
or which is very priority is there

[10:10:49 - 10:10:53]
okay which are least priority is there

[10:10:51 - 10:10:57]
so according to that we need to plan so

[10:10:53 - 10:10:59]
first one house rent okay we need to pay

[10:10:57 - 10:11:01]
rent correct so that is our first

[10:10:59 - 10:11:04]
priority second one we need to pay

[10:11:01 - 10:11:06]
electricity bill and third one is we

[10:11:04 - 10:11:09]
need to pay Sun educational tuition fees

[10:11:06 - 10:11:12]
correct that is also very priority or

[10:11:09 - 10:11:14]
high priority so like that we need to

[10:11:12 - 10:11:16]
make the priority which is the first

[10:11:14 - 10:11:19]
second third priorities are there we

[10:11:16 - 10:11:21]
need to set the priorities according to

[10:11:19 - 10:11:23]
our goal and when it comes to longterm I

[10:11:21 - 10:11:25]
need to purchase bike after 2 years

[10:11:23 - 10:11:28]
correct so for that also I need to save

[10:11:25 - 10:11:30]
some money for example in the 10,000 at

[10:11:28 - 10:11:33]
least 10% of the value that is 1,000

[10:11:30 - 10:11:36]
rupees every month I need to save for my

[10:11:33 - 10:11:40]
future goal or for my longterm goal that

[10:11:36 - 10:11:42]
is how we need to plan next create a

[10:11:40 - 10:11:45]
budget so you know the meaning of budget

[10:11:42 - 10:11:48]
right so budget is nothing but it is the

[10:11:45 - 10:11:51]
estimation of your inflow and outflow of

[10:11:48 - 10:11:52]
cash so how much revenue or how much

[10:11:51 - 10:11:55]
profit you are going to get for that

[10:11:52 - 10:11:58]
particular month or particular year and

[10:11:55 - 10:12:00]
how much I need to spend that is what is

[10:11:58 - 10:12:02]
your expected expenses for that

[10:12:00 - 10:12:06]
particular month or for the particular

[10:12:02 - 10:12:09]
year so that you need to create a budget

[10:12:06 - 10:12:13]
for your personal finance and the fourth

[10:12:09 - 10:12:14]
one build an emergency fund so all your

[10:12:13 - 10:12:17]
companies also they are going to keep

[10:12:14 - 10:12:20]
the reservations that is reserves and

[10:12:17 - 10:12:22]
surplus correct so why they are going to

[10:12:20 - 10:12:26]
keep the reserves so we can't predict

[10:12:22 - 10:12:29]
the future like how the covid hit

[10:12:26 - 10:12:32]
correct so all the finance it may be for

[10:12:29 - 10:12:34]
personal finance or companies everyone

[10:12:32 - 10:12:37]
they're affected with this covid correct

[10:12:34 - 10:12:40]
in that scenario we require some

[10:12:37 - 10:12:44]
reserves okay so that is the reason as a

[10:12:40 - 10:12:45]
individual as a person we need to make a

[10:12:44 - 10:12:47]
reserve for our

[10:12:45 - 10:12:49]
future okay whatever the uncertainities

[10:12:47 - 10:12:51]
are there so what whatever the

[10:12:49 - 10:12:56]
emergencies will be there so for that we

[10:12:51 - 10:12:59]
need to create some money next save for

[10:12:56 - 10:13:03]
retirement okay for example now I'm 28

[10:12:59 - 10:13:06]
years okay so at what age I can

[10:13:03 - 10:13:11]
work up to 58 or 60 years correct so

[10:13:06 - 10:13:14]
after 60 years what is my financial

[10:13:11 - 10:13:16]
plans that is a big question correct so

[10:13:14 - 10:13:18]
if you are going to earn now yes you are

[10:13:16 - 10:13:19]
going to spend after 60 years who is

[10:13:18 - 10:13:22]
going to spend

[10:13:19 - 10:13:24]
or who is going to give money correct so

[10:13:22 - 10:13:27]
for that we need to plan for our

[10:13:24 - 10:13:31]
retirement also so in our retirement how

[10:13:27 - 10:13:35]
we need to okay so consider a financial

[10:13:31 - 10:13:39]
planner okay so this Char GPT work as a

[10:15:19 - 10:15:24]
so ultimately we need to reduce our

[10:15:22 - 10:15:26]
expenses correct so if we reduce our

[10:15:24 - 10:15:29]
expenses then we can increase our

[10:15:26 - 10:15:32]
whatever the incomes for example if I as

[10:15:29 - 10:15:34]
the last example 10,000 is my salary so

[10:15:32 - 10:15:37]
in that 10,000 only I need to save more

[10:15:34 - 10:15:39]
money so what are the strategies I need

[10:15:37 - 10:15:40]
to do or what are the ways are there so

[10:15:39 - 10:15:45]
in that first

[10:15:40 - 10:15:47]
one create a budget reduce housing cost

[10:15:45 - 10:15:48]
so that is unnecessary

[10:15:47 - 10:15:51]
expenses sometimes what you are going

[10:15:48 - 10:15:53]
going to do it is not required some

[10:15:51 - 10:15:54]
extent it is not required but also what

[10:15:53 - 10:15:57]
we are going to do we are going to

[10:15:54 - 10:16:00]
invest my money or our money in that

[10:15:57 - 10:16:03]
particular thing it may be purchasing of

[10:16:00 - 10:16:06]
XYZ equipment or purchasing of luxury

[10:16:03 - 10:16:08]
Furnitures or whatever the other things

[10:16:06 - 10:16:10]
are there unnecessarily we are going to

[10:16:08 - 10:16:14]
invest our money so that we can reduce

[10:16:10 - 10:16:16]
that is in control of our hand only that

[10:16:14 - 10:16:19]
is in the control LEL correct so on that

[10:16:16 - 10:16:22]
time we can reduce the expenses so we

[10:16:19 - 10:16:25]
can increase our income or increase our

[10:16:22 - 10:16:27]
earnings or savings correct so that is

[10:16:25 - 10:16:30]
one strategy next cut back on

[10:16:27 - 10:16:33]
Transportation cost unnecessary

[10:16:30 - 10:16:36]
traveling if required then only if you

[10:16:33 - 10:16:38]
are going to go to that pleas otherwise

[10:16:36 - 10:16:40]
sometimes what we are going to do

[10:16:38 - 10:16:41]
unnecessary we are going to spend on the

[10:16:40 - 10:16:43]
transportation if you're are using

[10:16:41 - 10:16:45]
public service or your own

[10:16:43 - 10:16:47]
transportation for own transportation

[10:16:45 - 10:16:49]
also we need to spend on fuil and other

[10:16:47 - 10:16:50]
things correct and public transportation

[10:16:49 - 10:16:52]
also we need to pay for whatever the

[10:16:50 - 10:16:54]
fair charges are there that we need to

[10:16:52 - 10:16:57]
pay and we are going to spend money

[10:16:54 - 10:16:59]
correct so we can reduce in this way

[10:16:57 - 10:17:03]
also that is cut back on Transportation

[10:16:59 - 10:17:06]
cost or if it is necessary instead of

[10:17:03 - 10:17:08]
using your personal vehicles we can use

[10:17:06 - 10:17:11]
our public transportation also so for

[10:17:08 - 10:17:14]
example from a place to Z place if I

[10:17:11 - 10:17:17]
want to go with my personal vehicle then

[10:17:14 - 10:17:19]
I need to spend 1,000 rupees for the

[10:17:17 - 10:17:22]
same a place to Z place if I use this

[10:17:19 - 10:17:25]
public transportation then I can spend

[10:17:22 - 10:17:27]
only 100 rupees so in this we can save

[10:17:25 - 10:17:29]
900 rupees correct so that is one

[10:17:27 - 10:17:34]
strategy to

[10:17:29 - 10:17:37]
reduce next shop smarter next cut back

[10:17:34 - 10:17:41]
on eating out so whatever the outside

[10:17:37 - 10:17:44]
foods reduce entertainment expenses so

[10:17:41 - 10:17:46]
whatever the entertainment we are going

[10:17:44 - 10:17:49]
to spend reduce on that so these are the

[10:17:46 - 10:17:52]
few reducing expenses strategies chat

[10:17:49 - 10:17:55]

[10:17:55 - 10:18:00]

[10:18:09 - 10:18:17]
for our work and next start aside aals

[10:18:14 - 10:18:19]

[10:18:17 - 10:18:22]
business or freelancing to us additional

[10:18:19 - 10:18:24]
income whenever the free times is there

[10:18:22 - 10:18:27]
on that time whatever the feasible work

[10:18:24 - 10:18:29]
or whatever the work we can do or we are

[10:18:27 - 10:18:32]
good in that work so on that time we can

[10:18:29 - 10:18:35]
do this freelancing rent out space or

[10:18:32 - 10:18:37]
monetize your hobbies sell items you no

[10:18:35 - 10:18:40]
longer needed so these are all the few

[10:18:37 - 10:18:43]
strategies we can do and we can increase

[10:18:40 - 10:18:46]
our income so these are all the

[10:18:43 - 10:18:49]
suggestions given by the chat GPT for

[10:18:46 - 10:18:52]
how to reduce our expenses and increase

[10:18:49 - 10:18:56]
our incomes next how can I prioritize

[10:18:52 - 10:18:58]
and manage my debt effectively everyone

[10:18:56 - 10:19:01]
having this debt correct so either

[10:18:58 - 10:19:03]
credit cards or loans personal loan

[10:19:01 - 10:19:05]
educational loan or housing loan we are

[10:19:03 - 10:19:09]
going to go through with this loans only

[10:19:05 - 10:19:12]
or debts correct so how we can maintain

[10:19:09 - 10:19:16]
effectively so here are few suggestions

[10:19:12 - 10:19:19]
given by the CH GPT so first one list

[10:19:16 - 10:19:22]
all your debts so first we need to leas

[10:19:19 - 10:19:24]
the debts that is which are all the loan

[10:19:22 - 10:19:28]
or whichever are the credit I have taken

[10:19:24 - 10:19:32]
so first we need to make the list second

[10:19:28 - 10:19:35]
prioritize your debts if for example I

[10:19:32 - 10:19:39]
have a personal loan so first we need to

[10:19:35 - 10:19:43]
look at the interest rates correct so if

[10:19:39 - 10:19:46]
you want to go to taking a loan okay for

[10:19:43 - 10:19:48]
whatever the reason okay so for that we

[10:19:46 - 10:19:50]
need to check the interest rates as a

[10:19:48 - 10:19:52]
common public we are going to do correct

[10:19:50 - 10:19:55]
so if for example SBI is offering the

[10:19:52 - 10:19:58]
loan HDFC is offering loan or any other

[10:19:55 - 10:20:00]
Banks they are going to offer a loan

[10:19:58 - 10:20:02]
correct so first we are going to check

[10:20:00 - 10:20:05]
which bank is going to offer how much

[10:20:02 - 10:20:08]
interest rates or which is offering for

[10:20:05 - 10:20:10]
least rate of interest correct we are

[10:20:08 - 10:20:12]
going to check and which is charging

[10:20:10 - 10:20:14]
less processing charges everything we

[10:20:12 - 10:20:17]
need to check correct so here also this

[10:20:14 - 10:20:19]
CH AP is given the same strategy or

[10:20:17 - 10:20:21]
suggestion so so first we need to

[10:20:19 - 10:20:24]
prioritize your debts based on the

[10:20:21 - 10:20:26]
interest rates and the balances correct

[10:20:24 - 10:20:28]
so we need to check the which are all

[10:20:26 - 10:20:29]
the I least interest rates are there

[10:20:28 - 10:20:33]
okay according to that we need to

[10:20:29 - 10:20:37]
prioritize and next make a plan develop

[10:20:33 - 10:20:40]
a plan for paying of your debts so after

[10:20:37 - 10:20:42]
that we need to prioritize or we need to

[10:20:40 - 10:20:45]
make a plan of paying the debts or we

[10:20:42 - 10:20:49]
need to redeem the debt or repayment of

[10:20:45 - 10:20:52]
debts next negotiate with with creditors

[10:20:49 - 10:20:55]
so creditors is nothing but one who

[10:20:52 - 10:20:57]
gives the money or ones who given the

[10:20:55 - 10:21:00]
products or services on the basis of

[10:20:57 - 10:21:03]
credit creditors is nothing but for whom

[10:21:00 - 10:21:06]
we Wes to others or Wes to other party

[10:21:03 - 10:21:08]
that is the creditors so this creditors

[10:21:06 - 10:21:12]
may be your Banker or any financial

[10:21:08 - 10:21:15]
institution or private party okay so we

[10:21:12 - 10:21:17]
need to negotiate with them okay if for

[10:21:15 - 10:21:20]
example if the private person if they're

[10:21:17 - 10:21:22]
going to offer a loan for 10% we are not

[10:21:20 - 10:21:25]
going to accept for 10% correct so we

[10:21:22 - 10:21:26]
need to negotiate at least for 8% that

[10:21:25 - 10:21:31]
is the

[10:21:26 - 10:21:33]
negotiate avoid taking on new debt so

[10:21:31 - 10:21:36]
simply if you require money go for a

[10:21:33 - 10:21:39]
loan that is also bad habit increase

[10:21:36 - 10:21:41]
your income so earlier also we have

[10:21:39 - 10:21:44]
discussed no so in the free time we can

[10:21:41 - 10:21:46]
do freelancing or whichever is paying

[10:21:44 - 10:21:50]
the good or reasonable salary for your

[10:21:46 - 10:21:53]
work that kind of incomes we need to

[10:21:50 - 10:21:57]
get create a

[10:21:53 - 10:21:59]
budget seek professional help so if you

[10:21:57 - 10:22:01]
are struggling to manage your debt

[10:21:59 - 10:22:04]
consider seeking help from financial

[10:22:01 - 10:22:07]
adviser or credit consoler so whatever

[10:22:04 - 10:22:08]
the suggestions given by chat GPT after

[10:22:07 - 10:22:10]
that also if you require some other

[10:22:08 - 10:22:14]
suggestions then you can go with the

[10:22:10 - 10:22:16]
advisory functions all your Bankers or

[10:22:14 - 10:22:19]
commercial Banks private Banks they are

[10:22:16 - 10:22:22]

the chat GP let us discuss about pension

[10:22:45 - 10:22:50]
or pension scheme or after the

[10:22:47 - 10:22:53]
retirement what is the future or how we

[10:22:50 - 10:22:56]
need to maintain for our medical bills

[10:22:53 - 10:22:58]
or financial whatever the commitments

[10:22:56 - 10:23:00]
will be there correct so for day-to-day

[10:22:58 - 10:23:02]
expenses we require money so we'll see

[10:23:00 - 10:23:05]
we'll ask few questions on the

[10:23:02 - 10:23:07]
retirement and pensions my first query

[10:23:05 - 10:23:10]
is what are the key factors to consider

[10:23:07 - 10:23:12]
when planning for retirement if for

[10:23:10 - 10:23:14]
example after 10 years or 15 years I'm

[10:23:12 - 10:23:19]
going to retire or I'm planning to

[10:23:14 - 10:23:21]
retire correct so how we need to or what

[10:23:19 - 10:23:24]
are the factors we need to consider when

[10:23:21 - 10:23:28]
we go for a or when we planning for a

[10:23:24 - 10:23:30]
retirement chpt will give few

[10:23:28 - 10:23:32]
suggestions or advises what are the key

[10:23:30 - 10:23:34]
factors we need to keep it in our mind

[10:23:32 - 10:23:37]
and then we need to plan for our

[10:23:34 - 10:23:40]
retirement after 15 years or after 20

[10:23:37 - 10:23:43]
years correct so first one is retirement

[10:23:40 - 10:23:45]
goals so we need to set a clear

[10:23:43 - 10:23:48]
retirement goal if for example if I'm

[10:23:45 - 10:23:50]
going to retire after 15 years means I

[10:23:48 - 10:23:53]
need to be have this much of cash in

[10:23:50 - 10:23:56]
hand and this much of balance we need to

[10:23:53 - 10:23:59]
save in the bank or this much of amount

[10:23:56 - 10:24:03]
I need to invest on this particular

[10:23:59 - 10:24:06]
Securities or it may be on real

[10:24:03 - 10:24:08]
assets that is on land and building okay

[10:24:06 - 10:24:10]
whatever the other things are there how

[10:24:08 - 10:24:13]
much I need to invest on that so that

[10:24:10 - 10:24:16]
after retirement I have the money in

[10:24:13 - 10:24:19]
hand or cash in hand for our day-to-day

[10:24:16 - 10:24:23]
expenses or meet the day day to-day

[10:24:19 - 10:24:25]
operations activities of our

[10:24:23 - 10:24:28]
life

[10:24:25 - 10:24:29]
so it's important to have a clear idea

[10:24:28 - 10:24:33]
of what you

[10:24:29 - 10:24:35]
want your retirement to look like so

[10:24:33 - 10:24:37]
this may include things like where you

[10:24:35 - 10:24:40]
want to live what kind of activities you

[10:24:37 - 10:24:43]
want to do and how much money you will

[10:24:40 - 10:24:45]
need to support your lifestyle so I've

[10:24:43 - 10:24:47]
already told you the day-to-day

[10:24:45 - 10:24:50]
activities or meet the day-to-day

[10:24:47 - 10:24:53]
expenses okay we need to plan if for

[10:24:50 - 10:24:57]
example for one month how much money is

[10:24:53 - 10:25:00]
required okay to get that one whatever

[10:24:57 - 10:25:02]
the forecasted value is there okay that

[10:25:00 - 10:25:05]
we need to plan and from this to

[10:25:02 - 10:25:08]
retirement we need to save that money so

[10:25:05 - 10:25:11]
every month I need to get 5,000 rupees

[10:25:08 - 10:25:12]
just for a household expenses for

[10:25:11 - 10:25:15]
medical expenses this much for

[10:25:12 - 10:25:17]
transportation this much okay total this

[10:25:15 - 10:25:19]
is the amount required after retirement

[10:25:17 - 10:25:21]
for every month so for that money I need

[10:25:19 - 10:25:22]
to get the after retirement means I need

[10:25:21 - 10:25:26]
to plan from

[10:25:22 - 10:25:27]
today okay then only you can easily lead

[10:25:26 - 10:25:31]
your life after

[10:25:27 - 10:25:34]

[10:25:31 - 10:25:37]
age so we need to knowing when you plan

[10:25:34 - 10:25:41]
to retire is important because after 10

[10:25:37 - 10:25:43]
years 15 years 20 years you need to know

[10:25:41 - 10:25:45]
at what age you are going to retire or

[10:25:43 - 10:25:48]
after how many years you are going to

[10:25:45 - 10:25:52]
retire so that you can plan well enough

[10:25:48 - 10:25:54]
Advance next retirement income I already

[10:25:52 - 10:25:56]
told you right so which are all the

[10:25:54 - 10:25:58]
available Avenues are there or pension

[10:25:56 - 10:26:01]
schemes are there or retirement schemes

[10:25:58 - 10:26:04]
were there or whatever the Securities

[10:26:01 - 10:26:06]
assets everything we need to have the

[10:26:04 - 10:26:08]
different portfolios are available we

[10:26:06 - 10:26:11]
need to invest and every month I need to

[10:26:08 - 10:26:14]
get 12,000 rupees per month as an income

[10:26:11 - 10:26:18]
for leading my life so that is the

[10:26:14 - 10:26:21]
retirement income and we need to think

[10:26:18 - 10:26:23]
about our expenses also I've already

[10:26:21 - 10:26:26]
told you about household expenses and

[10:26:23 - 10:26:29]
medical expenses okay so whatever the

[10:26:26 - 10:26:31]
like diseases or whatever the problems

[10:26:29 - 10:26:34]
are there for that we require medical

[10:26:31 - 10:26:36]
assistance correct so doctor assistance

[10:26:34 - 10:26:38]
is required medical precaution Aries are

[10:26:36 - 10:26:40]
required so that we need to clearly we

[10:26:38 - 10:26:42]
need to create some reserves for that

[10:26:40 - 10:26:45]
also so that we need to think what are

[10:26:42 - 10:26:48]
the other expenses it may arise on that

[10:26:45 - 10:26:52]
particular age okay that also we need to

[10:26:48 - 10:26:54]

[10:31:03 - 10:31:08]
earn a 10,000 rupees of

[10:31:05 - 10:31:10]

[10:31:08 - 10:31:13]
salary how can I plan better for my

[10:31:10 - 10:31:15]
retirement so planning for retirement

[10:31:13 - 10:31:19]
can be a challenging when you have the

[10:31:15 - 10:31:21]
limited income or financial resources so

[10:31:19 - 10:31:24]
if you are earning more money then that

[10:31:21 - 10:31:26]
is not a big challenge for you to keep

[10:31:24 - 10:31:28]
some money for your retirement plan also

[10:31:26 - 10:31:30]
but if you are getting very less money

[10:31:28 - 10:31:33]
on that time it is very difficult for

[10:31:30 - 10:31:34]
planning for our retirement the first we

[10:31:33 - 10:31:37]
need to do start saving

[10:31:34 - 10:31:39]
early so when you start earning the

[10:31:37 - 10:31:43]
income from that on time only you can

[10:31:39 - 10:31:45]
start saving some money for your future

[10:31:43 - 10:31:47]
or for your retirement take the

[10:31:45 - 10:31:50]

[10:31:47 - 10:31:52]
PL if any retirement plans are offered

[10:31:50 - 10:31:56]

[10:32:07 - 10:32:12]
avoid taking on debt that you can't

[10:32:10 - 10:32:16]
afford to pay back for example I cannot

[10:32:12 - 10:32:18]
repay the debt of 10 lakh Rupees so I

[10:32:16 - 10:32:20]
don't have the capability of repaying

[10:32:18 - 10:32:23]
that money or that loan so on that

[10:32:20 - 10:32:26]
scenario please don't go for that large

[10:32:23 - 10:32:29]
amount of loans or large amount of debt

[10:32:26 - 10:32:31]
whatever is visible from your hand to

[10:32:29 - 10:32:36]

sector what are the different types of

[10:35:08 - 10:35:15]
banking services available to customer

[10:35:11 - 10:35:18]

[10:35:34 - 10:35:39]
suggestions or few answers for our

[10:35:37 - 10:35:44]
questions so first one

[10:35:39 - 10:35:45]
is savings account as a banker first and

objective of the savings bank accounts

[10:35:54 - 10:36:01]
are create a savings habits with the

[10:35:58 - 10:36:03]

[10:36:01 - 10:36:04]
have the excess of money in our hand so

[10:36:03 - 10:36:06]
what we are going to do we are going to

[10:36:04 - 10:36:10]
deposit in our bank

[10:36:06 - 10:36:12]

[10:36:10 - 10:36:14]
savings bank account will create for all

[10:36:12 - 10:36:16]
an individuals correct so that is the

[10:36:14 - 10:36:19]
first service all the banking sectors or

[10:36:16 - 10:36:22]
bankers they are going to offer second

[10:36:19 - 10:36:24]
one checking accounts a checking account

[10:36:22 - 10:36:26]
is a type of bank account that is

[10:36:24 - 10:36:30]
designed for everyday transactions such

[10:36:26 - 10:36:33]
as paying bills and making purchases so

[10:36:30 - 10:36:35]
what are the different types of accounts

[10:36:33 - 10:36:37]
that Bankers are going to offer for

[10:36:35 - 10:36:40]
example as an individual I can open a

[10:36:37 - 10:36:43]
savings bank account or I can open a

[10:36:40 - 10:36:45]
recurring deposits account or at the end

[10:36:43 - 10:36:48]
I can open fixed deposits account

[10:36:45 - 10:36:50]
correct if I'm the owner of a company or

[10:36:48 - 10:36:52]
I'm going to run one company so on that

[10:36:50 - 10:36:55]
time Banker is going to offer a current

[10:36:52 - 10:36:57]
account so for current account also they

[10:36:55 - 10:36:59]
are going to give few Services

[10:36:57 - 10:37:01]
additional Services they are going to

[10:36:59 - 10:37:03]
offer that is n number of time

[10:37:01 - 10:37:05]
withdrawals or n number of time deposits

[10:37:03 - 10:37:08]
all those things will be there and

[10:37:05 - 10:37:10]
overdue facility that is the added

[10:37:08 - 10:37:12]
Advantage for this current account like

[10:37:10 - 10:37:15]
that they're going to check the

[10:37:12 - 10:37:16]
accounts as for your whatever the

[10:37:15 - 10:37:18]
transaction turnovers are there

[10:37:16 - 10:37:21]
according to the they are going to check

[10:37:18 - 10:37:23]
the what is the type of account they can

[10:37:21 - 10:37:27]
offer and next debit

[10:37:23 - 10:37:29]
cards nowadays digital India or digital

[10:37:27 - 10:37:33]
transaction we are going to do correct

[10:37:29 - 10:37:35]
so for debit cards also it will be

[10:37:33 - 10:37:38]
useful instead of carrying the cash so

[10:37:35 - 10:37:41]
we can carry debit cards like in fuel

[10:37:38 - 10:37:43]
center or for any shopping malls and

[10:37:41 - 10:37:46]
other things we can carry the simple

[10:37:43 - 10:37:49]
debit cards then we can easily we can

[10:37:46 - 10:37:51]
complete our shoppings next credit cards

[10:37:49 - 10:37:54]
so credit cards usually we are going to

[10:37:51 - 10:37:57]
use correct so whatever the bank account

[10:37:54 - 10:37:59]
are there they are going to offer so for

[10:37:57 - 10:38:01]
example if you have the bank account in

[10:37:59 - 10:38:03]
SBI you can get a credit card from SBI

[10:38:01 - 10:38:05]
in some scenarios if you don't have the

[10:38:03 - 10:38:08]
account also for example I don't have

[10:38:05 - 10:38:11]
account in SBI but also SBI will offer

[10:38:08 - 10:38:14]
the credit card and with that credit

[10:38:11 - 10:38:17]
card I can go and without any balance in

[10:38:14 - 10:38:19]
my account but also I can purchase

[10:38:17 - 10:38:21]
whatever ever the goods or services or

[10:38:19 - 10:38:23]

banking sector let us discuss on

[10:45:54 - 10:46:01]
investment strategies and portfolio

wealth management okay so how chart GPT

[10:46:01 - 10:46:06]
is going to helpful for getting the

[10:46:03 - 10:46:09]
information on this investment

[10:46:06 - 10:46:12]
strategies so first question for the

[10:46:09 - 10:46:15]
investment strategies are what are the

[10:46:12 - 10:46:17]
some effective investment strategies for

[10:46:15 - 10:46:19]
long-term wealth building

[10:46:17 - 10:46:22]
so if you want to invest so what we are

[10:46:19 - 10:46:24]
going to think first we are going to

[10:46:22 - 10:46:26]
think safety of our funds whether

[10:46:24 - 10:46:28]
whatever our investments are there

[10:46:26 - 10:46:31]
whether safety is there or not next one

[10:46:28 - 10:46:33]
the liquidity how easily we can convert

[10:46:31 - 10:46:35]
into Cash whatever the instruments we

[10:46:33 - 10:46:37]
have that we need to convert into cash

[10:46:35 - 10:46:39]
that is the second one and third one we

[10:46:37 - 10:46:41]
are going to looking at the return on

[10:46:39 - 10:46:43]
the investment correct so these are the

[10:46:41 - 10:46:46]
three things we are going to check so if

[10:46:43 - 10:46:47]
we invest for the long term how much

[10:46:46 - 10:46:51]
wealth we can

[10:46:47 - 10:46:53]
build on that particular instruments so

[10:46:51 - 10:46:55]
let's see what are the suggestions or

[10:46:53 - 10:46:58]
strategies the chart GP is going to

[10:46:55 - 10:47:01]
provide for this question so here the

[10:46:58 - 10:47:05]
few suggestions given by the chart GPT

[10:47:01 - 10:47:07]
for increase the long-term wealth or

[10:47:05 - 10:47:10]
wealth building in the investment

[10:47:07 - 10:47:12]
strategies so first one

[10:47:10 - 10:47:15]
diversification so diversification is

[10:47:12 - 10:47:18]
nothing but for example if I have 10,000

[10:47:15 - 10:47:21]
rupees for investment ments or savings I

[10:47:18 - 10:47:23]
have for Investments correct so on that

[10:47:21 - 10:47:26]
time what I need to do I'm going to

[10:47:23 - 10:47:28]
invest all 10,000 rupees in the equity

[10:47:26 - 10:47:30]
that is the diversification no or if I'm

[10:47:28 - 10:47:33]
going to invest all 10,000 in the

[10:47:30 - 10:47:35]
debentures or it may be prefer share

[10:47:33 - 10:47:38]
that is not the diversification correct

[10:47:35 - 10:47:41]
so diversification is nothing but we

[10:47:38 - 10:47:44]
need to divide or we need to invest our

[10:47:41 - 10:47:46]
money in the different avenues for

[10:47:44 - 10:47:49]
example in stock only or in the

[10:47:46 - 10:47:51]
Securities only for example 4,000 I'm

[10:47:49 - 10:47:53]
going to invest in equity share 4,000

[10:47:51 - 10:47:55]
rupees investing in the preference share

[10:47:53 - 10:47:58]
and remaining 2,000 I'm going to invest

[10:47:55 - 10:48:00]
in debenture so this is called

[10:47:58 - 10:48:04]
diversification why we have to do this

[10:48:00 - 10:48:06]
diversification means to reduce the risk

[10:48:04 - 10:48:09]
or minimize the risk involved in that

[10:48:06 - 10:48:12]
Securities correct so that is the first

[10:48:09 - 10:48:13]
suggestion given by the CH GPT so

[10:48:12 - 10:48:16]
spreading your investment across

[10:48:13 - 10:48:18]
different assets classes like stocks

[10:48:16 - 10:48:22]
bonds real estate and commodities can

[10:48:18 - 10:48:25]
reduce your risk exposure and ensure the

[10:48:22 - 10:48:27]
balanced portfolio so we need to balance

[10:48:25 - 10:48:30]
the risk and the return so if you want a

[10:48:27 - 10:48:31]
high return Then risk is also high so if

[10:48:30 - 10:48:33]
you want a moderate return then your

[10:48:31 - 10:48:36]
risk will be moderate like that we need

[10:48:33 - 10:48:39]
to balance our risk and return so on

[10:48:36 - 10:48:40]
that scenario we can get the more wealth

[10:48:39 - 10:48:45]
for the long

[10:48:40 - 10:48:47]
term next suggestion is Buy and Hold so

[10:48:45 - 10:48:49]
for example I already give the example

[10:48:47 - 10:48:51]
for 10,000 rupees I'm going to invest

[10:48:49 - 10:48:55]
4,000 in equity 4,000 in preference

[10:48:51 - 10:48:58]
share and 2,000 in debenture so if I

[10:48:55 - 10:49:00]
purchase today after 1 year what I'm

[10:48:58 - 10:49:02]
going to do if I'm going to sell that

[10:49:00 - 10:49:04]
whatever the 10,000 shares or 10,000

[10:49:02 - 10:49:07]
rupees of Securities what I have I'm

[10:49:04 - 10:49:10]
going to sell it for 15,000 rupees so my

[10:49:07 - 10:49:12]
profit is 5,000 rupees so if you are

[10:49:10 - 10:49:15]
going to sell within one year or two

[10:49:12 - 10:49:18]
years or very shortterm periods then you

[10:49:15 - 10:49:21]
cannot maximize or you cannot build the

[10:49:18 - 10:49:22]
wealth so you need to hold for at least

[10:49:21 - 10:49:25]
for 10 to 15

[10:49:22 - 10:49:27]
years okay so if you hold that

[10:49:25 - 10:49:30]
Securities for a long term then only you

[10:49:27 - 10:49:32]
can get a good wealth after the whatever

[10:49:30 - 10:49:34]
the holding periods are there after that

[10:49:32 - 10:49:36]
you are going to get very good amount or

[10:49:34 - 10:49:39]
very good return and growth of your

[10:49:36 - 10:49:41]
securities value also so you need to

[10:49:39 - 10:49:44]
hold for the long durations so this

[10:49:41 - 10:49:48]
strategy involves buying stock or funds

[10:49:44 - 10:49:49]
and holding on to them for the longterm

[10:49:48 - 10:49:51]
so longterm means at least you need to

[10:49:49 - 10:49:54]
hold for 10

[10:49:51 - 10:49:56]
years then you are going to expect very

[10:49:54 - 10:50:00]
good return and growth of your

[10:49:56 - 10:50:02]
Investments so next dollar cost

[10:50:00 - 10:50:05]
averaging so investing a fixed amount of

[10:50:02 - 10:50:08]
money at a regular intervals regardless

[10:50:05 - 10:50:11]
of Market condition can help to smooth

[10:50:08 - 10:50:14]
out the impact of Market volatility for

[10:50:11 - 10:50:17]
example so every month I'm going to save

[10:50:14 - 10:50:19]
55,000 rupees per year it is 60,000

[10:50:17 - 10:50:22]
Rupees correct so what I'm going to do

[10:50:19 - 10:50:23]
every year 60,000 I'm going to invest in

[10:50:22 - 10:50:26]
the stock

[10:50:23 - 10:50:27]
market whether what may be the market

[10:50:26 - 10:50:30]
conditions are there but I'm going to

[10:50:27 - 10:50:32]
invest 60 60,000 every year so at the

[10:50:30 - 10:50:35]
end I'm going to get a very good return

[10:50:32 - 10:50:37]
return so the market fluctuation is also

[10:50:35 - 10:50:38]
there whatever the volatility or

[10:50:37 - 10:50:40]
fluctuations are there in the market but

[10:50:38 - 10:50:43]
also I'm going to invest I'm going to

[10:50:40 - 10:50:46]
get a good return at the end that is the

can I diversify my Investment Portfolio

[10:53:50 - 10:53:54]
to minimize the risk that is the last

[10:53:52 - 10:53:56]
question we have discussed how we need

[10:53:54 - 10:53:57]
to invest in different Avenues or what

[10:53:56 - 10:54:00]
are the Avenues are available for

[10:53:57 - 10:54:02]
investing our money correct so next

[10:54:00 - 10:54:04]
question I I'm going to ask for how we

[10:54:02 - 10:54:07]
are going to diversify our investment so

[10:54:04 - 10:54:10]
we can reduce our risk and we can manage

[10:54:07 - 10:54:12]
the risk in our portfolio so here are

[10:54:10 - 10:54:15]
few suggestions given by the chat JP

[10:54:12 - 10:54:18]
that is assets classes so what are the

[10:54:15 - 10:54:20]
different asset classes are there okay

[10:54:18 - 10:54:23]
first we need to check like in different

[10:54:20 - 10:54:26]
asset classes such as stocks bonds real

[10:54:23 - 10:54:27]
estate or Commodities and cash okay so

[10:54:26 - 10:54:29]
these are the different Avenues are

[10:54:27 - 10:54:33]
available so first we need to check

[10:54:29 - 10:54:35]
which are the feasible avenues for us

[10:54:33 - 10:54:37]
okay we can invest in that or we can

[10:54:35 - 10:54:40]
trade in that that we need to check

[10:54:37 - 10:54:42]
second thing we can go for like

[10:54:40 - 10:54:45]
geographical boundaries so invest in

[10:54:42 - 10:54:47]
different region and countries to take

[10:54:45 - 10:54:50]
advantage of op opportunities and

[10:54:47 - 10:54:52]
mitigate risk associated with the Local

[10:54:50 - 10:54:54]
Economic and political conditions so as

[10:54:52 - 10:54:56]
per the or according to whatever the

[10:54:54 - 10:54:58]
economic conditions are there political

[10:54:56 - 10:55:00]
conditions are there so depending on

[10:54:58 - 10:55:05]
that also we need to plan our

[10:55:00 - 10:55:06]
investment next sector wise which is the

[10:55:05 - 10:55:08]
for example banking sector or

[10:55:06 - 10:55:11]
manufacturing sector or it sector

[10:55:08 - 10:55:14]
whatever the sectors are there whichever

[10:55:11 - 10:55:18]
is there in the peak or whichever is

[10:55:14 - 10:55:20]
going good or it is making good profit

[10:55:18 - 10:55:22]
in the economy that we need to check

[10:55:20 - 10:55:25]
sectorial wise and then we need to start

[10:55:22 - 10:55:27]
investing our money sector wise

[10:55:25 - 10:55:29]
investment

[10:55:27 - 10:55:32]
vehicles so use different investment

[10:55:29 - 10:55:36]
vehicles such as mutual funds Exchange

[10:55:32 - 10:55:39]
Trade funds individual stocks bonds Etc

[10:55:36 - 10:55:41]
so we need to think which are all the

[10:55:39 - 10:55:43]
riders or vehicles are there in the

[10:55:41 - 10:55:46]
market according to that we need to

[10:55:43 - 10:55:48]
start investing our money so risk levels

[10:55:46 - 10:55:51]
so what is the risk level are involved

[10:55:48 - 10:55:53]
in that particular sector or particular

[10:55:51 - 10:55:55]
Securities that we need to check and

[10:55:53 - 10:55:57]
then we need to invest if for example

[10:55:55 - 10:56:01]
high risk is there for that particular

[10:55:57 - 10:56:02]
sector for example so on that time

[10:56:01 - 10:56:04]
whether we need to invest in that sector

[10:56:02 - 10:56:08]
or not that we need to

[10:56:04 - 10:56:10]
check after covid effects medical

[10:56:08 - 10:56:12]
companies or whatever the medicine

[10:56:10 - 10:56:14]
companies are there they're making very

[10:56:12 - 10:56:17]
good profit correct so on that time that

[10:56:14 - 10:56:20]
is the in boom so on that time we need

[10:56:17 - 10:56:21]
to invest on particular stock market or

[10:56:20 - 10:56:24]
whatever the sector are there on that we

[10:56:21 - 10:56:26]
need to invest whichever is having the

[10:56:24 - 10:56:28]
high risk on that time we need to think

[10:56:26 - 10:56:31]
and then we need to invest our money in

[10:56:28 - 10:56:32]
that particular Securities time Horizons

[10:56:31 - 10:56:34]
so what are the time period you are

[10:56:32 - 10:56:36]
going to invest whether it may be a

[10:56:34 - 10:56:38]
shortterm medium-term longterm that you

[10:56:36 - 10:56:42]
need to check and then you need to

[10:56:38 - 10:56:44]
invest your money so it is the important

[10:56:42 - 10:56:47]
things for any individual to minimize

[10:56:44 - 10:56:49]
their risk and divers if y their assets

[10:56:47 - 10:56:52]
or diversify their portfolio management

[10:56:49 - 10:56:55]
and to invest their money so these are

[10:56:52 - 10:56:57]
the few suggestions so next question how

[10:56:55 - 10:57:00]
should I balance risk and return When

[10:56:57 - 10:57:01]
investing in different types of assets I

[10:57:00 - 10:57:04]
have already told you we need to

[10:57:01 - 10:57:06]
diversify our funds we need to invest in

[10:57:04 - 10:57:07]
different Avenues or different assets

[10:57:06 - 10:57:09]
classes are there in that we need to

[10:57:07 - 10:57:12]
invest correct so in that also risk is

[10:57:09 - 10:57:14]
involved correct so how should I balance

[10:57:12 - 10:57:16]
that risk if I'm going to invest in

[10:57:14 - 10:57:19]
different assets or different types of

[10:57:16 - 10:57:22]

[10:57:22 - 10:57:27]
is a key consideration when investing in

[10:57:25 - 10:57:29]
the different types of assets so

[10:57:27 - 10:57:31]
wherever it may be not only for assets

[10:57:29 - 10:57:33]
or not only for security or any other

[10:57:31 - 10:57:36]
things okay we need to check what is the

[10:57:33 - 10:57:38]
risk and return return after that only

[10:57:36 - 10:57:41]
we need to invest our money so first one

[10:57:38 - 10:57:45]
understand your risk tolerance so how

[10:57:41 - 10:57:46]
much you are capable to maintain or how

much capable you you are to take the

[10:57:46 - 10:57:52]

check okay so second one determine your

[10:57:52 - 10:57:56]

[10:57:54 - 10:57:58]
goals so in the personal finance only we

[10:57:56 - 10:58:00]

[10:57:58 - 10:58:03]
financial goal whether it may be a

your assets so which are the assets are

[10:58:09 - 10:58:14]

numbers are there so they are going to

[11:00:36 - 11:00:41]
give one number okay so according to

[11:00:39 - 11:00:43]
that how much you are capable or all

[11:00:41 - 11:00:45]
your financial institution or Banks

[11:00:43 - 11:00:47]
everyone they are going to check this

[11:00:45 - 11:00:48]
credit score for and then only they are

[11:00:47 - 11:00:51]
going to give the loans or they are

[11:00:48 - 11:00:53]
going to provide the loans so credit

[11:00:51 - 11:00:55]
worthiness that is the credit repayment

[11:00:53 - 11:00:58]
capacity of an individual so it is

[11:00:55 - 11:01:01]
calculated based on your the information

[11:00:58 - 11:01:03]
contained in their credit

[11:01:01 - 11:01:07]
report which includes their credit

[11:01:03 - 11:01:09]
history so past whatever the Emi or

[11:01:07 - 11:01:13]
credit repayments I'm going to do or

[11:01:09 - 11:01:15]
that XYZ person is going to do or he is

[11:01:13 - 11:01:18]
done correct so that they are going to

[11:01:15 - 11:01:20]
take all the past transaction or past

[11:01:18 - 11:01:22]
history of that particular person and

[11:01:20 - 11:01:26]
then they are going to calculate this

[11:01:22 - 11:01:29]
credit score so payments history are the

[11:01:26 - 11:01:33]
outstanding debts so the most commonly

[11:01:29 - 11:01:36]
used credit score in the United States

[11:01:33 - 11:01:40]
is the FICO score which ranges from 300

[11:01:36 - 11:01:42]
to 850 the higher the score the better

[11:01:40 - 11:01:44]
the individual credit worthiness

[11:01:42 - 11:01:49]
perceived to be so if your credit rating

[11:01:44 - 11:01:52]
score is more than like 700 750 800 then

[11:01:49 - 11:01:55]
you are very good that is your credit

[11:01:52 - 11:01:58]
repayment capacity is very good so that

[11:01:55 - 11:01:59]
is how they are going to calculate and

[11:01:58 - 11:02:01]
these are the

[11:01:59 - 11:02:03]
criterias okay so there are several

[11:02:01 - 11:02:05]
factors that are taken into

[11:02:03 - 11:02:08]
consideration when calculating the

[11:02:05 - 11:02:10]
credit score so in brief we are told you

[11:02:08 - 11:02:12]
like so what is the credit history of

[11:02:10 - 11:02:15]
that particular person payment history

[11:02:12 - 11:02:16]
or the outstanding debts based on that

[11:02:15 - 11:02:18]
they are going to calculate Cal so here

[11:02:16 - 11:02:20]
this chart jpd is given clear

[11:02:18 - 11:02:23]
information what are the things they are

[11:02:20 - 11:02:25]
going to take into consideration while

[11:02:23 - 11:02:29]
calculating the credit score of a

[11:02:25 - 11:02:31]
particular person so payment history

[11:02:29 - 11:02:33]
whether it may be your credit card bills

[11:02:31 - 11:02:35]
okay every month or on time you are

[11:02:33 - 11:02:37]
going to pay the credit card bill or

[11:02:35 - 11:02:38]
whatever the emis are there or whatever

[11:02:37 - 11:02:41]
the debts you are taken for that you

[11:02:38 - 11:02:43]
need to repay the Emi correct so monthly

[11:02:41 - 11:02:45]
wise you need to pay that is regularly

[11:02:43 - 11:02:49]
you are going to pay or not in sometime

[11:02:45 - 11:02:53]
if you are delayed or any transaction

[11:02:49 - 11:02:56]
was denied from your end everything they

[11:02:53 - 11:02:59]
are going to check so amount owed that

[11:02:56 - 11:03:02]
is how much amount you are going to take

[11:02:59 - 11:03:04]
that is the this account for 30% of the

[11:03:02 - 11:03:07]
score and looks at the total amount owed

[11:03:04 - 11:03:09]
across all the credit accounts for

[11:03:07 - 11:03:13]
example my income is 50,000 I've already

[11:03:09 - 11:03:15]
taken enough loan okay after that also

[11:03:13 - 11:03:18]
if I'm going to planning to take or if

[11:03:15 - 11:03:20]
I'm plan to take then the banker they

[11:03:18 - 11:03:23]
are going to check what is the total OES

[11:03:20 - 11:03:25]
you have okay based on that also they

[11:03:23 - 11:03:26]
are going to calculate and they are

[11:03:25 - 11:03:29]
going to disperse or they are going to

[11:03:26 - 11:03:32]
approve some amount of loan length of

[11:03:29 - 11:03:34]
credit history so this account for 15

[11:03:32 - 11:03:38]
years of the score and looks at how long

[11:03:34 - 11:03:40]
an individual has at credit accounts and

[11:03:38 - 11:03:43]
average age of their accounts so for

[11:03:40 - 11:03:45]
example if I'm going to purchase a house

[11:03:43 - 11:03:47]
so I need to go for a home loan or

[11:03:45 - 11:03:49]
housing loan loan so how many years you

[11:03:47 - 11:03:51]
are going to take that loan and what is

[11:03:49 - 11:03:52]
your age based on that also they are

[11:03:51 - 11:03:56]
going to

[11:03:52 - 11:03:59]
calculate and credit mix this account

[11:03:56 - 11:04:01]
for 10% of the score and looks at the

[11:03:59 - 11:04:04]
different types of credit accounts and

[11:04:01 - 11:04:06]
individual as such as credit cards loans

[11:04:04 - 11:04:09]
and marage so I already told you not

[11:04:06 - 11:04:11]
only your loans or not only your credit

[11:04:09 - 11:04:14]
cards they are going to take all these

[11:04:11 - 11:04:15]
things credit card payment or loan

[11:04:14 - 11:04:17]
payments or whatever the secured loans

[11:04:15 - 11:04:19]
that is M gaau loan you have taken

[11:04:17 - 11:04:22]
everything they are going to check for

[11:04:19 - 11:04:25]
the credit score new credit this account

[11:04:22 - 11:04:27]
for 10% of the score and looks at how

[11:04:25 - 11:04:30]
often an individual applies for new

[11:04:27 - 11:04:32]
credit and the number of recently opened

[11:04:30 - 11:04:35]
accounts so how many times you are going

[11:04:32 - 11:04:38]
to take the loans for example I'm going

[11:04:35 - 11:04:40]
to take a loan personal loan every year

[11:04:38 - 11:04:43]
because of some commitments and I'm

[11:04:40 - 11:04:45]
going to repay so that things also makes

[11:04:43 - 11:04:47]
year or they are going to take into

[11:04:45 - 11:04:50]
consideration while calculating the

[11:04:47 - 11:04:52]
credit score so these are all the

[11:04:50 - 11:04:56]
meaning of sorry this is the meaning of

[11:04:52 - 11:04:58]
credit score and these are all the few

[11:04:56 - 11:05:01]
consideration they are going to do while

[11:04:58 - 11:05:03]
calculating the credit score so these

[11:05:01 - 11:05:06]
are the advises or suggestions given by

[11:05:03 - 11:05:10]
the CH GPD for the personal credit

[11:05:06 - 11:05:14]
scores next question if for example my

[11:05:10 - 11:05:16]
credit score is 600 I need to improve my

[11:05:14 - 11:05:20]
credit score now because I need to

[11:05:16 - 11:05:22]
purchase a home or apartment so I need

[11:05:20 - 11:05:24]
to go for a loan correct so on that time

[11:05:22 - 11:05:26]
I need to improve my credit score

[11:05:24 - 11:05:29]
otherwise no Banker or no financial

[11:05:26 - 11:05:32]
institution are ready to pay or ready to

[11:05:29 - 11:05:34]
give the loan to me so on that time we

[11:05:32 - 11:05:36]
need to know what are the strategies are

[11:05:34 - 11:05:39]
there to improve my credit score so on

[11:05:36 - 11:05:41]
that time that query you can ask the CH

[11:05:39 - 11:05:45]
GPT so it will give few suggestions or

[11:05:41 - 11:05:48]
advises to improve our credit score so

[11:05:45 - 11:05:51]
the the first suggestion first advice is

[11:05:48 - 11:05:53]
pay your bills on time so for example if

[11:05:51 - 11:05:56]
the credit card bill is due on every

[11:05:53 - 11:05:57]
month 10th so you need to pay on or

[11:05:56 - 11:06:00]
before

[11:05:57 - 11:06:03]
10th instead of paying on 10th you can

[11:06:00 - 11:06:04]
pay it on 8th 9th okay whenever it is

[11:06:03 - 11:06:06]
possible or whenever you have the

[11:06:04 - 11:06:07]
sufficient funds with you please pay

[11:06:06 - 11:06:10]
that

[11:06:07 - 11:06:13]
money that is the first advice second

[11:06:10 - 11:06:16]
one reduce your credit card

[11:06:13 - 11:06:19]
balances so Banker yes there going to

[11:06:16 - 11:06:21]
offer okay based on our past history or

[11:06:19 - 11:06:24]
past payments they are going to offer to

[11:06:21 - 11:06:26]
increase our money for example first

[11:06:24 - 11:06:28]
year they are going to give for 15,000

[11:06:26 - 11:06:31]
as a limit next as per your whatever the

[11:06:28 - 11:06:33]
past payment history they are ready to

[11:06:31 - 11:06:37]
increase your credit card limit for

[11:06:33 - 11:06:40]
30,000 or 45,000 so instead of Simply

[11:06:37 - 11:06:42]
increasing based on your requirement you

[11:06:40 - 11:06:46]
can go for that otherwise please reduce

[11:06:42 - 11:06:49]
the credit card balance next

[11:06:46 - 11:06:52]
pay down the debt so whatever the debts

[11:06:49 - 11:06:56]
are there or loans are there try to

[11:06:52 - 11:06:59]
reduce the debts or try to repay the

[11:06:56 - 11:07:01]
debt high levels of debt okay so

[11:06:59 - 11:07:03]
especially on credit cards can

[11:07:01 - 11:07:06]
negatively impact your credit score so

[11:07:03 - 11:07:10]
so as much as possible reduce the credit

[11:07:06 - 11:07:13]
card bills on that time next check your

[11:07:10 - 11:07:15]
credit report for errors so in that

[11:07:13 - 11:07:17]
credit report only they are going to

[11:07:15 - 11:07:19]
gives the what are the errors you have

[11:07:17 - 11:07:22]
done so that is the reason they have

[11:07:19 - 11:07:24]
deducted this many points or they have

[11:07:22 - 11:07:27]
given the whatever the credit score for

[11:07:24 - 11:07:30]
you okay check that whatever you have

[11:07:27 - 11:07:33]
done in the past next keep old accounts

[11:07:30 - 11:07:35]
open the length of your credit history

[11:07:33 - 11:07:38]
is a factor in determining your credit

[11:07:35 - 11:07:41]
score keep your oldest credit accounts

[11:07:38 - 11:07:43]
open to demonstrate a long credit

[11:07:41 - 11:07:46]
history so whatever the old accounts are

[11:07:43 - 11:07:48]
there that needs to be like open because

[11:07:46 - 11:07:50]
you are going to regularly repaying that

[11:07:48 - 11:07:53]
money correct so that should be one

[11:07:50 - 11:07:55]
strategy don't open too many new

[11:07:53 - 11:07:58]
accounts at

[11:07:55 - 11:08:00]
once okay don't go for whatever the new

[11:07:58 - 11:08:02]
loans are available or whatever the

[11:08:00 - 11:08:07]
requirements are there okay on that time

[11:08:02 - 11:08:10]
don't open many accounts or many loans

[11:08:07 - 11:08:13]
accounts next consider a secured credit

[11:08:10 - 11:08:16]
card okay so these are the few

[11:08:13 - 11:08:18]
suggestions for improving your credit

[11:08:16 - 11:08:20]
score given by the chat GPT so if you

[11:08:18 - 11:08:24]
follow these strategies then you can

[11:08:20 - 11:08:27]
easily go or you can get the good credit

[11:08:24 - 11:08:30]
score we have one quote prevention is

[11:08:27 - 11:08:32]
better than cure we have looked at the

[11:08:30 - 11:08:35]
what are the strategies available for

[11:08:32 - 11:08:37]
improving our credit score before that

[11:08:35 - 11:08:39]
what are the common mistakes or how we

[11:08:37 - 11:08:42]
are going to do the mistakes while

[11:08:39 - 11:08:45]
negatively impacting our credit score

[11:08:42 - 11:08:47]
that we can avoid correct so we'll see

[11:08:45 - 11:08:50]
what are the common mistakes everyone

[11:08:47 - 11:08:52]
are going to do for their credit score

[11:08:50 - 11:08:55]
negatively impacting on the credit score

[11:08:52 - 11:08:58]
so first one late or missed

[11:08:55 - 11:09:02]
payment so I have given the example of

[11:08:58 - 11:09:05]
10th is your credit card bill is due

[11:09:02 - 11:09:07]
correct we need to pay within that don't

[11:09:05 - 11:09:11]
miss that repaying that whatever the

[11:09:07 - 11:09:13]
outstanding is there you need to pay on

[11:09:11 - 11:09:17]
or before the due

[11:09:13 - 11:09:20]
dates next maximizing out credit cards

[11:09:17 - 11:09:23]
so increasing the limits closing old

[11:09:20 - 11:09:26]
credit accounts applying for too much of

[11:09:23 - 11:09:30]
credit at once I already told you about

[11:09:26 - 11:09:32]
this correct so defaulting on loans

[11:09:30 - 11:09:35]
ignoring your credit report co-signing

[11:09:32 - 11:09:39]
for someone else so we are going to give

[11:09:35 - 11:09:41]
the security correct that is also

[11:09:39 - 11:09:43]
negatively impact of your credit score

[11:09:41 - 11:09:45]
because if they have not paid then it

will comes to you people only so these

[11:12:19 - 11:12:26]
during pre-training GPT learns the

[11:12:22 - 11:12:29]
basics of language that is grammar

[11:12:26 - 11:12:32]
sentence structure and even some facts

[11:12:29 - 11:12:36]
about the world it's like the AI is

[11:12:32 - 11:12:39]
soaking up all this knowledge GPT is

[11:12:36 - 11:12:41]
built using a special architecture

[11:12:39 - 11:12:44]
called a

[11:12:41 - 11:12:47]
Transformer specifically the decoder

[11:12:44 - 11:12:50]
part of the Transformer this structure

[11:12:47 - 11:12:54]
is really good at understanding the

[11:12:50 - 11:12:56]
context of the words for example it

[11:12:54 - 11:13:00]
knows the difference

[11:12:56 - 11:13:04]
between apple the fruit and apple the

[11:13:00 - 11:13:08]
company based on the surrounding words

[11:13:04 - 11:13:12]
the Transformer decoder has

[11:13:08 - 11:13:15]
layers imagine a sandwich each layer

[11:13:12 - 11:13:18]
processes information and passes it to

[11:13:15 - 11:13:21]
the next layer getting more refined with

[11:13:18 - 11:13:25]
each step this helps GPT understand and

[11:13:21 - 11:13:29]
generate humanlike text now when you

[11:13:25 - 11:13:32]
give GPD a prompt like once upon a time

[11:13:29 - 11:13:35]
it uses everything it learn to predict

[11:13:32 - 11:13:38]
and generate the next part of the story

[11:13:35 - 11:13:42]
one word at a time it's like a super

[11:13:38 - 11:13:45]
smart autocomplete you can use GPT for a

[11:13:42 - 11:13:49]
lot of cool things writing is

[11:13:45 - 11:13:51]
coding help creating content and even

[11:13:49 - 11:13:54]

the versions wherever whatever versions

[11:14:46 - 11:14:55]
you can use GPT 3.5 GPT 4 GPT

[11:14:50 - 11:14:58]
40 however we are here to see how in

[11:14:55 - 11:15:03]
chat GPT we can create our own custom

[11:14:58 - 11:15:06]
gpts first let's explore various

[11:15:03 - 11:15:09]
different gpts now there is explore gpts

research and Analysis in research and is

[11:18:15 - 11:18:22]
you have scholar GPT scholar AI then

[11:18:18 - 11:18:25]
size space Excel GPT these things you

[11:18:22 - 11:18:28]
can explore and you can see how they

[11:18:25 - 11:18:29]
have been performing because if they

[11:18:28 - 11:18:33]
have been performing either they would

[11:18:29 - 11:18:35]
be on topics or trending section then

[11:18:33 - 11:18:38]
you have education in education you have

[11:18:35 - 11:18:41]
mathematics solver tutor then you have

[11:18:38 - 11:18:43]
diagram creators Universal primer the

[11:18:41 - 11:18:47]
fastest way to learn like it can tutor

[11:18:43 - 11:18:49]
you right so everything and it gives you

[11:18:47 - 11:18:53]
from where it has come like for example

[11:18:49 - 11:18:57]
tuto me is by Khan Academy okay and

[11:18:53 - 11:19:01]
previously we saw video GPT by Ved right

[11:18:57 - 11:19:04]
so it gives you by uh whom this has been

[11:19:01 - 11:19:09]
created by whom like for example diagram

[11:19:04 - 11:19:13]
diagram uh has been by helpful. Dev

[11:19:09 - 11:19:16]
canva is by canva.com so it features

[11:19:13 - 11:19:20]
chart gbt features gpts from various

[11:19:16 - 11:19:22]
different platforms various different

[11:19:20 - 11:19:26]
organizations who wants to offer an

[11:19:22 - 11:19:28]
integration with chat GPD then you have

[11:19:26 - 11:19:32]
lifestyle you have astrology and

[11:19:28 - 11:19:34]
lifestyle travel guide gaming then you

[11:19:32 - 11:19:37]
have in programming you have code

[11:19:34 - 11:19:41]
copilot which helps you with programming

[11:19:37 - 11:19:44]
you can learn python with python GPT you

[11:19:41 - 11:19:47]
can have website generator this is a GPT

[11:19:44 - 11:19:49]
for creating website for you then there

[11:19:47 - 11:19:54]
is a code gbt which helps you with

[11:19:49 - 11:19:56]
python Java C HTML SQL JavaScript react

[11:19:54 - 11:20:01]
all these programming languages then you

[11:19:56 - 11:20:05]
have xql expert and many more so these

[11:20:01 - 11:20:10]
are the custom gpts which are already

[11:20:05 - 11:20:13]
there in your chat GPT platform and you

[11:20:10 - 11:20:15]
can use them based on whatever model GPT

[11:20:13 - 11:20:18]
model that you are using

[11:20:15 - 11:20:23]
but let's now first diving before diving

[11:20:18 - 11:20:26]
into creating your own custom GPT let's

[11:20:23 - 11:20:30]
quickly check one custom GPD from chart

[11:20:26 - 11:20:33]
GPD okay so let's do data science which

[11:20:30 - 11:20:36]
specializes in which is by Oracle and is

[11:20:33 - 11:20:40]
an expert or specializes in data

[11:20:36 - 11:20:45]
analysis and visualization so we create

[11:20:40 - 11:20:47]
a data science GPT and it gives you the

[11:20:45 - 11:20:49]
rating also from which category it has

[11:20:47 - 11:20:52]
been taken there are how many

[11:20:49 - 11:20:54]
conversations and what is the rating for

[11:20:52 - 11:20:57]
this and what are the conversation

[11:20:54 - 11:21:00]
starters conversation starters means it

[11:20:57 - 11:21:02]
will give you suggestions when you talk

[11:21:00 - 11:21:05]
or when you prompt your GPT it will give

[11:21:02 - 11:21:07]
you suggestions okay how you can start

[11:21:05 - 11:21:09]
your conversation or how you can

[11:21:07 - 11:21:11]
continue and it gives you the

[11:21:09 - 11:21:15]
capabilities it has browsing

[11:21:11 - 11:21:18]
capabilities it has Del llm which for

[11:21:15 - 11:21:22]
images and code interpreter and data

[11:21:18 - 11:21:25]
analysis tool which is an integration

[11:21:22 - 11:21:29]
with chart GPT and the

[11:21:25 - 11:21:34]
ratings right so let's

[11:21:29 - 11:21:40]
start now it has created a similar

[11:21:34 - 11:21:44]
chat okay but your GPT is data science

[11:21:40 - 11:21:48]
so let's start analyzing some data we

[11:21:44 - 11:21:51]
have picked Titanic data set from kaggle

[11:21:48 - 11:21:51]
for this

[11:21:54 - 11:22:03]
activity so I load my Titanic data set

[11:21:58 - 11:22:07]
here and write a prompt check the data

[11:22:03 - 11:22:11]
for missing values and give python code

[11:22:07 - 11:22:14]
for the same because when you first load

[11:22:11 - 11:22:16]
a data you first of all see are there

[11:22:14 - 11:22:17]
any missing values you do data

[11:22:16 - 11:22:19]
pre-processing and in data

[11:22:17 - 11:22:23]
pre-processing the first step is seeing

[11:22:19 - 11:22:26]
if your data has missing values or not

[11:22:23 - 11:22:31]
so we enter this so what does it do it

[11:22:26 - 11:22:32]
gives you okay these are your colums in

[11:22:31 - 11:22:37]
your data set

[11:22:32 - 11:22:43]
and which are passenger ID class name

[11:22:37 - 11:22:43]
the gender the age Etc

[11:22:45 - 11:22:51]
and it gives you data set contains

[11:22:48 - 11:22:54]
missing values for following columns how

[11:22:51 - 11:22:57]
many columns three columns AG cabin and

[11:22:54 - 11:23:00]
embarked how many values age has 177

[11:22:57 - 11:23:03]
missing values cabin has

[11:23:00 - 11:23:05]
687 missing values embarked has two

[11:23:03 - 11:23:09]
missing values how to do the coding for

[11:23:05 - 11:23:12]
this if you want to implement on your

[11:23:09 - 11:23:16]
local for the same you can copy paste

[11:23:12 - 11:23:18]
the same code where it UTS Panda's

[11:23:16 - 11:23:22]
Library gives the file path you can give

[11:23:18 - 11:23:25]
the file path read CSV you can read CSV

[11:23:22 - 11:23:27]
from this uh python function then in

[11:23:25 - 11:23:32]
missing values it'll

[11:23:27 - 11:23:34]
do isnull do sum function will give you

[11:23:32 - 11:23:39]
all the missing values

[11:23:34 - 11:23:42]
now this is your code for missing values

[11:23:39 - 11:23:45]
for Titanic data set before going on to

[11:23:42 - 11:23:49]
our next

[11:23:45 - 11:23:52]
it gives you already gives you a prompt

[11:23:49 - 11:23:55]
can you visualize the missing data or

[11:23:52 - 11:23:58]
you can go to how to handle these

[11:23:55 - 11:23:59]
missing values so click on it how to

[11:23:58 - 11:24:02]
handle these missing

[11:23:59 - 11:24:04]
values so it will give you you can drop

[11:24:02 - 11:24:07]
your missing values you can impute your

[11:24:04 - 11:24:10]
missing values you can use predictive

[11:24:07 - 11:24:12]
imputation right and it'll it is giving

[11:24:10 - 11:24:15]
you all the codes that okay if you want

[11:24:12 - 11:24:18]
to drop if you want to impute if you

[11:24:15 - 11:24:21]
want to do predictive imputation so all

[11:24:18 - 11:24:22]
these things are given and prompted by

[11:24:21 - 11:24:25]
your

[11:24:22 - 11:24:28]
GPT however if you see your chat gbt it

[11:24:25 - 11:24:31]
is more towards

[11:24:28 - 11:24:36]
generic but this GPT custom GPT that is

[11:24:31 - 11:24:38]
data science GPT is customized for you

[11:24:36 - 11:24:41]
for your specific data or for your

[11:24:38 - 11:24:45]
specific task that's why it asks you

[11:24:41 - 11:24:48]
specific things or you can give

[11:24:45 - 11:24:52]
specific prompts related to your data

[11:24:48 - 11:24:54]
now show the updated data set in the

[11:24:52 - 11:24:56]
table Tableau format or visualize age

[11:24:54 - 11:24:58]
distribution whatever you want to do or

[11:24:56 - 11:25:00]
you can give your own thing that

[11:24:58 - 11:25:02]
pre-process the data but we have already

[11:25:00 - 11:25:06]
pre-process the data that we have

[11:25:02 - 11:25:08]
imputed the missing values you can do

[11:25:06 - 11:25:10]
visualization let's click on

[11:25:08 - 11:25:12]
visualization it will give you a

[11:25:10 - 11:25:16]
distribution you know analyzing and

[11:25:12 - 11:25:19]
gives you an age distrib bution because

[11:25:16 - 11:25:24]
based on the data it would have seen

[11:25:19 - 11:25:27]
that age as a factor for Titanic data

[11:25:24 - 11:25:31]
set holds much more value than other

[11:25:27 - 11:25:33]
features in your data set now survival

[11:25:31 - 11:25:35]
rate now visualize we can do any

[11:25:33 - 11:25:38]
visualization but it says analyze

[11:25:35 - 11:25:41]
survival rates by Passenger class you

[11:25:38 - 11:25:43]
can go on because it'll give you based

[11:25:41 - 11:25:44]
on your data supposing I just want to

[11:25:43 - 11:25:48]
switch

[11:25:44 - 11:25:50]
to cut to the end that okay I want to

[11:25:48 - 11:25:54]
build a predictive model that answers

[11:25:50 - 11:25:57]
the question what sorts of people were

[11:25:54 - 11:25:59]
more likely to survive using passenger

[11:25:57 - 11:26:03]
data

[11:25:59 - 11:26:06]
okay I give this and it builds on the

[11:26:03 - 11:26:08]
same that okay do pre-processing do

[11:26:06 - 11:26:11]
feature selection do model training do

[11:26:08 - 11:26:14]
evaluation and then it

[11:26:11 - 11:26:15]
gives that okay Titanic data set these

[11:26:14 - 11:26:18]
are the the

[11:26:15 - 11:26:20]
steps however here it missed that you

[11:26:18 - 11:26:22]
have already built on it that okay you

[11:26:20 - 11:26:25]
have done the missing values you have

[11:26:22 - 11:26:28]
dropped you have imput imputed and you

[11:26:25 - 11:26:30]
want to continue you have visualized you

[11:26:28 - 11:26:33]
want to continue that context is lost

[11:26:30 - 11:26:35]
and you can give that feedback to your

[11:26:33 - 11:26:38]
custom GPT that okay these are the

[11:26:35 - 11:26:40]
things that got missed and these were I

[11:26:38 - 11:26:42]
wanted to continue with the conversation

[11:26:40 - 11:26:45]
that was I was having the context should

[11:26:42 - 11:26:49]
be the same however thanks yully that

[11:26:45 - 11:26:50]
the GPT picked up the same that okay

[11:26:49 - 11:26:54]
pre-process your

[11:26:50 - 11:26:56]
data in that handle missing values

[11:26:54 - 11:26:59]
convert categorical values into numeric

[11:26:56 - 11:27:01]
standardize or normalize the data then

[11:26:59 - 11:27:04]
there is feature selection model

[11:27:01 - 11:27:06]
training model evaluation and it is

[11:27:04 - 11:27:09]
giving you the python code because the

[11:27:06 - 11:27:11]
first prompt we said please give the

[11:27:09 - 11:27:13]
python code if you do not give the

[11:27:11 - 11:27:16]
prompt that you want some type of code

[11:27:13 - 11:27:20]
out of it any language it will not give

[11:27:16 - 11:27:23]
you okay so this is taking context from

[11:27:20 - 11:27:26]
the first promt that we gave now you

[11:27:23 - 11:27:28]
have all the codes and you can execute

[11:27:26 - 11:27:30]
that which is performing for you and it

[11:27:28 - 11:27:32]
has given the explanation as well that

[11:27:30 - 11:27:34]
you have missing values for these these

[11:27:32 - 11:27:37]
were the categorical variables that were

[11:27:34 - 11:27:40]
converted to numerical now selected

[11:27:37 - 11:27:43]
features were these model

[11:27:40 - 11:27:45]
training splitting uh was done and

[11:27:43 - 11:27:48]
logistic regression as a model was

[11:27:45 - 11:27:52]
applied and you have the accuracy Roc

[11:27:48 - 11:27:55]
and Au score Roc curve is plotted to

[11:27:52 - 11:27:58]
visualize the performance okay so all

[11:27:55 - 11:28:02]
these things are given as a code however

[11:27:58 - 11:28:07]
you are not seeing the result you can

[11:28:02 - 11:28:11]
ask that for example on what basis did

[11:28:07 - 11:28:13]
the feature selection happened or what

[11:28:11 - 11:28:16]
was the split ratio however you can see

[11:28:13 - 11:28:19]
the split ratio IO you can ask why this

[11:28:16 - 11:28:23]
split ratio why it was divided into

[11:28:19 - 11:28:27]
80/20 ratio why not 7030 right and you

[11:28:23 - 11:28:29]
can have these interactions and say that

[11:28:27 - 11:28:32]
okay logistic regression may not work

[11:28:29 - 11:28:35]
for this data set can we try some other

[11:28:32 - 11:28:40]
uh model it can be random Forest it can

[11:28:35 - 11:28:44]
be Nave bias right so test out this is

[11:28:40 - 11:28:48]
one of the custom GPT that chat GPT Prov

[11:28:44 - 11:28:52]
provides for you okay now let's go and

[11:28:48 - 11:28:55]
check how to create your own GPT I

[11:28:52 - 11:29:00]
clicked on explore GPT and if you see

[11:28:55 - 11:29:02]
here apart from your gpts here the

[11:29:00 - 11:29:06]
custom gpts that chat gbt provides you

[11:29:02 - 11:29:10]
have a create option right you can click

[11:29:06 - 11:29:13]
on Create and next thing you know you

[11:29:10 - 11:29:15]
have this screen where you are creating

[11:29:13 - 11:29:18]
or configuring your your new GPD where

[11:29:15 - 11:29:21]
you give the name you give the features

[11:29:18 - 11:29:26]
all these things that you want to do

[11:29:21 - 11:29:28]
okay in create option you can interact

[11:29:26 - 11:29:31]
with chat GPD where it asks you a series

[11:29:28 - 11:29:34]
of questions like how may I help you and

[11:29:31 - 11:29:37]
just asking you that you want to make

[11:29:34 - 11:29:40]
creative uh you know uh something like

[11:29:37 - 11:29:43]
make a creative uh who helps generate

[11:29:40 - 11:29:45]
visuals for new products or you want to

[11:29:43 - 11:29:47]
make a software engineer who helps you

[11:29:45 - 11:29:51]
format uh your code what do you want to

[11:29:47 - 11:29:54]
do you can do this as in an interactive

[11:29:51 - 11:29:57]
format or if you have a direction in

[11:29:54 - 11:30:00]
your mind you can just put all the

[11:29:57 - 11:30:02]
details what is the name of the new gtpd

[11:30:00 - 11:30:04]
you want to create what is the

[11:30:02 - 11:30:06]
description what are the instructions

[11:30:04 - 11:30:09]
that it should follow what are the

[11:30:06 - 11:30:12]
conversation chapter that you saw right

[11:30:09 - 11:30:14]
it is optional you want to keep you keep

[11:30:12 - 11:30:16]
the knowledge you you can upload and

[11:30:14 - 11:30:19]
what are the capabilities you want to

[11:30:16 - 11:30:22]
include in that right so all these

[11:30:19 - 11:30:25]
things if you have a correct direction

[11:30:22 - 11:30:26]
you can directly fill it but if you do

[11:30:25 - 11:30:29]
not have correct direction you have just

[11:30:26 - 11:30:31]
overall an idea what to do and you know

[11:30:29 - 11:30:33]
how to you know what to create then you

[11:30:31 - 11:30:34]
can have a conversation and based on

[11:30:33 - 11:30:38]
your

[11:30:34 - 11:30:42]
conversation the chat GPT this feature

[11:30:38 - 11:30:46]
of chat GPT it updates your configure

[11:30:42 - 11:30:50]
part so here we would be creating a

[11:30:46 - 11:30:53]
sports Pro analytics gbd which analyzes

[11:30:50 - 11:30:55]
which would analyze all things for your

[11:30:53 - 11:30:58]
favorite sport be it Cricket be it

[11:30:55 - 11:31:01]
football whatever data you provide now I

[11:30:58 - 11:31:03]
want to create based on Cricket so I

[11:31:01 - 11:31:07]
have a description that Sports Pro

[11:31:03 - 11:31:12]
analytics interprets player performance

[11:31:07 - 11:31:16]
data generates statistical analysis and

[11:31:12 - 11:31:19]
offers Insight on team strategies it

[11:31:16 - 11:31:23]
predicts game outcomes evaluates player

[11:31:19 - 11:31:25]
Fitness and optimizes training regimes

[11:31:23 - 11:31:30]
additionally it provides detailed

[11:31:25 - 11:31:34]
breakdowns of game plays and performance

[11:31:30 - 11:31:38]
matric so whatever sport you are fond of

[11:31:34 - 11:31:41]
it can break down everything for you

[11:31:38 - 11:31:44]
from player performance to prediction of

[11:31:41 - 11:31:48]
your next game it is an exciting tool

[11:31:44 - 11:31:51]
for you so I have created the

[11:31:48 - 11:31:53]
description the instructions for this

[11:31:51 - 11:31:56]
already so the instructions my

[11:31:53 - 11:32:00]
instructions have what does this GPT do

[11:31:56 - 11:32:03]
how does it behave what should it avoid

[11:32:00 - 11:32:06]
doing I have all these things already

[11:32:03 - 11:32:10]
listed it down so I'll just copy paste

[11:32:06 - 11:32:13]
and give it okay that what does it do

[11:32:10 - 11:32:15]
player analysis I'll you know I'm

[11:32:13 - 11:32:17]
telling team strategy insights whatever

[11:32:15 - 11:32:20]
I have given I have given in bullet

[11:32:17 - 11:32:23]
pointers okay for this player uh

[11:32:20 - 11:32:25]
performance what needs to be done for

[11:32:23 - 11:32:27]
team strategy insights what needs to be

[11:32:25 - 11:32:31]
done what does not need to be done all

[11:32:27 - 11:32:34]
these things I have given that okay now

[11:32:31 - 11:32:36]
data your analytics should have data

[11:32:34 - 11:32:40]
driven approach so all these dos and

[11:32:36 - 11:32:44]
don'ts I have given as an instruction

[11:32:40 - 11:32:46]
already now as my knowledge I do not

[11:32:44 - 11:32:48]
want to do a conversation chter you can

[11:32:46 - 11:32:51]
keep any conversation chter you can uh

[11:32:48 - 11:32:55]
put as analyze your player performance

[11:32:51 - 11:32:57]
for example um you can keep

[11:32:55 - 11:32:59]
analyze

[11:32:57 - 11:33:00]
player

[11:32:59 - 11:33:03]
performance

[11:33:00 - 11:33:08]
okay you can do anything

[11:33:03 - 11:33:12]
check who will win for

[11:33:08 - 11:33:15]
example anything but I want I have a

[11:33:12 - 11:33:19]
data right now on Cricket I

[11:33:15 - 11:33:23]
want this GPT my custom GPT to be

[11:33:19 - 11:33:26]
trained on that data okay I'll upload

[11:33:23 - 11:33:30]
all my data cricket match data player

[11:33:26 - 11:33:33]
data team data fan data okay based on

[11:33:30 - 11:33:35]
fan based on uh Team Performance Based

[11:33:33 - 11:33:38]
on player performance what was the

[11:33:35 - 11:33:41]
performance what was the match I'll

[11:33:38 - 11:33:45]
upload that let me show you this data as

[11:33:41 - 11:33:48]
well for example your cricket team data

[11:33:45 - 11:33:51]
has random like India Australia England

[11:33:48 - 11:33:54]
and New Zealand how many matches it has

[11:33:51 - 11:33:56]
that team has played how many wins how

[11:33:54 - 11:33:59]
many loses how many draws what were the

[11:33:56 - 11:34:02]
score what were the runs what were the

[11:33:59 - 11:34:05]
wickets what is the economy rate what is

[11:34:02 - 11:34:09]
the Run rate right so like this we have

[11:34:05 - 11:34:12]
four different data sets with random

[11:34:09 - 11:34:14]
small data sets that I'm training it on

[11:34:12 - 11:34:16]
so let's go down and see the

[11:34:14 - 11:34:18]
capabilities ideally your code

[11:34:16 - 11:34:21]
interpreter and data analysis is not

[11:34:18 - 11:34:25]
ticked on you can take on uh code

[11:34:21 - 11:34:28]
interpreter and uh analysis then we have

[11:34:25 - 11:34:32]
create new action when you click on

[11:34:28 - 11:34:35]
this this is for if you want to have

[11:34:32 - 11:34:39]
your GPT custom GPT involved with a

[11:34:35 - 11:34:42]
database or schema or a website to be

[11:34:39 - 11:34:44]
integrated with that you can add the

[11:34:42 - 11:34:46]
authentication you can add the EMA you

[11:34:44 - 11:34:49]
can import the URL however you want to

[11:34:46 - 11:34:52]
do for this we are not doing this action

[11:34:49 - 11:34:55]
for additional it will ask you use

[11:34:52 - 11:34:57]
conversation data in your GPT to improve

[11:34:55 - 11:35:02]
a models that you take on right because

[11:34:57 - 11:35:05]
it will improve your GPT now if you

[11:35:02 - 11:35:08]
want to test it out you can message and

[11:35:05 - 11:35:12]
test it out if you want to directly

[11:35:08 - 11:35:14]
create create however I would suggest

[11:35:12 - 11:35:17]
you to test it out first on your preview

[11:35:14 - 11:35:20]
because you have a preview here you can

[11:35:17 - 11:35:24]
see as you write all the details you

[11:35:20 - 11:35:27]
will see this preview getting updated so

[11:35:24 - 11:35:29]
let me ask it the first prompt that

[11:35:27 - 11:35:31]
analyze the performance of verat kohi in

[11:35:29 - 11:35:37]
the last five

[11:35:31 - 11:35:39]
matches and it'll analyze it'll first go

[11:35:37 - 11:35:42]
analyze the data that you have we have

[11:35:39 - 11:35:45]
provided the knowledge and then it'll

[11:35:42 - 11:35:45]
give

[11:35:49 - 11:35:56]
the analysis that okay verat kohi has

[11:35:52 - 11:35:58]
played these many uh matches he has

[11:35:56 - 11:36:00]
scored these many runs this is the

[11:35:58 - 11:36:04]
batting average this is a strike rate

[11:36:00 - 11:36:07]
these are the catches okay now it asks

[11:36:04 - 11:36:10]
you would you like a detailed analysis

[11:36:07 - 11:36:13]
or visual representation of any specific

[11:36:10 - 11:36:16]
aspect of this data it'll give you

[11:36:13 - 11:36:19]
compare with his career averages show

[11:36:16 - 11:36:22]
based on your data you can analyze and

[11:36:19 - 11:36:24]
go on with that let's do some other

[11:36:22 - 11:36:27]
prompts as well so as it gives

[11:36:24 - 11:36:32]
strategies we ask what has been India's

[11:36:27 - 11:36:32]
key to sexcess in last five matches for

[11:36:37 - 11:36:44]
example so it gives you what has been

[11:36:41 - 11:36:47]
the Run rate what has been

[11:36:44 - 11:36:51]
matches played wickets taken economy

[11:36:47 - 11:36:54]
rate and it gives you the total okay in

[11:36:51 - 11:36:58]
the similar way you can analyze ask for

[11:36:54 - 11:37:00]
strategies that okay Australia what has

[11:36:58 - 11:37:03]
been the key strategy for Australia it

[11:37:00 - 11:37:05]
will analyze the data for you because

[11:37:03 - 11:37:08]
you are providing numerical data it'll

[11:37:05 - 11:37:12]
give you analysis so that's why it's

[11:37:08 - 11:37:14]
called Sports Pro analytics and by

[11:37:12 - 11:37:18]
creating by clicking the create button

[11:37:14 - 11:37:21]
you will create this GPD and you can

[11:37:18 - 11:37:23]
going forward you can edit it if you

[11:37:21 - 11:37:26]
have more data you can put more data on

[11:37:23 - 11:37:28]
it and as a knowledge base you can put

[11:37:26 - 11:37:31]
more data you can play around it and

[11:37:28 - 11:37:33]
it'll give you who will win who is going

[11:37:31 - 11:37:36]
to win in upcoming matches based on what

[11:37:33 - 11:37:41]
data you have provided this was all for

[11:37:36 - 11:37:45]
your demo on how you can create your own

[11:37:41 - 11:37:48]
GPT custom GPT and I hope this was only

[11:37:45 - 11:37:51]
a sports Pro analytics or analytics

[11:37:48 - 11:37:53]
based on analytics however you can be

[11:37:51 - 11:37:56]
more creative with your custom gpts

[11:37:53 - 11:38:00]
based on your requirements you can do

[11:37:56 - 11:38:03]
branding you can do campaigns gbt you

[11:38:00 - 11:38:07]
can explore how much and however you

[11:38:03 - 11:38:10]
want but the knowledge that you provide

[11:38:07 - 11:38:13]
the description that you provide the

[11:38:10 - 11:38:16]
instruction set what the chat GPT should

[11:38:13 - 11:38:19]
do what it should not do all these

[11:38:16 - 11:38:21]
things how you configure your GPT plays

[11:38:19 - 11:38:25]
a very important

[11:38:21 - 11:38:28]
role how your GPT performs for your

[11:38:25 - 11:38:31]
specialized task thanks for staying with

[11:38:28 - 11:38:34]
us throughout this video I hope you

[11:38:31 - 11:38:37]
understood what gpts are and how they

[11:38:34 - 11:38:39]
work we have journeyed from

[11:38:37 - 11:38:42]
understanding the basics of chart GPT to

[11:38:39 - 11:38:45]
diving deep into the Realms of

[11:38:42 - 11:38:49]
generative AI large language models and

[11:38:45 - 11:38:52]
