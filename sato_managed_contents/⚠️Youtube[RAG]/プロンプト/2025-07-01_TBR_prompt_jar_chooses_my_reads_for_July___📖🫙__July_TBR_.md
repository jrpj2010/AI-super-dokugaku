[00:04 - 00:08]
Hello, my sweet bestie angels. Welcome

[00:06 - 00:10]
back. I'm back in my library room and it

[00:08 - 00:11]
feels so good to be home. If you guys

[00:10 - 00:13]
have been keeping up with my vlogs,

[00:11 - 00:15]
you'll know that I was overseas for the

[00:13 - 00:18]
past few weeks and I had the best time

[00:15 - 00:20]
ever. But it does feel so good to be

[00:18 - 00:22]
home and like back into routine and back

[00:20 - 00:24]
into my normal things. And of course,

[00:22 - 00:28]
that means that we are back with another

[00:24 - 00:29]
TBR jar video because we have to like I

[00:28 - 00:31]
can't I can't miss out on this. This is

[00:29 - 00:33]
one of my favorite times of the month,

[00:31 - 00:34]
obviously. But before we get into the

[00:33 - 00:36]
monthly TBR, I did want to give a little

[00:34 - 00:38]
update on my merch that I launched with

[00:36 - 00:41]
Books with Jess a few weeks ago. I just

[00:38 - 00:43]
want to say we were quite literally

[00:41 - 00:46]
blown away at the response to this

[00:43 - 00:49]
collection. It far surpassed any

[00:46 - 00:51]
expectation that we had for this launch.

[00:49 - 00:52]
Like we had no idea how it was going to

[00:51 - 00:55]
go. I have personally never done

[00:52 - 00:56]
something like this with a brand. And so

[00:55 - 00:58]
we just like didn't know how it was

[00:56 - 01:00]
going to go. I was like, I will be happy

[00:58 - 01:03]
if one person makes an order. So, the

[01:00 - 01:05]
fact that we have had such an amazing

[01:03 - 01:07]
response and so many of you have made

[01:05 - 01:09]
orders is literally like mindboggling to

[01:07 - 01:10]
me. Like, I actually can't comprehend

[01:09 - 01:12]
it. But, I just want to say I am so

[01:10 - 01:14]
thankful. I am so so so thankful. It

[01:12 - 01:16]
truly just means the world to me and I

[01:14 - 01:18]
wish I could hug every single one of you

[01:16 - 01:19]
because you deserve it. Like, I need to

[01:18 - 01:21]
thank you all personally and I can't

[01:19 - 01:23]
believe that I can't do that. However,

[01:21 - 01:26]
since you guys just blew up Books with

[01:23 - 01:28]
Jess, we have had to make a few little

[01:26 - 01:30]
adjustments. The first being the

[01:28 - 01:32]
shipping time that we originally thought

[01:30 - 01:34]
has been extended because there have

[01:32 - 01:37]
just been so many orders and Book

[01:34 - 01:38]
Suggest is a small business and she is

[01:37 - 01:40]
working with a small team of people in

[01:38 - 01:42]
order to print and embroider and create

[01:40 - 01:44]
every single design and then ship it

[01:42 - 01:46]
off. And they are working as fast as

[01:44 - 01:48]
they can, but obviously there is a limit

[01:46 - 01:49]
to how fast they can work. And we still

[01:48 - 01:51]
obviously want to give you guys the best

[01:49 - 01:53]
quality possible. and they have also got

[01:51 - 01:55]
some extra help so that they can get it

[01:53 - 01:57]
done quicker. However, it is going to

[01:55 - 01:59]
take longer than we originally thought

[01:57 - 02:01]
it would just due to the capacity of the

[01:59 - 02:02]
orders. So, my apologies for that and

[02:01 - 02:04]
thank you guys for being so incredibly

[02:02 - 02:06]
patient. And the other little update

[02:04 - 02:09]
with that is Book Suggest Bookshop has

[02:06 - 02:11]
actually had to temporarily close down

[02:09 - 02:13]
the website so that they can catch up

[02:11 - 02:15]
with all of the orders that have already

[02:13 - 02:17]
been made. So, currently you can't order

[02:15 - 02:19]
anything from Book Suggest in general,

[02:17 - 02:21]
obviously, including my collection.

[02:19 - 02:23]
However, that is just a temporary little

[02:21 - 02:25]
moment so that they can catch up on all

[02:23 - 02:26]
of the orders and then everything will

[02:25 - 02:28]
go back to normal. So, if you were

[02:26 - 02:29]
planning to make an order and you

[02:28 - 02:31]
haven't got around to doing that yet,

[02:29 - 02:33]
don't worry. She will be back. And I'm

[02:31 - 02:35]
sure I will mention in a video and on

[02:33 - 02:36]
Instagram and things like that when the

[02:35 - 02:38]
website is back up and when the

[02:36 - 02:40]
collection is back up for sale. But

[02:38 - 02:41]
again, I am absolutely speechless with

[02:40 - 02:43]
the response we've had to this. It was

[02:41 - 02:46]
just so beyond any dream I could have

[02:43 - 02:47]
had for this collection and I am just so

[02:46 - 02:48]
thankful. There you go. I'm going to cry

[02:47 - 02:49]
if I think about it too much. So, I'm

[02:48 - 02:52]
just going to move on to the TBR.

[02:49 - 02:54]
Anyway, those are the updates from me.

[02:52 - 02:55]
Let's get on to the TBR. Jar, since I

[02:54 - 02:58]
was traveling last month, I'm not even

[02:55 - 03:01]
going to mention how badly I did on my

[02:58 - 03:02]
TBR last month. Like, it was abysmal.

[03:01 - 03:04]
Like, actually terrible. So, I'm hoping

[03:02 - 03:05]
this month will be a little bit more

[03:04 - 03:08]
successful, but I guess we'll wait and

[03:05 - 03:10]
see. I'm hoping I get some good prompts

[03:08 - 03:12]
here because we have a very full TBR

[03:10 - 03:14]
cart and I need to make some dents in

[03:12 - 03:15]
this. Like, I need to work on my

[03:14 - 03:21]
physical TBR this month. That is the

[03:15 - 03:22]
goal for Jul June. July June. No, July.

[03:21 - 03:26]
I'm a little bit not all there right

[03:22 - 03:28]
now. Anyway, July. Prompt number one. Oh

[03:26 - 03:31]
gosh, that is not one prompt. A book

[03:28 - 03:32]
with a number in the title. Wait, I just

[03:31 - 03:35]
realized I haven't put some books on

[03:32 - 03:37]
here. I have some books that I have from

[03:35 - 03:39]
bookmail that I haven't added to the TBR

[03:37 - 03:41]
cart yet, and I can't because there's no

[03:39 - 03:43]
room. So, we're going to put them behind

[03:41 - 03:45]
here. But one of the books that could

[03:43 - 03:46]
work for this prompt is releasing 10.

[03:45 - 03:48]
Let's see if I have any other that could

[03:46 - 03:50]
work. It's not looking good. The three

[03:48 - 03:52]
lives of Kate K. We could do that cuz

[03:50 - 03:53]
obviously it has the word three. Okay,

[03:52 - 03:55]
so it looks like our two options are

[03:53 - 03:56]
either releasing 10 or the three lives

[03:55 - 04:00]
of KK. And I think I'm going to do

[03:56 - 04:02]
releasing 10. This is a chunky book so

[04:00 - 04:04]
it's going to take me a hot minute to

[04:02 - 04:05]
get through it. However, I really want

[04:04 - 04:07]
to get to this soon. I have been

[04:05 - 04:09]
avoiding spoilers for this like the

[04:07 - 04:11]
plague. Like I have been running from

[04:09 - 04:13]
any Tik Tok that shows on my for you

[04:11 - 04:15]
page that mentions this book because I

[04:13 - 04:17]
just don't want to hear anything until

[04:15 - 04:18]
I've read it and then I can dive into

[04:17 - 04:20]
all of the spoilers, all of the Tik

[04:18 - 04:22]
Toks, all of the book videos, all of it.

[04:20 - 04:24]
But right now, I'm trying to stay away.

[04:22 - 04:27]
I do know that people said that this one

[04:24 - 04:29]
hurts and I'm scared for that. Like, am

[04:27 - 04:30]
I ready for that? I'm not sure. But I

[04:29 - 04:31]
obviously need to read it. I obviously

[04:30 - 04:33]
need to continue the series and I

[04:31 - 04:35]
obviously need Lizzy and Hugh story. I

[04:33 - 04:37]
honestly don't know how I'm going to

[04:35 - 04:39]
feel about it. Like I really am going in

[04:37 - 04:41]
with like caution, I guess. Like I

[04:39 - 04:42]
really don't know what my thoughts are

[04:41 - 04:44]
going to be, but I hope it's as good as

[04:42 - 04:46]
the rest of the series. Prompt number

[04:44 - 04:49]
two,

[04:46 - 04:52]
read the most recent edition to your

[04:49 - 04:54]
TBR. Okay, so while I was away, I did do

[04:52 - 04:56]
a little bit of book shopping. And the

[04:54 - 04:58]
books that I did buy were My Friends by

[04:56 - 05:01]
Frederick Bachman just last night by

[04:58 - 05:03]
Vari McFaran. And I think that's it. I

[05:01 - 05:05]
did buy some other books, but they're

[05:03 - 05:06]
like ones that I've already read, so

[05:05 - 05:08]
they're already on the shelf, you know?

[05:06 - 05:10]
Wow. I really thought I would have more.

[05:08 - 05:12]
But these are my two most recent

[05:10 - 05:14]
editions. If I want to get technical

[05:12 - 05:17]
about it, I bought this one first and

[05:14 - 05:21]
this one's second. So, this one is the

[05:17 - 05:23]
most recent addition to my TBR. However,

[05:21 - 05:27]
can I just like choose between them or

[05:23 - 05:29]
do I like should I go h I think I'm

[05:27 - 05:30]
going to do this one because that is

[05:29 - 05:32]
like the answer to the prompt. if you

[05:30 - 05:34]
know what I mean. Like the prompt said

[05:32 - 05:36]
the most recent edition and this is the

[05:34 - 05:39]
most recent edition. This I bought like

[05:36 - 05:41]
literally on the last night of my trip.

[05:39 - 05:43]
I really love the US editions of Vari

[05:41 - 05:45]
McFarland's books way more than I like

[05:43 - 05:47]
the UK versions. I bought Between Us

[05:45 - 05:48]
when I was in the US last year and I

[05:47 - 05:49]
just feel like they're going to look so

[05:48 - 05:51]
cute on my shelf together. Anyway,

[05:49 - 05:52]
that's not important. I knew I wanted to

[05:51 - 05:53]
get one of her books while I was there

[05:52 - 05:55]
and I specifically wanted to get this

[05:53 - 05:57]
one and I went into Barnes & Noble on

[05:55 - 05:59]
like the second last day of our trip and

[05:57 - 06:01]
they didn't have it. even though when I

[05:59 - 06:02]
went earlier in the trip, they did have

[06:01 - 06:04]
it. So, I just missed out and I was so

[06:02 - 06:06]
annoyed about it cuz in my head, like at

[06:04 - 06:07]
the back of my mind, I was like planning

[06:06 - 06:08]
on coming back for this book the entire

[06:07 - 06:10]
time I was in New York. And then I came

[06:08 - 06:12]
back for it and it wasn't there. So,

[06:10 - 06:14]
literally the last night of our trip, we

[06:12 - 06:16]
just picked up dinner and I said to the

[06:14 - 06:17]
girls, "Girls, you go back to the hotel.

[06:16 - 06:19]
I'm going to go to Strand and I'm going

[06:17 - 06:20]
to see if they have this book that I

[06:19 - 06:23]
can't stop thinking about." So, I went

[06:20 - 06:25]
on a little solo adventure to Strand at

[06:23 - 06:27]
like I don't even know 7:00 p.m. at

[06:25 - 06:29]
night and they had one copy left of this

[06:27 - 06:31]
book. So, of course, I grabbed it and

[06:29 - 06:32]
I'm so happy that I got it. I am a

[06:31 - 06:33]
little bit nervous about this one, too,

[06:32 - 06:35]
because I've heard that it is really

[06:33 - 06:36]
sad, but I've also heard that it's

[06:35 - 06:38]
really good. I've read three of Vari

[06:36 - 06:40]
McFarland's books so far. This will be

[06:38 - 06:44]
the fourth. And her books, I would say,

[06:40 - 06:45]
are very much more fiction than romance,

[06:44 - 06:46]
even though they're always in the

[06:45 - 06:48]
romance section, at least at all the

[06:46 - 06:49]
bookstores that I've been to. I feel

[06:48 - 06:52]
like they always have a romance in them,

[06:49 - 06:54]
but they're so much more like fiction.

[06:52 - 06:57]
so much more like about characters and

[06:54 - 06:59]
about the character development of the

[06:57 - 07:01]
main character or like the storyline,

[06:59 - 07:03]
the complex relationships, the

[07:01 - 07:05]
friendships, the family, the like

[07:03 - 07:07]
finding themselves kind of situation

[07:05 - 07:08]
much more than it is about the romance,

[07:07 - 07:10]
at least in the ones that I've read so

[07:08 - 07:11]
far. So, if you are going to pick up her

[07:10 - 07:12]
books, I would definitely say don't go

[07:11 - 07:15]
in expecting a romcom. Like they're

[07:12 - 07:16]
usually quite like heavyhitting and just

[07:15 - 07:18]
like make you think, which I really

[07:16 - 07:21]
really enjoy. But I'm very intrigued to

[07:18 - 07:22]
read this one cuz yeah, I've heard a lot

[07:21 - 07:24]
about it and I just love the color. I

[07:22 - 07:26]
love the yellow and blue. I'm obsessed

[07:24 - 07:28]
with that color combo. But I am also

[07:26 - 07:31]
hoping that I get to this one soon.

[07:28 - 07:35]
However, I do have a plan in my brain

[07:31 - 07:37]
about some potential Frederick Bachman

[07:35 - 07:39]
reading endeavors coming up. So, we'll

[07:37 - 07:42]
see if that fits in the TBR or not. I

[07:39 - 07:45]
don't know. Number three, Jewel POV.

[07:42 - 07:48]
Okay, that's kind of fun. I have no idea

[07:45 - 07:50]
what I have on here that is dual POV,

[07:48 - 07:52]
but we'll check. I really want to read

[07:50 - 07:53]
Promise Me Sunshine. Is this No. Is Out

[07:52 - 07:55]
of the Woods. I feel like this probably

[07:53 - 07:57]
won't be. No. Picking Daisies on

[07:55 - 08:00]
Sundays. I feel like this probably

[07:57 - 08:03]
won't. No. Our Infinite Fates. No. The

[08:00 - 08:06]
Serpent and the Wolf. Nope. Cool. Cool.

[08:03 - 08:08]
Cool. Um,

[08:06 - 08:11]
okay. We found one. This is Eat Your

[08:08 - 08:13]
Heart Out by Victoria Brown Lee. Let me

[08:11 - 08:14]
just see if we have any other options.

[08:13 - 08:16]
on this list. I feel like it's always

[08:14 - 08:18]
got to be like a romcom or like a

[08:16 - 08:19]
romance of some kind. Usually, actually,

[08:18 - 08:22]
I guess some fantasy maybe. Okay, this

[08:19 - 08:25]
one is not it. Um I feel like Annabelle

[08:22 - 08:27]
Monahan is not usually. Oh, it is. Okay,

[08:25 - 08:29]
we could do this one same time next

[08:27 - 08:31]
summer. Ooh, okay. We have a fantasy

[08:29 - 08:33]
option here. This is The Silvered

[08:31 - 08:35]
Serpents and this is the second book in

[08:33 - 08:37]
the What is this series called? I

[08:35 - 08:39]
forget. The Gilded Wolf series. Okay,

[08:37 - 08:41]
that gives us at least three options.

[08:39 - 08:43]
What do I feel like reading right now?

[08:41 - 08:45]
We have two kind of heavier books. So,

[08:43 - 08:47]
do I go with something like quick and

[08:45 - 08:49]
easy? I am very intrigued by this one

[08:47 - 08:52]
because I'm pretty sure it's set in the

[08:49 - 08:54]
French Riviera. Deliciously fun, witty

[08:52 - 08:56]
romcom set against the backdrop of Paris

[08:54 - 08:59]
and the French Riviera, which I may or

[08:56 - 09:01]
may not be visiting sometime soon. I

[08:59 - 09:03]
don't know. And I think that would be

[09:01 - 09:04]
really fun. But it's also like such a

[09:03 - 09:07]
summary book. Or like do I want to save

[09:04 - 09:09]
it to read on my potential trip to

[09:07 - 09:11]
potentially maybe France? Annabelle

[09:09 - 09:12]
Monahan, you just like can't go wrong.

[09:11 - 09:14]
And I honestly haven't heard great

[09:12 - 09:15]
things about this one. Like I feel like

[09:14 - 09:16]
it's everyone's least favorite. So I'm

[09:15 - 09:19]
like, do I just like get it over and

[09:16 - 09:20]
done with? I kind of I think I am going

[09:19 - 09:22]
to put this one cuz I feel like

[09:20 - 09:24]
Annabelle Monahan, they're just like so

[09:22 - 09:26]
quick and so easy to read, but still

[09:24 - 09:27]
just like great books. Like her writing

[09:26 - 09:29]
is like she's one of my favorite authors

[09:27 - 09:31]
in terms of just like her writing. And

[09:29 - 09:33]
this is under 300 pages, which I'm just

[09:31 - 09:35]
like sometimes you need a quick little

[09:33 - 09:37]
book on your TBR, don't you? I am very

[09:35 - 09:39]
nervous for this one because I'm pretty

[09:37 - 09:42]
sure the main character is like falling

[09:39 - 09:44]
in love with someone whilst she already

[09:42 - 09:45]
has a different partner and that just

[09:44 - 09:47]
doesn't sound very good to me. It says

[09:45 - 09:50]
on paper Sam's life is on track. She has

[09:47 - 09:51]
the perfect fiance, a stable job and has

[09:50 - 09:53]
returned home to pick out a wedding

[09:51 - 09:54]
venue near her family's Long Island

[09:53 - 09:56]
beach house. That is kind of fun though

[09:54 - 09:57]
that it's set on Long Island. Like I do

[09:56 - 09:59]
really like that. The last person she

[09:57 - 10:00]
expects to see is Wyatt, her first love

[09:59 - 10:02]
and the man who broke her heart. As

[10:00 - 10:04]
their irresistible spark comes rushing

[10:02 - 10:06]
back, so do the memories of long nights

[10:04 - 10:08]
spent in the treehouse and the summer

[10:06 - 10:11]
that changed everything. E. Oh, I just

[10:08 - 10:13]
wish she didn't have a fiance, you know.

[10:11 - 10:15]
But I am intrigued. We'll see. But I

[10:13 - 10:17]
think I'm going to add this officially

[10:15 - 10:19]
to my July TBR. Great. Let's read a

[10:17 - 10:21]
summer book in the middle of winter in

[10:19 - 10:22]
Australia. That sounds fantastic. I

[10:21 - 10:24]
mean, when do I not do that? I feel like

[10:22 - 10:27]
I do that every year because all of the

[10:24 - 10:28]
American summer romances come out in the

[10:27 - 10:30]
middle of the year, obviously during

[10:28 - 10:31]
their summer, which is always during our

[10:30 - 10:33]
winter, but I want to read them cuz

[10:31 - 10:36]
they're new releases. That one is not a

[10:33 - 10:37]
new release. But I I think you can't be

[10:36 - 10:39]
that much of like a seasonal reader when

[10:37 - 10:41]
you live in Australia because all of our

[10:39 - 10:43]
seasons are like backwards, especially

[10:41 - 10:45]
compared to like most of the American

[10:43 - 10:46]
authors that are releasing books. So,

[10:45 - 10:49]
you just got to learn to accept it at

[10:46 - 10:51]
that point. Anyway, prompt number four.

[10:49 - 10:54]
Ooh, this prompt is called taste test

[10:51 - 10:56]
and it says read three first chapters

[10:54 - 10:58]
and choose your favorite. Interesting.

[10:56 - 11:01]
So, I have to pick out three books. Read

[10:58 - 11:03]
the first chapter and pick one based on

[11:01 - 11:05]
that. I'm going to do Promise Me

[11:03 - 11:06]
Sunshine cuz I've been dying to read

[11:05 - 11:08]
this for so long. Wait, this is hard.

[11:06 - 11:10]
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Out of the Woods

[11:08 - 11:12]
as well. And then maybe If We Were

[11:10 - 11:15]
Villains. I feel like that could be a

[11:12 - 11:17]
really interesting winter book to read

[11:15 - 11:18]
during like a cold day. Cozy up and read

[11:17 - 11:20]
this book. I've heard incredible things

[11:18 - 11:22]
about this one and I've just I've never

[11:20 - 11:23]
read it obviously and I'm very intrigued

[11:22 - 11:25]
by it. So, I'm going to read the first

[11:23 - 11:26]
chapter of each of these. I might

[11:25 - 11:28]
actually just read like the first page

[11:26 - 11:30]
of each of these just for the sake of

[11:28 - 11:34]
time and then we'll choose our favorite.

[11:30 - 11:40]
And by we, I mean me.

[11:34 - 11:41]
[Music]

[11:40 - 11:44]
Honestly, I think this has made me

[11:41 - 11:46]
realize that I need to start reading

[11:44 - 11:48]
like the first couple pages of a book

[11:46 - 11:50]
more often before like actually starting

[11:48 - 11:52]
it because these three books have been

[11:50 - 11:54]
sitting on my TBR cart for months. Like

[11:52 - 11:56]
all of them have been sitting on my TBR

[11:54 - 11:58]
cart for months and they all have

[11:56 - 12:00]
incredibly interesting first few pages

[11:58 - 12:02]
and I feel like if I had picked up any

[12:00 - 12:04]
of them and read the first couple of

[12:02 - 12:05]
pages at any other point, I would have

[12:04 - 12:06]
been like, "Oh my gosh, I need to read

[12:05 - 12:08]
this right now and I can't believe it's

[12:06 - 12:09]
taken me this long because they all

[12:08 - 12:11]
sound so good." And now I'm like, I

[12:09 - 12:13]
don't even know which one I want to put

[12:11 - 12:14]
like officially on my TBR. Honestly, I

[12:13 - 12:16]
want these to be like the other three

[12:14 - 12:17]
books that I put on my TBR because I

[12:16 - 12:19]
want to read them right now. I mean,

[12:17 - 12:20]
obviously maybe I can fit some of the

[12:19 - 12:23]
other ones into a different prompt or

[12:20 - 12:25]
something, but for this prompt, I think

[12:23 - 12:26]
the one that stood out to me the most

[12:25 - 12:28]
surprisingly honestly, well, at least

[12:26 - 12:30]
like surprisingly to me, was Out of the

[12:28 - 12:33]
Woods by Hannah Bonham Young. I think

[12:30 - 12:35]
just the first couple pages really got

[12:33 - 12:37]
me intrigued. Firstly, because the

[12:35 - 12:39]
dedication says, "For all my fellow Amy

[12:37 - 12:41]
March girls out there, you don't have to

[12:39 - 12:43]
be great or nothing. You can just be."

[12:41 - 12:45]
And if you don't know, Amy March is from

[12:43 - 12:47]
Little Women. And I don't know if she is

[12:45 - 12:50]
like my favorite character out of Little

[12:47 - 12:51]
Women. Like I I love all of them. I love

[12:50 - 12:53]
all of the sisters so incredibly much.

[12:51 - 12:54]
Like I don't know if like she is like my

[12:53 - 12:56]
person, if you know what I mean. But I

[12:54 - 12:57]
feel like the fact that she just

[12:56 - 12:59]
referenced one of my favorite books got

[12:57 - 13:01]
me hooked immediately. And then there's

[12:59 - 13:03]
a little author's note at the beginning

[13:01 - 13:05]
which first of all says she recommends

[13:03 - 13:06]
reading Out on a Limb before reading Out

[13:05 - 13:08]
of the Woods because it links to that

[13:06 - 13:09]
story which I have read and I loved Out

[13:08 - 13:12]
on a Limb. It was a five-star read for

[13:09 - 13:14]
me. But it also says she wrote Out on a

[13:12 - 13:16]
Limb based on a lot of her own

[13:14 - 13:18]
experiences and she didn't really expect

[13:16 - 13:19]
to write another book that was so

[13:18 - 13:21]
personal to her. But then these

[13:19 - 13:23]
characters came along, Sarah and Caleb,

[13:21 - 13:24]
who you meet in Out on a Limb because

[13:23 - 13:26]
they are best friends with the main

[13:24 - 13:28]
characters in that book. and it ended up

[13:26 - 13:30]
being a really personal story for her to

[13:28 - 13:33]
write as well because this book is about

[13:30 - 13:35]
Sarah and Caleb who have been married

[13:33 - 13:37]
for a long time, but it's like a romance

[13:35 - 13:38]
book. It's not even like second chance

[13:37 - 13:40]
because I don't know how to explain it.

[13:38 - 13:42]
But it's a story about people who have

[13:40 - 13:45]
already been together, but then I think

[13:42 - 13:47]
they like find themselves/find each

[13:45 - 13:48]
other all over again, which is such an

[13:47 - 13:49]
interesting premise to me. But at the

[13:48 - 13:51]
beginning of the book, it says, "My

[13:49 - 13:52]
husband Ben and I began dating in high

[13:51 - 13:55]
school and got married when I was 18,

[13:52 - 13:56]
which in hindsight is a bat crazy thing

[13:55 - 13:57]
to do. Thankfully, we're still happy

[13:56 - 13:59]
together. Not without effort, not

[13:57 - 14:01]
without painful lessons, not without

[13:59 - 14:02]
struggle. But ultimately, I'm lucky to

[14:01 - 14:04]
say that I'm married to my best friend.

[14:02 - 14:05]
There is no one whom I'd rather spend my

[14:04 - 14:07]
time with. No one who can make me laugh

[14:05 - 14:08]
harder or make me feel safer. We were

[14:07 - 14:10]
just among the lucky few who met their

[14:08 - 14:12]
person a little too young, which is the

[14:10 - 14:14]
inspiration for this novel. Out of the

[14:12 - 14:16]
Woods is my love letter to any of us who

[14:14 - 14:17]
met their soulmate before they had the

[14:16 - 14:19]
chance to fully meet themselves." And

[14:17 - 14:22]
that is so interesting to me. I feel

[14:19 - 14:24]
like that is such a unique premise for a

[14:22 - 14:25]
book. Like I have never read anything

[14:24 - 14:26]
like that before. And that got me

[14:25 - 14:28]
hooked. I'm not going to lie. Like

[14:26 - 14:30]
reading that little dedication, I was

[14:28 - 14:31]
like, I need to read this right this

[14:30 - 14:32]
second. For those of you who don't know,

[14:31 - 14:34]
because I feel like I mention it every

[14:32 - 14:35]
now and then. And every time I mention

[14:34 - 14:37]
it, people are like, "What? I didn't

[14:35 - 14:40]
know this." But I am married and I met

[14:37 - 14:41]
my now husband when I was 15 years old.

[14:40 - 14:44]
We met in high school. We started

[14:41 - 14:46]
dating. We got engaged at 21, married at

[14:44 - 14:47]
22. Now I'm 27. And I am utterly

[14:46 - 14:49]
obsessed with my husband. And like

[14:47 - 14:50]
marrying Liam was the best decision I've

[14:49 - 14:52]
ever made and there has never been one

[14:50 - 14:53]
second where I've regretted it. But I am

[14:52 - 14:55]
aware that we were very young when we

[14:53 - 14:57]
met and when we fell in love and when we

[14:55 - 14:59]
got married. And so reading a book about

[14:57 - 15:02]
a couple who fell in love really young

[14:59 - 15:04]
and just like reading their story is

[15:02 - 15:05]
very intriguing to me. So I think I I

[15:04 - 15:07]
think I'm going to pick this. I don't

[15:05 - 15:09]
know if I'll be able to relate to these

[15:07 - 15:10]
characters and to their story. Like I

[15:09 - 15:12]
don't know if it's going to be like a

[15:10 - 15:14]
personal thing for me. But at least like

[15:12 - 15:16]
the premise of it seems quite personal

[15:14 - 15:17]
to me. So I'm intrigued. But I really

[15:16 - 15:19]
want to read these two. So maybe we'll

[15:17 - 15:21]
be able to make these fit in another

[15:19 - 15:24]
prompt. Hopefully we have two books left

[15:21 - 15:28]
to choose. So prompt number five, a

[15:24 - 15:29]
cover that you love. That is so fun. I

[15:28 - 15:31]
love getting like a really fun prompt

[15:29 - 15:33]
where I can just kind of choose

[15:31 - 15:34]
anything. There are so many covers that

[15:33 - 15:36]
I love. We have like quite a few

[15:34 - 15:39]
romances. Yeah, they're all romances

[15:36 - 15:41]
actually on our TBR so far. I guess Vari

[15:39 - 15:42]
Mcfaren is a bit more fictiony, but like

[15:41 - 15:44]
overall it's kind of like romanceheavy,

[15:42 - 15:47]
so maybe I should pick something a

[15:44 - 15:49]
little different. You know what? I think

[15:47 - 15:51]
I kind of want to go with Cruel is the

[15:49 - 15:54]
Light. I have this ARC copy that I

[15:51 - 15:57]
received months ago. And I just think

[15:54 - 15:59]
the art style on this ARC is beautiful.

[15:57 - 16:01]
This is not the actual final copy. I'll

[15:59 - 16:03]
show you the final copy. This is also a

[16:01 - 16:05]
beautiful cover as well. I mean, it

[16:03 - 16:08]
definitely has like similar art styles

[16:05 - 16:10]
and like the image itself is the same,

[16:08 - 16:12]
but I just think this is just such a

[16:10 - 16:14]
beautiful copy, so I kind of kind of

[16:12 - 16:15]
want to read this. And this is just a

[16:14 - 16:19]
little bit different to anything I have

[16:15 - 16:21]
on my TBR right now. This is a YA

[16:19 - 16:23]
fantasy romanty. A brutal war between

[16:21 - 16:25]
demons and humanity has raged across

[16:23 - 16:29]
Europe for a century. At its heart are

[16:25 - 16:31]
two elite soldiers. Selene Al Olivia

[16:29 - 16:33]
Aliva, a powerful exorcist trained at

[16:31 - 16:36]
the prestigious Vatican Academy and foot

[16:33 - 16:38]
soldier Jules Lacroy, unrivaled in

[16:36 - 16:40]
battle. When their paths cross, despite

[16:38 - 16:42]
initial distrust, then unwelcome

[16:40 - 16:44]
attraction, Jules and Seline discover a

[16:42 - 16:46]
terrible secret at the heart of the holy

[16:44 - 16:48]
Vatican City. Interesting. It says,

[16:46 - 16:49]
"Perfect for fans of powerless

[16:48 - 16:51]
fourthwing and divine rivals." I guess

[16:49 - 16:53]
we'll see. I feel like they put that on

[16:51 - 16:55]
the back of every YA fantasy book ever.

[16:53 - 16:57]
But I'm intrigued. I am intrigued. I've

[16:55 - 16:58]
heard like mixed reviews about this. I

[16:57 - 17:00]
do remember one of my friends, Freya,

[16:58 - 17:01]
she read this and at the beginning she

[17:00 - 17:04]
said that it kind of gave her like

[17:01 - 17:05]
Cassandra Cla energy and that sold me.

[17:04 - 17:08]
But then I think she didn't end up like

[17:05 - 17:09]
loving loving it. But you know what? I'm

[17:08 - 17:11]
still intrigued and I've been meaning to

[17:09 - 17:13]
get to this for a long time and I I feel

[17:11 - 17:15]
like it meets this prompt. So maybe this

[17:13 - 17:19]
month will be the month. And last

[17:15 - 17:21]
prompt, prompt number six is a book

[17:19 - 17:23]
title that starts with the first letter

[17:21 - 17:25]
of the month. So obviously this is a TBR

[17:23 - 17:28]
for July. So, we have to find something

[17:25 - 17:31]
that starts with J, which is proving to

[17:28 - 17:34]
be a little difficult. Okay. Well, we

[17:31 - 17:36]
don't have one. Okay. Um, I'm going to

[17:34 - 17:38]
pick another prompt because there is

[17:36 - 17:39]
nothing here that starts with J. Am I

[17:38 - 17:41]
being blind? I feel like sometimes I do

[17:39 - 17:42]
that. Like, I say, "Oh, there's nothing

[17:41 - 17:43]
on here that matches the prompt." And

[17:42 - 17:44]
then someone's like, "It literally was

[17:43 - 17:46]
right in front of you." We have like

[17:44 - 17:48]
authors that start with J, but I guess

[17:46 - 17:50]
we'll try again. I feel like it's pretty

[17:48 - 17:52]
rare that I don't have something that

[17:50 - 17:55]
meets the prompt. Prompt number six,

[17:52 - 17:57]
take two. A person on the cover.

[17:55 - 17:59]
I really want to read this book. Can you

[17:57 - 18:01]
tell? We have this. We could do My

[17:59 - 18:02]
Friends. I know that has people on the

[18:01 - 18:04]
cover. We probably have a lot of options

[18:02 - 18:05]
for this. Am I just going to go with No,

[18:04 - 18:07]
I should look at the others. I could do

[18:05 - 18:09]
Persuasion by Jane Austin. Has a man on

[18:07 - 18:11]
the cover. We have a few here actually.

[18:09 - 18:13]
Like actually quite a few. But I think I

[18:11 - 18:14]
still just want to read Promise Me

[18:13 - 18:15]
Sunshine again. I've been meaning to

[18:14 - 18:18]
read this for so long. I've heard such

[18:15 - 18:20]
incredible reviews. I have no idea why I

[18:18 - 18:21]
haven't picked it up yet. So I think I

[18:20 - 18:23]
think I'm going to read Promise Me

[18:21 - 18:25]
Sunshine. This is a really romanceheavy

[18:23 - 18:27]
TBR this month, but I'm not mad at it. I

[18:25 - 18:31]
feel like sometimes you just need a good

[18:27 - 18:33]
romcom, a good romance. I loved Ready or

[18:31 - 18:35]
Not by Cara Bastone, who is the author

[18:33 - 18:36]
of Promise Me Sunshine. And so, I feel

[18:35 - 18:37]
like this is one of those books where I

[18:36 - 18:39]
was like, I'm going to read this as soon

[18:37 - 18:40]
as it's released and now it's like 3

[18:39 - 18:42]
months later and I still haven't read

[18:40 - 18:44]
it. But yeah, I loved Ready or Not. I

[18:42 - 18:45]
loved the romance. I loved the

[18:44 - 18:47]
characters. I feel like the way it was

[18:45 - 18:48]
written was so fun. It was so witty. And

[18:47 - 18:50]
I'm really hoping that this gives me

[18:48 - 18:53]
similar energy. I know that it's

[18:50 - 18:56]
following a story about a girl who has

[18:53 - 18:58]
just lost her best friend and that

[18:56 - 19:00]
stresses me out a little bit because I'm

[18:58 - 19:02]
just like that is really heavy. Like

[19:00 - 19:03]
that is really sad. And I feel like one

[19:02 - 19:06]
of the other books on this list actually

[19:03 - 19:07]
follows something kind of similar. But I

[19:06 - 19:09]
am intrigued by this because it says

[19:07 - 19:11]
Miles sees right through her. He knows a

[19:09 - 19:13]
lot about grief and offers her a deal.

[19:11 - 19:15]
He'll help her complete her live again

[19:13 - 19:17]
list if she'll help him reconnect with

[19:15 - 19:18]
Ansley and his sister. Lenny doubts

[19:17 - 19:20]
anything can help, but as she begins to

[19:18 - 19:22]
spend more time with Miles, she begins

[19:20 - 19:24]
to see that sometimes losing everything

[19:22 - 19:26]
can be the first step in finding

[19:24 - 19:27]
yourself again. And I just have a

[19:26 - 19:29]
feeling it's going to be just beautiful.

[19:27 - 19:31]
I know one of my best friends, Sofh,

[19:29 - 19:33]
loved this, so I'm excited, but I'm also

[19:31 - 19:35]
a little nervous. I feel like when you

[19:33 - 19:36]
just have an author that you love, like

[19:35 - 19:38]
either one of their other books or

[19:36 - 19:40]
multiple of their other books, it almost

[19:38 - 19:42]
puts like more pressure on reading

[19:40 - 19:43]
another book or like a new release from

[19:42 - 19:45]
them because you just have such high

[19:43 - 19:46]
expectations. So, I'm trying to play it

[19:45 - 19:48]
cool. like, oh, maybe I'll like it,

[19:46 - 19:49]
maybe I won't. Like, who knows? But deep

[19:48 - 19:51]
down, I'm like, I hope I love this.

[19:49 - 19:54]
Like, I really hope I love this. All

[19:51 - 19:58]
right, TBR is complete. Let me reshuffle

[19:54 - 19:58]
and then we'll do a recap.

[19:58 - 20:03]
First of all, we have Releasing 10.

[20:00 - 20:06]
Next, we have Just Last Night, Same Time

[20:03 - 20:09]
Next Summer, Out of the Woods, Cruel is

[20:06 - 20:12]
a Light, and finally, Promise Me

[20:09 - 20:14]
Sunshine. And that is our final official

[20:12 - 20:16]
TBR for July. I'm really excited about

[20:14 - 20:18]
this TBR. I feel really intrigued by all

[20:16 - 20:20]
of these books. Like I want to pick them

[20:18 - 20:21]
all up right now, which is a very good

[20:20 - 20:23]
sign. So hopefully that means a very

[20:21 - 20:25]
successful TBR month, especially

[20:23 - 20:26]
following one that was not so

[20:25 - 20:28]
successful. I feel like I'm going to put

[20:26 - 20:30]
a real emphasis on reading my physical

[20:28 - 20:32]
TBR this month because again, the TBR

[20:30 - 20:34]
cart is getting full and I don't like it

[20:32 - 20:36]
when it's like overflowing. I try to

[20:34 - 20:37]
keep it somewhat reasonable. I mean,

[20:36 - 20:40]
obviously I still have a lot of books on

[20:37 - 20:41]
this TBR cart, but I like to have it not

[20:40 - 20:43]
too packed. Let me know if there are any

[20:41 - 20:46]
other books on this cart that you're

[20:43 - 20:47]
like, "Rachel, please read that book.

[20:46 - 20:48]
Like, you need to read this right now."

[20:47 - 20:50]
I'm still trying to decide what kind of

[20:48 - 20:52]
reading vlogs I want to film this month.

[20:50 - 20:53]
So, if there are any books that you

[20:52 - 20:55]
specifically want to see in a future

[20:53 - 20:56]
video, let me know because you may or

[20:55 - 20:59]
may not see it featured. But, I love you

[20:56 - 21:01]
all so so much. Like, truly so, so much.

[20:59 - 21:05]
And I guess I'll see you guys in my next

[21:01 - 21:05]
video very soon. Goodbye.

Met my husband at 9, started dating at 16, got married at 25, and now I’m almost 44 and we’re still going strong. It is weird, but also amazing, when you meet YOUR person so early. I’ve been with my husband for 28 years all together. 💗

I've literally been in the worst slump in June, this has motivated me SOOOO much to continue my reading goal!!

Hi Rachel! I just wanted to comment abt A Winter's Promise because, as a French book girlie, this is one of our most prized possession. This book is INCREDIBLE. I've never read any fantasy like this, the world is so unique and beautiful and magical and I have vivid memories of some landscapes even though it's been five years since I've read the first book. The characters are perfect because they have many flaws but they are so touching. The main character especially I really really loved, she's clumsy and awkward, shy and really smart, she's not the typical "i'm so pretty and fierce but no one will notice me", I was so proud of her and wanted to hug her throughout the book. The romance is such a slow-burn, but it's really beautiful and I fell in love with their relationship, and all the plot-twists and the creation of this Universe...
Sorry this is way too long but I really hope you'll read it soon and enjoy it because it's spectacular. 
You're so pretty and you seem so kind and pure, I love you videos so much take care of yourself and congrats on the merch 🫶🫶

### 15. @IndianBollywood1 (👍 12)
when you come to the UK you really need to go 66 books - its basically a book warehouse that's only open 2 weekends a month to the public and the books are 70% off retail price!

> **@squidwardtentacles7144** (👍 0): Literally, my main reason to go to the UK. I'd love to go to 66 Books!😭

### 16. @maevestowe4683 (👍 2)
Great TBR this month Rachel! Can’t wait to see you read promise me sunshine, it’s incredible!

### 17. @maddimarina (👍 0)
out of the woods made me bawl multiple times, it’s such a beautiful story (with some fun thrown in of course) but you just reading the authors note made me tear up remembering it. truly such a 5 star read for me!

### 18. @chanelalexandra (👍 3)
I was just thinking we neeeeeed another Rach book video 🥹🫶

### 19. @daphne.readsnl (👍 1)
Aahh so good to see you back in the library room! 😍 Such a fun video 🥰

Out of the Woods was one of my favorite books so far this year and got me out of a long reading slump - hope you enjoy it!
