[00:00 - 00:04]
I learned how to use Google AI studio

[00:02 - 00:06]
for you and here's the cliffs notes

[00:04 - 00:07]
version to save you the hours and hours

[00:06 - 00:09]
that I spent learning about it and

[00:07 - 00:11]
experimenting including actual realistic

[00:09 - 00:12]
prompts that you can get started using

[00:11 - 00:14]
to increase your productivity and to

[00:12 - 00:16]
start building your own applications

[00:14 - 00:19]
Google AI studio is honestly really

[00:16 - 00:20]
powerful tool and I kind of regret not

[00:19 - 00:23]
properly learning about it a little bit

[00:20 - 00:25]
sooner it's just because like the UI can

[00:23 - 00:27]
feel quite overwhelming because there's

[00:25 - 00:28]
just so many things that are going on

[00:27 - 00:30]
but trust me like once you actually

[00:28 - 00:32]
learn how to use these tools and

[00:30 - 00:34]
understand how it works together it

[00:32 - 00:36]
opens up a lot of things it's like a

[00:34 - 00:38]
whole new world of possibilities as per

[00:36 - 00:40]
usual I have little quizzes throughout

[00:38 - 00:42]
this video to help you actually retain

[00:40 - 00:44]
the information I'm going to be talking

[00:42 - 00:46]
about and yeah without further Ado let's

[00:44 - 00:48]
get started a portion of this video is

[00:46 - 00:49]
sponsored by

[00:48 - 00:51]
HubSpot okay so when you first go to

[00:49 - 00:52]
Google AI Studio this is what you're

[00:51 - 00:55]
going to see do you see what I mean

[00:52 - 00:57]
there's just like a lot of stuff that's

[00:55 - 00:59]
going on it can feel pretty overwhelming

[00:57 - 01:01]
but don't worry I'm going to be going

[00:59 - 01:03]
through all of these step by step and

[01:01 - 01:05]
also providing Frameworks for how to

[01:03 - 01:06]
actually use these properly but first

[01:05 - 01:08]
I'm going to give you a quick overview

[01:06 - 01:10]
so here you have your chat interface

[01:08 - 01:11]
where you can just type in your prompts

[01:10 - 01:12]
and because it's a playground

[01:11 - 01:14]
environment there's also going to be a

[01:12 - 01:15]
little bit more additional features that

[01:14 - 01:17]
you have control over which will'll go

[01:15 - 01:18]
over in a bit then you have stream real

[01:17 - 01:20]
time which is when you can interact with

[01:18 - 01:22]
Gemini using text voice video or screen

[01:20 - 01:23]
sharing especially this one I think is

[01:22 - 01:25]
really cool the screen sharing part

[01:23 - 01:27]
you're able to allow Gemini to see what

[01:25 - 01:29]
you see on screen and you're able to

[01:27 - 01:31]
interact with it and talk with it based

[01:29 - 01:32]
upon what's on your screen is there

[01:31 - 01:34]
anything you would like to know about it

[01:32 - 01:36]
I want you to tell me what is happening

[01:34 - 01:38]
on screen okay the video shows a

[01:36 - 01:41]
football match between Arsenal in West

[01:38 - 01:43]
Ham the score is 0 to zero starter apps

[01:41 - 01:44]
is a great place to start where you can

[01:43 - 01:47]
see the kinds of applications that you

[01:44 - 01:49]
can prototype and build using Google AI

[01:47 - 01:51]
studio and fine-tuning a model you can

[01:49 - 01:53]
actually fine-tune on Google AI Studio

[01:51 - 01:54]
directly and finally there's a library

[01:53 - 01:56]
where shows the history of the prompts

[01:54 - 01:58]
that you have and a prompt gallery that

[01:56 - 02:00]
gives you some inso for the kinds of

[01:58 - 02:01]
prompts that you can try out Google

[02:00 - 02:03]
studio is also free to use unless you're

[02:01 - 02:05]
building like really large scale

[02:03 - 02:07]
applications so the most natural thing

[02:05 - 02:09]
that you probably want to do is just to

[02:07 - 02:10]
start typing something in as a general

[02:09 - 02:12]
prompt which is fine you're directly

[02:10 - 02:14]
telling to AI to do something very

[02:12 - 02:16]
specific for you right now but I

[02:14 - 02:18]
actually want to spend some time talking

[02:16 - 02:19]
about the system instructions here or a

[02:18 - 02:21]
system prompt because I think it's

[02:19 - 02:23]
something that is really slept on is

[02:21 - 02:25]
really underrated a system prompt is

[02:23 - 02:27]
more like setting an instruction guide

[02:25 - 02:29]
for all of the interactions for that

[02:27 - 02:31]
specific AI you can very specifically

[02:29 - 02:33]
Define the a I's personality

[02:31 - 02:34]
capabilities and limitations making your

[02:33 - 02:36]
results just much better the way that

[02:34 - 02:38]
you define a general prompt is also

[02:36 - 02:39]
slightly different from a system prompt

[02:38 - 02:42]
so to explain this let me first just

[02:39 - 02:43]
start with a tiny little crash course on

[02:42 - 02:44]
prompt Engineering in general the

[02:43 - 02:47]
frameware that I like to use I call it

[02:44 - 02:48]
the tiny crabs right enormous iguanas

[02:47 - 02:52]
framework it's a pneumonic that stands

[02:48 - 02:54]
for task context resources evaluate and

[02:52 - 02:56]
iterate and I promise you if you can

[02:54 - 02:57]
remember just this one pneumonic and

[02:56 - 02:59]
what it stands for you'll be better at

[02:57 - 03:01]
just prompt engineering than like 90% of

[02:59 - 03:04]
the population the task is specifying

[03:01 - 03:07]
what you want the AI to do the context

[03:04 - 03:09]
is additional information and directions

[03:07 - 03:10]
that you can provide to AI to have a

[03:09 - 03:13]
better understanding of your task

[03:10 - 03:15]
resources are examples or any additional

[03:13 - 03:16]
information that you can provide the AI

[03:15 - 03:18]
with that it doesn't already know then

[03:16 - 03:21]
after you run the prompt evaluate is to

[03:18 - 03:23]
see the results and iterate is to see

[03:21 - 03:24]
what you can do to improve it let me

[03:23 - 03:27]
actually show you an example of this

[03:24 - 03:29]
framework so the task is that you want a

[03:27 - 03:30]
marketing campaign for your new nail art

[03:29 - 03:33]
collection it's also important here that

[03:30 - 03:35]
you specify that it should be an IG post

[03:33 - 03:36]
caption which is the output context is

[03:35 - 03:38]
just any additional information that you

[03:36 - 03:41]
can give to the AI I've attached a

[03:38 - 03:41]
picture of the nail art

[03:41 - 03:47]
collection I've also attached some inspo

[03:44 - 03:51]
IG post that I

[03:47 - 03:52]
like here's the inspo the inspo IG post

[03:51 - 03:54]
that you attach is going to be the

[03:52 - 03:56]
resources where you're providing to AI

[03:54 - 03:58]
with any examples in this case it's a

[03:56 - 04:01]
few screenshots of IG post but it could

[03:58 - 04:02]
also be like different PDFs that you're

[04:01 - 04:04]
wanting to create a report or something

[04:02 - 04:06]
like that just anything that the AI

[04:04 - 04:07]
doesn't already know and you're

[04:06 - 04:09]
providing it additional information

[04:07 - 04:12]
let's actually run

[04:09 - 04:14]
it and it gives us some options in the

[04:12 - 04:16]
style of the examples that we provided

[04:14 - 04:18]
next is to evaluate and you might be

[04:16 - 04:21]
like okay like this is nice but I want

[04:18 - 04:23]
it to feel more personal so we then move

[04:21 - 04:26]
on to the final part of the framework

[04:23 - 04:31]
which is to iterate you might type I

[04:26 - 04:36]
want the post captions to feel a little

[04:31 - 04:36]
bit more personal like a

[04:36 - 04:41]
story and there you go remember those

[04:39 - 04:43]
Endless Summer Nights catching fireflies

[04:41 - 04:45]
and dreaming under the stars I poured

[04:43 - 04:47]
that feeling into our new nail art

[04:45 - 04:50]
collection these Glitters are like

[04:47 - 04:52]
bottled Starlight etc etc etc I'm like

[04:50 - 04:54]
okay after this iteration I quite like

[04:52 - 04:56]
it now okay so that is a general good

[04:54 - 04:57]
prompt engineering framework guideline

[04:56 - 04:59]
but let's actually go back to the system

[04:57 - 05:01]
prompt the framework for crafting a

[04:59 - 05:03]
system prompt is not actually different

[05:01 - 05:04]
but there is a little bit more emphasis

[05:03 - 05:06]
placed on different parts of the

[05:04 - 05:08]
framework specifically you want to put

[05:06 - 05:11]
more emphasis on the task and the

[05:08 - 05:12]
context for the task is not as direct as

[05:11 - 05:14]
just saying exactly what you want it to

[05:12 - 05:17]
do you want to think about it more as

[05:14 - 05:18]
the ai's overall role and interaction

[05:17 - 05:20]
style you want to consider the tone that

[05:18 - 05:22]
you want the AI to communicate with do

[05:20 - 05:24]
you want it to be formal informal

[05:22 - 05:26]
humorous professional the length of his

[05:24 - 05:28]
responses should it be brief should it

[05:26 - 05:31]
be really detailed the format of the

[05:28 - 05:33]
output should it be a list a paragraph

[05:31 - 05:35]
code Pros Json formats you also want to

[05:33 - 05:37]
define a Persona which is explicitly

[05:35 - 05:39]
stating in ai's identity and

[05:37 - 05:40]
characteristics this is something that

[05:39 - 05:42]
you can also include in your general

[05:40 - 05:44]
prompts but a lot of times you can get

[05:42 - 05:45]
away with not doing that just because

[05:44 - 05:48]
the task that you're asking it to do is

[05:45 - 05:50]
so specific but for a system prompt you

[05:48 - 05:51]
definitely want to include a Persona

[05:50 - 05:53]
some examples of personas would be like

[05:51 - 05:54]
you're a helpful and friendly coding

[05:53 - 05:56]
assistant you might want to include some

[05:54 - 05:58]
expertise like you're an expert

[05:56 - 05:59]
specifically in python or JavaScript or

[05:58 - 06:02]
you might want to put some restrictions

[05:59 - 06:04]
like say you're a medical expert but you

[06:02 - 06:06]
are not authorized to provide medical

[06:04 - 06:07]
advice now for the context this is the

[06:06 - 06:10]
opportunity for you to provide even more

[06:07 - 06:12]
additional information and instructions

[06:10 - 06:14]
to the AI you can specify like domain

[06:12 - 06:16]
expertise like you have access to a

[06:14 - 06:18]
database of academic papers in the field

[06:16 - 06:20]
of astrophysics give more details about

[06:18 - 06:21]
what is allowed or not allowed to do

[06:20 - 06:23]
like you're allowed to access external

[06:21 - 06:25]
websites to retrieve information but

[06:23 - 06:27]
you're not allowed to generate any

[06:25 - 06:29]
responses that has anything to do with

[06:27 - 06:32]
being sexually suggestive or

[06:29 - 06:33]
exploitative for example the rest of the

[06:32 - 06:35]
framework Remains the Same so let me

[06:33 - 06:37]
actually give you an example of what a

[06:35 - 06:38]
good system prompt will look like say

[06:37 - 06:41]
you're interested in creating AI that is

[06:38 - 06:42]
specific for providing recipes here is

[06:41 - 06:45]
the system prompt you're a helpful

[06:42 - 06:47]
cooking assistant specializing in simple

[06:45 - 06:49]
one pot recipes so that's the Persona

[06:47 - 06:51]
your task is to analyze photos of

[06:49 - 06:54]
ingredients and suggest recipes based on

[06:51 - 06:56]
them the task provide recipes in a clear

[06:54 - 06:58]
step-by-step format include approximate

[06:56 - 07:00]
cooking times and how many people the

[06:58 - 07:02]
meal should serve this is specifying

[07:00 - 07:03]
with more detail about the output always

[07:02 - 07:05]
stick to recipe suggestions and cooking

[07:03 - 07:07]
advice if asked about anything unrelated

[07:05 - 07:08]
to cooking or nutrition politely

[07:07 - 07:10]
redirect the conversation back to their

[07:08 - 07:13]
recipe ideas and this is additional

[07:10 - 07:15]
context so let's set the system prompt

[07:13 - 07:17]
and I'm actually going to put a picture

[07:15 - 07:18]
this is an actual picture of what is

[07:17 - 07:20]
currently in my fridge the general

[07:18 - 07:22]
prompt we're going to write is analyze

[07:20 - 07:23]
the photo and list the main ingredients

[07:22 - 07:26]
that you see then suggest the meal

[07:23 - 07:28]
preferably as a stew or a soup um not

[07:26 - 07:31]
pictured but I also have kimchi Japanese

[07:28 - 07:31]
Curry cubes and rice

[07:31 - 07:37]
okay so it says that what I have here is

[07:34 - 07:39]
tofu eggs lemon soy sauce and miso that

[07:37 - 07:42]
is correct um and it says I can make a

[07:39 - 07:45]
kimchi tofu stew with eggs kimchi gig

[07:42 - 07:47]
inspired great wonderful okay time for

[07:45 - 07:49]
our first quiz please answer the

[07:47 - 07:51]
question displayed on screen and put it

[07:49 - 07:54]
in the comments I really hope that by

[07:51 - 07:56]
now you can see how important the skill

[07:54 - 07:58]
of prompt engineering is it can be the

[07:56 - 07:59]
difference between getting the results

[07:58 - 08:01]
that you want and just getting like like

[07:59 - 08:03]
some generic response hands down prompt

[08:01 - 08:04]
engineering is the highest return on

[08:03 - 08:07]
investment skill that you can learn in

[08:04 - 08:09]
2025 so if you are looking to improve

[08:07 - 08:10]
your prompt engineering skills I highly

[08:09 - 08:12]
recommend that you check out this free

[08:10 - 08:14]
prompt engineering quick start guide

[08:12 - 08:16]
that I made with HubSpot it includes a

[08:14 - 08:18]
step-by-step guide to creating great AI

[08:16 - 08:20]
prompts and also tips to get better

[08:18 - 08:22]
results my favorite part is that there's

[08:20 - 08:24]
a flow of bad to good to Great prompts

[08:22 - 08:26]
that exactly shows you how you can

[08:24 - 08:27]
improve a prompt if you're able to get

[08:26 - 08:29]
yourself to start thinking in this way

[08:27 - 08:31]
you will become much better at prompting

[08:29 - 08:33]
and also just be much more productive at

[08:31 - 08:35]
everything that you do so do check it

[08:33 - 08:37]
out at this link over here also linked

[08:35 - 08:39]
in description thank you so much hpot

[08:37 - 08:40]
for creating this free resource with me

[08:39 - 08:43]
and for sponsoring this portion of the

[08:40 - 08:44]
video now back to the video okay so now

[08:43 - 08:46]
I actually want to talk about all the

[08:44 - 08:48]
little features that you see over here

[08:46 - 08:50]
that are actually really powerful the

[08:48 - 08:51]
first thing you can do is that you see

[08:50 - 08:52]
how in the model you can switch to

[08:51 - 08:55]
models that are available we're

[08:52 - 08:57]
currently using Gemini 2.0 flash but we

[08:55 - 08:59]
can actually click compare and be able

[08:57 - 09:03]
to try out another one and compar to

[08:59 - 09:05]
results like Gemini 2.0 pro

[09:03 - 09:08]
experimental February 5th let's do that

[09:05 - 09:11]
one okay so I'm just going to do the

[09:08 - 09:15]
same prompt click run and we see that um

[09:11 - 09:18]
flash is faster which is expected and

[09:15 - 09:20]
Gemini 2.0 pro is a little bit slower in

[09:18 - 09:23]
its response but it is more detailed

[09:20 - 09:24]
like providing tips and notes as well so

[09:23 - 09:26]
I don't know if this is a fluke but I

[09:24 - 09:29]
actually identify the tofu is firm or

[09:26 - 09:32]
press tofu while

[09:29 - 09:34]
here it was not specified what kind of

[09:32 - 09:36]
tofu it was and it actually is from tofu

[09:34 - 09:37]
also I want to specify that because I'm

[09:36 - 09:39]
in Hong Kong the language that's being

[09:37 - 09:41]
written actually I think some of it is

[09:39 - 09:45]
Japanese but the other parts of it is in

[09:41 - 09:47]
Chinese so it does work for things and

[09:45 - 09:49]
labels that are not in English as well

[09:47 - 09:51]
let's just stick to Gemini 2.0 flash

[09:49 - 09:52]
because it's faster and I want to talk

[09:51 - 09:54]
here about DET token so one of the

[09:52 - 09:56]
biggest highlights of the Gemini models

[09:54 - 09:58]
is that it has a huge context window at

[09:56 - 10:00]
over a million and just to give you an

[09:58 - 10:02]
understanding of how big that actually

[10:00 - 10:04]
is this means that you can provide it

[10:02 - 10:06]
with like five or six full length books

[10:04 - 10:07]
people have tried doing that and and

[10:06 - 10:09]
what's really cool is that it's also

[10:07 - 10:11]
able to analyze video because video data

[10:09 - 10:13]
is generally a lot larger and I have

[10:11 - 10:16]
managed to put in videos up to like four

[10:13 - 10:17]
to 5 minutes it's also really really

[10:16 - 10:18]
good like better than any model I've

[10:17 - 10:20]
seen but I'm getting ahead of myself

[10:18 - 10:22]
I'll show you guys in a bit let's first

[10:20 - 10:24]
get through the rest of these

[10:22 - 10:25]
temperature is the amount of creativity

[10:24 - 10:27]
that you're going to allow the model to

[10:25 - 10:29]
have if you have higher temperatures

[10:27 - 10:31]
it's going to be more creative and it's

[10:29 - 10:32]
up to to and if you have lower

[10:31 - 10:34]
temperatures it's going to be less

[10:32 - 10:37]
creative structured output is when you

[10:34 - 10:38]
want more control over what the result

[10:37 - 10:40]
is going to look like and you want it to

[10:38 - 10:42]
be reproducible let me give you an

[10:40 - 10:44]
example of when having a structured

[10:42 - 10:47]
output would be helpful so say you're a

[10:44 - 10:49]
product marketer and you want to have ai

[10:47 - 10:51]
help you a little bit here's your system

[10:49 - 10:52]
prompt you're a product marketer

[10:51 - 10:54]
targeting a jenzy audience create

[10:52 - 10:56]
exciting a fresh advertising copy for

[10:54 - 10:59]
products keep copy under a few sentences

[10:56 - 11:01]
long and use jenzy lingo so if you were

[10:59 - 11:03]
just to type something here like say

[11:01 - 11:06]
create copy for a pair of men's black

[11:03 - 11:08]
running shoes and you run it it would

[11:06 - 11:10]
you know come up with like this kind of

[11:08 - 11:13]
thing situation but if you turn on

[11:10 - 11:15]
structured output for example um and you

[11:13 - 11:16]
can actually come here and edit what it

[11:15 - 11:18]
is that you want it to look like and the

[11:16 - 11:20]
reason why you want to do this is maybe

[11:18 - 11:21]
you want the output to be a very

[11:20 - 11:24]
specific format because you want to be

[11:21 - 11:25]
able to plug this into a database or to

[11:24 - 11:27]
an application that you're making so

[11:25 - 11:30]
this is especially helpful if you're a

[11:27 - 11:32]
developer um because you can get the

[11:30 - 11:34]
data to look a certain way to make sure

[11:32 - 11:36]
that your app is consistent so a certain

[11:34 - 11:37]
for example here the code editor looks

[11:36 - 11:39]
like this but we can also use the visual

[11:37 - 11:42]
editor and you can add a property like

[11:39 - 11:45]
here we might want to say um I don't

[11:42 - 11:47]
know product name and we want to make

[11:45 - 11:49]
this required and then you can also say

[11:47 - 11:51]
the product copy right and it's also

[11:49 - 11:53]
going to make this required and you can

[11:51 - 11:55]
of course change this into whatever it

[11:53 - 12:01]
is that you want uh we're going to keep

[11:55 - 12:01]
it as string for both and if you do that

[12:01 - 12:05]
you would get like this like a Json

[12:03 - 12:08]
format and you're able to copy that to a

[12:05 - 12:10]
clipboard or to download it as well and

[12:08 - 12:12]
because it's an a Json format you can

[12:10 - 12:14]
actually get the code for it too yeah

[12:12 - 12:16]
you'll able to take this and then put it

[12:14 - 12:19]
into your application this is so helpful

[12:16 - 12:21]
and really really powerful so I'm not

[12:19 - 12:23]
going to go and actually like make an

[12:21 - 12:24]
application right now to like show you

[12:23 - 12:26]
everything cuz this video is already

[12:24 - 12:27]
probably going to be really long but let

[12:26 - 12:28]
me know in the comments if you're

[12:27 - 12:30]
actually interested in me showing you

[12:28 - 12:33]
how to build like a full AI application

[12:30 - 12:34]
hello it is Tina from the future here I

[12:33 - 12:36]
just want to let you know that if you're

[12:34 - 12:38]
interested into diving deeper into

[12:36 - 12:40]
different AI topics cuz I can't fit

[12:38 - 12:42]
everything into just a single video I

[12:40 - 12:43]
also do AI workshops that are completely

[12:42 - 12:44]
free so if you're interested you can

[12:43 - 12:46]
sign up at this link over here also

[12:44 - 12:48]
linked in description okay back to the

[12:46 - 12:49]
video anyways in the meantime let me go

[12:48 - 12:51]
through the other tools that are

[12:49 - 12:52]
available here so code execution is

[12:51 - 12:54]
pretty straightforward you're basically

[12:52 - 12:56]
allowing the AI to have the ability of

[12:54 - 12:57]
executing codes whether that be a

[12:56 - 13:00]
calculation whether that be if you're

[12:57 - 13:02]
wanted to create an application for you

[13:00 - 13:04]
um it can go and execute code to in

[13:02 - 13:06]
order to do it so a really simple

[13:04 - 13:07]
example would be something like just

[13:06 - 13:09]
calculate how much money I would have

[13:07 - 13:13]
earned if I put $1,000 with a compound

[13:09 - 13:17]
annual interest rate of 9% for the past

[13:13 - 13:17]
two years you can put in code

[13:17 - 13:21]
execution and it would be able to do

[13:19 - 13:22]
this calculation for you there you go

[13:21 - 13:25]
next up is function calling and this can

[13:22 - 13:28]
be really really powerful it allows you

[13:25 - 13:30]
to equip your AI with custom functions

[13:28 - 13:32]
or tools so that that it's able to

[13:30 - 13:34]
either pull data or execute certain

[13:32 - 13:36]
things a simple example here is that you

[13:34 - 13:38]
can have something called get weather

[13:36 - 13:40]
and that can connect to an external API

[13:38 - 13:42]
so it's able to directly pull

[13:40 - 13:45]
information about a specific weather

[13:42 - 13:47]
forecast directly from the API another

[13:45 - 13:50]
example would be if you want your AI to

[13:47 - 13:51]
be able to book restaurants for you you

[13:50 - 13:53]
might want to give it access to an API

[13:51 - 13:56]
like Open Table where it can be able to

[13:53 - 13:58]
call this function and actually do the

[13:56 - 14:00]
reservation for you another example if

[13:58 - 14:02]
you have a function that gives it access

[14:00 - 14:04]
to the Google Calendar API it would

[14:02 - 14:06]
allow the AI to be able to schedule

[14:04 - 14:07]
things into your actual Google Calendar

[14:06 - 14:08]
function calling also really starts to

[14:07 - 14:11]
shine when you're actually building AI

[14:08 - 14:12]
applications so we're doing that video I

[14:11 - 14:14]
will go into more detail about it but

[14:12 - 14:16]
moving along the last tool available is

[14:14 - 14:18]
grounding with Google search this gives

[14:16 - 14:20]
your model the ability to browse the

[14:18 - 14:22]
internet and to validate whatever it's

[14:20 - 14:24]
outputting with results from Google it's

[14:22 - 14:26]
helpful for preventing hallucinations

[14:24 - 14:28]
and also to give your model access to

[14:26 - 14:30]
information that it doesn't currently

[14:28 - 14:31]
have here is an example so this is

[14:30 - 14:34]
actually true I'm going back to San

[14:31 - 14:35]
Francisco May 15 2025 for a wedding

[14:34 - 14:37]
while I'm there what are some

[14:35 - 14:39]
interesting festivals conferences were

[14:37 - 14:40]
events that I could also drop by and

[14:39 - 14:42]
visit I'll stick around until end of May

[14:40 - 14:45]
and I don't mind traveling within the US

[14:42 - 14:47]
and Canada also write I'm interested in

[14:45 - 14:51]
events related to

[14:47 - 14:54]
education Tech and just general cultural

[14:51 - 14:55]
or music festivals then we're actually

[14:54 - 14:57]
going to turn on grounding with Google

[14:55 - 15:01]
search so it's able to have information

[14:57 - 15:01]
from Google to look up

[15:01 - 15:05]
it gave me some options over here and it

[15:03 - 15:07]
also shows what it is that it's

[15:05 - 15:08]
searching um on Google search as well

[15:07 - 15:10]
there are also some more advanced

[15:08 - 15:12]
settings like setting safety settings

[15:10 - 15:14]
depending on the kind of responses that

[15:12 - 15:16]
you want to get a stop sequence what it

[15:14 - 15:18]
is that you want to potentially get the

[15:16 - 15:20]
AI to stop if it reaches a certain

[15:18 - 15:22]
sequence the output length how long you

[15:20 - 15:24]
want it to be in terms of number of

[15:22 - 15:26]
tokens and the top ke which is another

[15:24 - 15:27]
way of controlling the randomness of the

[15:26 - 15:29]
output that is different than just

[15:27 - 15:30]
adjusting the temperature you can

[15:29 - 15:32]
definitely play around with these and it

[15:30 - 15:34]
can be helpful if you're doing like very

[15:32 - 15:36]
specific things but I would say

[15:34 - 15:38]
generally speaking there's really not

[15:36 - 15:40]
that much need to fiddle around with

[15:38 - 15:42]
these unless again you're building an

[15:40 - 15:45]
application or something like that let's

[15:42 - 15:48]
not talk about let's now

[15:45 - 15:51]
talk let's not

[15:48 - 15:53]
talk two hours later let's not talk

[15:51 - 15:55]
about video specifically video stuff

[15:53 - 15:56]
like video Generation video analysis and

[15:55 - 15:59]
things like that has been emerging for a

[15:56 - 16:01]
while now but it really is starting to

[15:59 - 16:03]
shine especially with Gemini you can see

[16:01 - 16:05]
why having such a large context window

[16:03 - 16:07]
is able to allow you to analyze quite a

[16:05 - 16:09]
lot of video content and it does it

[16:07 - 16:12]
better than what I have seen any other

[16:09 - 16:14]
model do so far here is a clip of a

[16:12 - 16:16]
football match between Arsenal and West

[16:14 - 16:19]
Ham United I don't know anything about

[16:16 - 16:21]
football but it's a clip that I found as

[16:19 - 16:22]
one of the highlights so I'm going to

[16:21 - 16:25]
take this 2-minute clip put it into

[16:22 - 16:27]
Gemini and write analyze the provided

[16:25 - 16:29]
video highlight reel for Arsenal versus

[16:27 - 16:30]
West Ham 0:1 Premier League could you

[16:29 - 16:33]
first identify the timestamps of the

[16:30 - 16:37]
goals and near misses and then whoops

[16:33 - 16:37]
and then give a detailed commentary with

[16:38 - 16:42]
timestamps oh my God I actually even got

[16:40 - 16:43]
the people's name right I don't actually

[16:42 - 16:45]
I don't know if these names are right so

[16:43 - 16:47]
it says key moment time stamps the near

[16:45 - 16:49]
misses the goal and another near Miss I

[16:47 - 16:52]
know that this is correct that is

[16:49 - 16:56]
correct 47 seconds in there's a goal

[16:52 - 17:00]
that is also correct and it was in fact

[16:56 - 17:02]
West Ham and at a minute 49

[17:00 - 17:04]
there was another near Miss I don't know

[17:02 - 17:06]
if it was actually these people that did

[17:04 - 17:08]
it but for anybody that knows football

[17:06 - 17:10]
are these the actual correct people yeah

[17:08 - 17:11]
and then it gives a detailed commentary

[17:10 - 17:15]
about what it is that is happening as

[17:11 - 17:17]
well that is freaking cool isn't it like

[17:15 - 17:19]
that is that just like blew my mind I

[17:17 - 17:22]
was able just to like analyze the video

[17:19 - 17:24]
data and that just unlocks so much

[17:22 - 17:26]
potential for all the video content that

[17:24 - 17:27]
we have available of course in addition

[17:26 - 17:30]
to video data you can also upload like

[17:27 - 17:31]
large files power points PDFs upload all

[17:30 - 17:34]
these resources as well to Google AI

[17:31 - 17:36]
studio and the model does a pretty good

[17:34 - 17:37]
job of extracting information from it

[17:36 - 17:40]
but before I move on to the next section

[17:37 - 17:41]
here is a little quiz to make sure that

[17:40 - 17:43]
you're retaining all the things and

[17:41 - 17:46]
informations that I am talking about

[17:43 - 17:46]
answer the questions in the

[17:51 - 17:54]
comments let's talk about stream real

[17:53 - 17:56]
time and this allows you to interact

[17:54 - 17:58]
with Gemini using text voice video or

[17:56 - 17:59]
screen sharing so I'm sure that many of

[17:58 - 18:01]
you guys have have tried out the voice

[17:59 - 18:03]
functionalities but using Google AI

[18:01 - 18:04]
Studio you can also show Gemini using

[18:03 - 18:07]
your webcam and interact with it

[18:04 - 18:09]
directly and you can also share your

[18:07 - 18:11]
screen so it's able to have context

[18:09 - 18:13]
about what is happening in your screen

[18:11 - 18:14]
and give you real-time commentary

[18:13 - 18:16]
directing you to things giving you

[18:14 - 18:17]
instructions or just interacting with

[18:16 - 18:19]
whatever it is that you're interacting

[18:17 - 18:24]
with okay so we're going to do share

[18:19 - 18:26]
your screen Chrome tab and this one

[18:24 - 18:27]
specifically okay I see you're talking

[18:26 - 18:29]
about a specific Chrome tab is there

[18:27 - 18:32]
anything you would like to know about it

[18:29 - 18:33]
what is happening in this clip right now

[18:32 - 18:35]
okay in the video the players are moving

[18:33 - 18:37]
around the field and a player in black

[18:35 - 18:39]
is on the ground having just been

[18:37 - 18:40]
tackled it looks like the player in red

[18:39 - 18:43]
and white has gained possession of the

[18:40 - 18:46]
ball also the score is now Arsenal zero

[18:43 - 18:48]
West Ham 1 so there is a little bit of a

[18:46 - 18:50]
lag but just the fact that it's able to

[18:48 - 18:52]
watch that video with you and just

[18:50 - 18:55]
comment on what's Happening like that

[18:52 - 18:57]
was so mindblowing to me you can

[18:55 - 18:59]
probably see that this is so powerful as

[18:57 - 19:02]
having like a very personalized

[18:59 - 19:04]
Specialist or personalized tutor just

[19:02 - 19:05]
comment or teach you whatever it is and

[19:04 - 19:07]
just constantly help you out and

[19:05 - 19:08]
whatever it is that you're doing so

[19:07 - 19:10]
another example here is I'm going to

[19:08 - 19:12]
share a screen okay I see that you are

[19:10 - 19:15]
sharing your screen is there anything

[19:12 - 19:16]
you would like me to do with it yes so

[19:15 - 19:18]
currently I have this picture on

[19:16 - 19:20]
Photoshop and I want to remove the

[19:18 - 19:22]
turtle at this very on this very back of

[19:20 - 19:24]
the image how do I do that okay to

[19:22 - 19:26]
remove the turtle in the back you could

[19:24 - 19:28]
use the lasso tool to select it then use

[19:26 - 19:29]
the content aware fill option to fill in

[19:28 - 19:30]
the space

[19:29 - 19:33]
would you like me to go into more detail

[19:30 - 19:36]
about this yeah can you instruct me step

[19:33 - 19:38]
by step on where to click and what to do

[19:36 - 19:39]
okay first select the lasso tool from

[19:38 - 19:41]
the toolbar on the left side of the

[19:39 - 19:43]
screen let me let me do a step by step

[19:41 - 19:45]
hold on so the lasso tool so you want me

[19:43 - 19:47]
to draw a selection of the turtle here

[19:45 - 19:50]
yes that is correct you will want to use

[19:47 - 19:52]
the lasso tool to draw a selection

[19:50 - 19:53]
around the turtle in the very back okay

[19:52 - 19:55]
I did that now what now that you've made

[19:53 - 19:57]
a selection with the lasso tool go to

[19:55 - 19:59]
the edit menu at the top and then select

[19:57 - 20:01]
content aware fill

[19:59 - 20:03]
this will remove the turtle and try to

[20:01 - 20:07]
fill the area with what's around it I

[20:03 - 20:09]
don't see content aware fill okay I see

[20:07 - 20:11]
my apologies oh no I see it here it's

[20:09 - 20:14]
grayed out over here okay it seems the

[20:11 - 20:15]
content aware fill option is grayed out

[20:14 - 20:17]
this means that you likely have an

[20:15 - 20:19]
object layer selected could you please

[20:17 - 20:22]
select the image layer and try again I

[20:19 - 20:26]
do have the image layer

[20:22 - 20:26]
selected then F and then the cont

[20:27 - 20:32]
cont you to right and and go edit then

[20:29 - 20:34]
fill and cont contare and press okay oh

[20:32 - 20:36]
okay so now I can see it so I now I do

[20:34 - 20:39]
content aware fill yes now you can use

[20:36 - 20:41]
content aware fill oh nice okay cool and

[20:39 - 20:44]
then I can just click okay nice yes you

[20:41 - 20:47]
can click okay to apply the content to

[20:44 - 20:48]
Weare fill yeah there you go I played

[20:47 - 20:50]
around quite a lot with streaming old

[20:48 - 20:53]
time and it is honestly like so

[20:50 - 20:54]
incredible like it blows my mind that

[20:53 - 20:56]
people don't know about this and the

[20:54 - 20:58]
fact that this is free like all the use

[20:56 - 20:59]
cases that you can think of whenever

[20:58 - 21:01]
ever it is that you want someone to just

[20:59 - 21:03]
teach you something directly whenever it

[21:01 - 21:04]
is that you just wish someone would just

[21:03 - 21:06]
like show you how to do something as

[21:04 - 21:08]
opposed to watching like 50 tutorial

[21:06 - 21:09]
videos about something this this can do

[21:08 - 21:11]
it for you when you're coding you know

[21:09 - 21:13]
you don't know how to do something you

[21:11 - 21:16]
don't know how to whatever it is you can

[21:13 - 21:17]
use stream real time to do that um

[21:16 - 21:18]
whenever you're looking at some Excel

[21:17 - 21:21]
file don't know what the function is

[21:18 - 21:23]
that works as well even using like the

[21:21 - 21:25]
um webcam style like you're drawing

[21:23 - 21:26]
something you're asking it to critique

[21:25 - 21:28]
what it is that you're drawing it's just

[21:26 - 21:29]
so many different use cases well I'm

[21:28 - 21:31]
curious to know what kind of use cases

[21:29 - 21:34]
that you've tried out where you can

[21:31 - 21:37]
suddenly imagine this being able to help

[21:34 - 21:37]
you with let me know in the

[21:47 - 21:50]
comments the next tab is some starter

[21:49 - 21:52]
apps so this is where Google provides

[21:50 - 21:54]
some examples of some of the apps that

[21:52 - 21:57]
you can prototype and build out using

[21:54 - 21:59]
Gemini uh and using Google AI studio so

[21:57 - 22:01]
I just want to show you like for example

[21:59 - 22:02]
map Explorer which is really really cool

[22:01 - 22:05]
and this is something that you can get

[22:02 - 22:07]
the code for on GitHub as well so for

[22:05 - 22:09]
example you can say take me somewhere

[22:07 - 22:11]
ancient and it will tell you that you

[22:09 - 22:14]
can go somewhere like

[22:11 - 22:16]
go I don't know how to pronounce in

[22:14 - 22:18]
Turkey this archaeological site is home

[22:16 - 22:20]
to the oldest known megaliths in the

[22:18 - 22:22]
world and it gives you the information

[22:20 - 22:24]
here this is connected to the Google

[22:22 - 22:28]
Maps API and you can also type something

[22:24 - 22:31]
like I want to go somewhere close close

[22:28 - 22:36]
through Hong Kong that has a lot of

[22:31 - 22:38]
hiking trails and is relatively remote

[22:36 - 22:41]
and here it is Crooked Islands offers

[22:38 - 22:43]
pristine beaches Lush forest and

[22:41 - 22:47]
challenging trails and you can explore

[22:43 - 22:50]
this area zoom into things as

[22:47 - 22:51]
well pretty cool right yeah definitely

[22:50 - 22:53]
play around with some of these starter

[22:51 - 22:54]
apps and just feel very inspired by all

[22:53 - 22:57]
the things that you can build okay time

[22:54 - 23:01]
for another quiz please answer these

[22:57 - 23:01]
questions and comment in the

[23:05 - 23:09]
comments moving on now to the final

[23:07 - 23:12]
really cool feature from Google AI

[23:09 - 23:14]
Studio which is tune a model you can f

[23:12 - 23:16]
tune a model directly within Google AI

[23:14 - 23:18]
studio and you don't even need to know

[23:16 - 23:19]
how to code so why would you want to do

[23:18 - 23:21]
this the reason why you might want to

[23:19 - 23:23]
find tuna model is if you want to

[23:21 - 23:25]
increase the performance of the model

[23:23 - 23:27]
for a very specific task the way that

[23:25 - 23:29]
fine-tuning works is that you provide

[23:27 - 23:32]
the model with a training data set that

[23:29 - 23:33]
contains many examples of a task this is

[23:32 - 23:35]
especially useful if you have a very

[23:33 - 23:37]
Niche task and fine tuning can allow to

[23:35 - 23:40]
have significant improvements in the

[23:37 - 23:42]
results it's recommended that you have

[23:40 - 23:44]
100 to 500 examples and you can create a

[23:42 - 23:47]
structured prompt so the data that you

[23:44 - 23:49]
want to provide should be in two columns

[23:47 - 23:51]
the first one is the input which is the

[23:49 - 23:53]
user's input and the output which is

[23:51 - 23:54]
what the model's response is so one way

[23:53 - 23:56]
of doing this is that you can just

[23:54 - 23:59]
directly ADD test examples into the UI

[23:56 - 24:01]
itself or you can import a CSV they also

[23:59 - 24:03]
provide some samples of what this can

[24:01 - 24:04]
look like so we can try out one of the

[24:03 - 24:06]
samples here so say we're going to try

[24:04 - 24:08]
out the news headline so this is what

[24:06 - 24:10]
the input and output looks like so the

[24:08 - 24:11]
input here is that you have like a huge

[24:10 - 24:13]
chunk of things blah blah blah like all

[24:11 - 24:15]
this information that is here and the

[24:13 - 24:18]
output you wanted to say just mobile

[24:15 - 24:20]
games come of AG you can call this model

[24:18 - 24:22]
whatever you want so we can call it news

[24:20 - 24:24]
model and the model that we're going to

[24:22 - 24:27]
choose here is the 1.5 Flash and then we

[24:24 - 24:30]
can just click tune so in your library

[24:27 - 24:32]
over here it is is fine-tuning and look

[24:30 - 24:34]
yay it looks like that you can use your

[24:32 - 24:37]
tune model now so you can use it in chat

[24:34 - 24:39]
copy paste some new segment and let's

[24:37 - 24:41]
run it warning receipts are fast future

[24:39 - 24:43]
contracts which is in the style that the

[24:41 - 24:45]
training data set is on some other

[24:43 - 24:47]
useful use cases for when you would want

[24:45 - 24:48]
to find tuna model is say for example if

[24:47 - 24:50]
you want to have some specialized

[24:48 - 24:52]
ranking system like maybe you have a

[24:50 - 24:54]
bunch of comments and you want to rank

[24:52 - 24:56]
it from like 1 to five but in a very

[24:54 - 24:58]
specific criteria sort of way that can

[24:56 - 25:00]
be useful by providing examples and fine

[24:58 - 25:03]
tuning maybe you want to translate

[25:00 - 25:05]
medical note shorthands or go through a

[25:03 - 25:08]
lot of documents like legal documents

[25:05 - 25:10]
and extract very specific components

[25:08 - 25:11]
from each of these documents it may also

[25:10 - 25:13]
be useful in customer support if you're

[25:11 - 25:14]
selling like a very specific type of

[25:13 - 25:16]
product and the way that you want to

[25:14 - 25:18]
interact with a customer is very very

[25:16 - 25:20]
specific that can also be useful and

[25:18 - 25:22]
actually after you find tun a model you

[25:20 - 25:24]
can also easily incorporate that into an

[25:22 - 25:26]
app like say if you want to build um a

[25:24 - 25:28]
customer support agent out of it from

[25:26 - 25:30]
your fine-tuned model you can just

[25:28 - 25:33]
directly add API access where you can

[25:30 - 25:34]
just go here and get your API key and

[25:33 - 25:36]
have access to the model

[25:34 - 25:38]
programmatically again if you want me to

[25:36 - 25:40]
do a video in which I'll show you how to

[25:38 - 25:42]
build these applications let me know in

[25:40 - 25:43]
the comments if you let me know in the

[25:42 - 25:47]
comments then I will know that there is

[25:43 - 25:47]
interest and I will feel motivated to do

[25:55 - 26:02]
it all right I think that was a pretty

[25:58 - 26:04]
comprehensive overview tutorial slash I

[26:02 - 26:05]
don't know run through of Google AI

[26:04 - 26:08]
studio and I really hope that you're

[26:05 - 26:09]
able to see how much potential this tool

[26:08 - 26:11]
has and you feel inspired to try it out

[26:09 - 26:13]
yourself as well before I end this video

[26:11 - 26:15]
I'm now going to put on screen the final

[26:13 - 26:17]
little quiz if you were able to answer

[26:15 - 26:20]
all of these questions from all these

[26:17 - 26:23]
quizzes then congratulations you are now

[26:20 - 26:25]
quite educated on Google AI Studio thank

[26:23 - 26:26]
you all so much for watching and I will

[26:25 - 26:29]
see you guys in the next video or live

Improve your AI skills with the FREE Prompting QuickStart Guide I made in collaboration with Hubspot: https://clickhubspot.com/yj4t

> **@LavelNuwo** (👍 0): 17:45 
1. What does temperature control?
2. When would you want to use structured output?
3. When would you want to use function calling?

> **@LavelNuwo** (👍 0): ❤

> **@RomonaFoster** (👍 1): This one went way over my head. I need Tina 101. 😃 What's a good place to start on your channel for beginners?

> **@germanher7528** (👍 0): Should set your camera focus to manual so it keeps focused at a distance, obviously need a camera that has manual options

> **@AbstractABC** (👍 0): Just to let you know, the download of the prompt guide did not work. Great video though. Thanks so much.

### 2. @KISHORPARMAR-l1u (👍 56)
I am 67 years of age,and i still found this video very interesting and informative. I have learnt so much. Thank you for sharing.

> **@doingart8170** (👍 0): She's amazing and so are you!

### 3. @ChristieWinstead (👍 40)
1) Temperature control the level of creativity of the response.
2) Structured output is used when you need the response to have a specific format to use for another application
3) Function calling allows the AI to get information from other applications

### 4. @MarcoLandin (👍 6)
YES to you making a video showing us how to build applications!  Thank you!  I'm just starting out in the AI space & I'm learning so much thanks to you!

Patiently waiting for Tina's next video on building AI Application. Thank you for sharing with us!!

### 7. @markcaudill6641 (👍 0)
Been watching videos on AI for a few days and glad I came across your channel. You do a great job of keeping it simple enough for for an old man to understand. Just want to say thanks for making learning fun for old people like me.

### 8. @danielmassa5861 (👍 1)
Hey Tina! 👋 Amazing video as always! I'd be super interested in a tutorial on model fine-tuning - especially how to approach it practically without going broke 😅

You always explain complex topics so clearly and address the real problems we all face. A step-by-step guide would be incredible:
- Which tools/frameworks are realistic for regular people?
- How much compute do you actually need?
- Common pitfalls to avoid?
- Maybe a hands-on example with a smaller model?

Would also love to hear about your experiences - what mistakes did you make early on?

Keep up the amazing work! Your videos have helped me so many times 🙌

### 9. @Djowy13 (👍 9)
So a 1000% I wanna see an application built! If you explain in the same way I'll definitely grasp it so fast I love the way you explain so much 💯💯

### 10. @meshackomondi434 (👍 13)
I stumbled on your channel, and clicking play was one of the best things I've done this year.

> **@TommyVidzeo** (👍 1): me too

### 11. @jorgevonstrange (👍 6)
Q1 (7:45)
1. Tiny Crabs Ride Enormous Iguanas stands for Task, Context, Resources, Evaluate and Iterate. 
2. Both Task and Context

Q2 (17:43)
1. Controls the creativity of the model in use: hotter means more creativity.
2. Structured output is necessary when you need to used for a specific use, for an application that requires .JSON files.
3. To add tools and other custom functions for a better data collection ou run scripts.

Q3 (22:55)
1. Basically anything. If the system instructions has a Tutor persona, with you ask properly you can learn from programming to cooking with a little background.
2. I had a lot of ideias but without time to think how to apply them. Nevertheless, prompt engineering it's a facinating topic itself.

Q4 (26:13)
1. Because for a specific task, it's more likely get better results with a model trained for the task specified.

Tina, your work and channel are amazing!!

### 12. @asperjasp (👍 6)
Your skills personality put into your videos are highly remarkable. Well done, you are a great an kind person in this Niche.

### 13. @rwilson5157 (👍 4)
25:59 interested in having you show some app builds- thanks for your efforts!

### 14. @edwarddolejsi1489 (👍 3)
Tina, you are an amazing instructor! At 80, it becomes a bit more challenging to grasp everything at the speed of a young brain, but you make it easy(er). I don’t know what projects I will use this exciting tool on, but I am sure I will find something interesting to do. Thanks.

### 15. @foysalmunir (👍 2)

Q2

1. Temperature controls room for creativity. 
2. Structured output is useful when the outputs are needed in a certain format to allow compatibility.
3. Function calling is used to build applications with external API's to perform certain actions

### 16. @jeromesmith2417 (👍 1)
1.creativity
2. Honing or individualising the format for specific applicaitions
3. Allows AI to get info externally

### 17. @sahitidwivedula7237 (👍 2)
100% wanna see your video on how to build apps, please make that video asap, looking forward to it

### 18. @Ranjanwatson (👍 4)
Hey, Tina thanks a ton for making the video. You are so easy to understand as you present technical concepts with striking clarity. I am in Dallas, Texas and hope to see you when you
plan on visiting here in May. 
Meanwhile let me watch your video a few more times to grasp and focus on what I want to specialize.
Again, thank you for posting the videos. I find them extremely helpful.
