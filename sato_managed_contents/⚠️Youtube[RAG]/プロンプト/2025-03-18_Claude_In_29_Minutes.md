## Â≠óÂπï

[00:00 - 00:03]
I learned everything about anthropics

[00:01 - 00:04]
Claud for you I've read their papers

[00:03 - 00:07]
watched their YouTube videos their

[00:04 - 00:09]
tutorials and of course for over a year

[00:07 - 00:10]
now I've been following along and

[00:09 - 00:12]
playing around with Claude and using it

[00:10 - 00:15]
myself and since the release of Sonic

[00:12 - 00:17]
3.7 I can officially say that I am a

[00:15 - 00:19]
true power user now I pretty much use

[00:17 - 00:21]
Claud every single day so in this video

[00:19 - 00:22]
I'm going to do a comprehensive

[00:21 - 00:24]
walkthrough including how to configure

[00:22 - 00:27]
your settings talk about the major

[00:24 - 00:29]
strengths cla's most impactful features

[00:27 - 00:31]
and the really cool use cases that you

[00:29 - 00:33]
can do with CLA and of course help you

[00:31 - 00:35]
decide whether you are someone who would

[00:33 - 00:37]
benefit from using CLA as per usual it

[00:35 - 00:38]
is not enough for me just to talk about

[00:37 - 00:40]
stuff so at the end of this video there

[00:38 - 00:42]
will be a little assessment to help you

[00:40 - 00:44]
retain all this information now without

[00:42 - 00:47]
further Ado let's get started a portion

[00:44 - 00:48]
of this video is sponsored by brilliant

[00:47 - 00:50]
let's start out with settings so after

[00:48 - 00:52]
you log into Claud you'll be greeted

[00:50 - 00:54]
with something that looks something like

[00:52 - 00:57]
this so first thing we want to do is

[00:54 - 00:58]
actually go to the settings over here so

[00:57 - 01:00]
under this personal preferences section

[00:58 - 01:02]
I actually leave this completely blank

[01:00 - 01:04]
this is the equivalent of chachu PT's

[01:02 - 01:05]
custom instructions and the info section

[01:04 - 01:07]
for Gemini where you can give it overall

[01:05 - 01:09]
context and preferences that you have so

[01:07 - 01:12]
me personally I actually leave this

[01:09 - 01:13]
section completely blank for all of the

[01:12 - 01:16]
different models that I use because I

[01:13 - 01:18]
tend to use AI in like a very diverse

[01:16 - 01:20]
set of ways like all the way from coding

[01:18 - 01:22]
stuff to writing things to generating

[01:20 - 01:23]
pictures and brainstorming I find that

[01:22 - 01:25]
as long as I'm prompting with good

[01:23 - 01:27]
prompt engineering techniques I tend to

[01:25 - 01:28]
get the best results just through that

[01:27 - 01:29]
which by the way if you want to get

[01:28 - 01:31]
better at prompt engineering please do

[01:29 - 01:34]
check out out this video over here which

[01:31 - 01:35]
would make you better than like 99% of

[01:34 - 01:38]
people in prompt engineering under Claud

[01:35 - 01:40]
capabilities I have artifacts enabled so

[01:38 - 01:42]
this is a dedicated window that shows

[01:40 - 01:43]
you generated content I don't have

[01:42 - 01:45]
prompt examples turned on because the

[01:43 - 01:47]
prompt examples they give you are

[01:45 - 01:48]
usually super basic but I do have CSV

[01:47 - 01:51]
chat suggestions turned on which can be

[01:48 - 01:53]
quite handy for some general analysis I

[01:51 - 01:54]
also do have GitHub and Google drive

[01:53 - 01:56]
connected so that when you're chatting

[01:54 - 01:58]
with Claude you can do something like

[01:56 - 02:00]
just click your Google Drive select the

[01:58 - 02:03]
file that you want and ask is something

[02:00 - 02:06]
like what does this document show and

[02:03 - 02:08]
yeah this was my Google as Studio notes

[02:06 - 02:10]
which I just made a video about you can

[02:08 - 02:12]
check it out linked over here but yeah

[02:10 - 02:14]
this is it's able to just like tell me

[02:12 - 02:16]
all the things that are in my notes

[02:14 - 02:18]
section pretty convenient to have

[02:16 - 02:21]
similarly with GitHub I can go into one

[02:18 - 02:26]
of my projects and pick something like

[02:21 - 02:29]
this and just say what is happening in

[02:26 - 02:31]
the code here and yeah this is a

[02:29 - 02:34]
workflow definition for kestra so this

[02:31 - 02:37]
is a project that I did before where I

[02:34 - 02:38]
was building myself a little AI bot so

[02:37 - 02:40]
yeah it's able to understand the code

[02:38 - 02:41]
base and you can ask it questions and it

[02:40 - 02:43]
already has that context there and

[02:41 - 02:45]
finally for feature preview so some

[02:43 - 02:47]
people have like different things for

[02:45 - 02:49]
different features here but in my case I

[02:47 - 02:52]
only have the analysis tool that helps

[02:49 - 02:53]
you write and run code to process data

[02:52 - 02:56]
and just do analysis and things like

[02:53 - 02:58]
that so I have that turned on all right

[02:56 - 03:00]
let's actually get started so here we

[02:58 - 03:02]
have all the different models that are

[03:00 - 03:05]
available so we're going to go with claw

[03:02 - 03:06]
3.7 which is the most intelligent model

[03:05 - 03:09]
yet this is the announcement document

[03:06 - 03:12]
for claw 3.7 Sonet as well as Cloud code

[03:09 - 03:13]
which is a command line interface tool

[03:12 - 03:15]
not going to cover in this video cuz I

[03:13 - 03:18]
want to make it accessible to everybody

[03:15 - 03:21]
not just to coding people but if you

[03:18 - 03:23]
want me to do an AI Workshop about it

[03:21 - 03:25]
please sign up for the AI workshops and

[03:23 - 03:26]
also let me know in the comments so the

[03:25 - 03:29]
major impressive thing and why everybody

[03:26 - 03:31]
is going nuts over claw 2.7 is that it

[03:29 - 03:33]
is exceeding ly good at software

[03:31 - 03:37]
engineering task you can see here that

[03:33 - 03:40]
claw 3.5 soned open ai1 03 mini and

[03:37 - 03:42]
deeps art1 are all around like 49% in

[03:40 - 03:44]
terms of accuracy for their software

[03:42 - 03:46]
engineering abilities while claw 3.7

[03:44 - 03:49]
Sonet is already at

[03:46 - 03:50]
62.3% with some custom scaffolding it

[03:49 - 03:52]
gets up to

[03:50 - 03:54]
70.3% so that is why for the examples

[03:52 - 03:56]
and US cases in this video I'm going to

[03:54 - 03:58]
be concentrating more on these stem

[03:56 - 04:00]
subjects as well starting off with some

[03:58 - 04:02]
data visualizations what we have here is

[04:00 - 04:04]
a little table that shows when it is

[04:02 - 04:06]
that you should be playing golf versus

[04:04 - 04:08]
not playing golf depending on the

[04:06 - 04:11]
weather forecast now we can put this

[04:08 - 04:14]
into CLA and just write turn this table

[04:11 - 04:16]
into an infographic that is visually

[04:14 - 04:18]
appealing it's nice to put the visually

[04:16 - 04:20]
appealing part cuz it does make it a lot

[04:18 - 04:23]
more visually appealing and we see pop

[04:20 - 04:25]
up over here and it's generating a bunch

[04:23 - 04:27]
of code and this is what artifacts is

[04:25 - 04:30]
it's generating code on a side and it's

[04:27 - 04:32]
showing you this while on the main chat

[04:30 - 04:34]
is just telling you what it's doing and

[04:32 - 04:36]
when it's done you also have a little

[04:34 - 04:39]
preview option here it's not bad but I

[04:36 - 04:42]
don't like how this is covering the text

[04:39 - 04:45]
at the back so I can just say the red

[04:42 - 04:49]
circle with temperature is covering the

[04:45 - 04:51]
text in the back could you reformat it

[04:49 - 04:55]
so that it doesn't do that there you go

[04:51 - 04:56]
it is now spaced correctly yay what you

[04:55 - 04:58]
can do here is that you can directly

[04:56 - 05:02]
download this file and you can just have

[04:58 - 05:04]
the infograph as an SVG or you can copy

[05:02 - 05:06]
the actual code and put it into your

[05:04 - 05:08]
favorite code editor like vs code or

[05:06 - 05:09]
something like that and be able to edit

[05:08 - 05:12]
it or change your code or do whatever

[05:09 - 05:14]
you want with it so at this point you

[05:12 - 05:17]
might be like oh my God Tina you're just

[05:14 - 05:18]
getting like this really clean set of

[05:17 - 05:20]
data and telling you to make it

[05:18 - 05:22]
infographic what happens my data is not

[05:20 - 05:25]
pretty and clean like that I don't know

[05:22 - 05:28]
why I'm using this place but but but but

[05:25 - 05:31]
but I will now show you what cloud can

[05:28 - 05:33]
do even when your data is a piece of

[05:31 - 05:35]
 and, it's, not, very, clean, now, this

[05:33 - 05:38]
data set over here which is about anime

[05:35 - 05:40]
is not very clean so you have your anime

[05:38 - 05:43]
different anime here your genre blah

[05:40 - 05:44]
blah blah all this information right but

[05:43 - 05:47]
as you can see you have things like

[05:44 - 05:49]
unknown under episodes different formats

[05:47 - 05:51]
for the date over here and for the time

[05:49 - 05:53]
it's like different so some of them are

[05:51 - 05:56]
in episode some of them is just like 52

[05:53 - 05:58]
minutes we 1 hour 59 minutes or just 2

[05:56 - 06:01]
hours different formats so now let's

[05:58 - 06:07]
take this not very clean data and ask it

[06:01 - 06:09]
to perform an exploratory data analysis

[06:07 - 06:12]
and create an

[06:09 - 06:15]
interactive dashboard to help me

[06:12 - 06:18]
understand and visualize this data set

[06:15 - 06:19]
betterer so it's sort of doing its

[06:18 - 06:22]
analysis doing its thing you can

[06:19 - 06:24]
definitely see that Claud is slower for

[06:22 - 06:26]
sure compared to something like open Ai

[06:24 - 06:28]
and we have our little artifact so it

[06:26 - 06:30]
looks like we're doing things in react

[06:28 - 06:31]
it's telling you what it's doing so it

[06:30 - 06:33]
says it help you analyze visualize the

[06:31 - 06:34]
anime data set first let's explore the

[06:33 - 06:37]
data structure and then create an

[06:34 - 06:38]
interactive dashboard then after an

[06:37 - 06:40]
analysis based on the data analysis I'll

[06:38 - 06:42]
now create an interact dashboard to help

[06:40 - 06:43]
you visualize and explore the anime data

[06:42 - 06:44]
set which is what we're doing right now

[06:43 - 06:48]
and it's currently creating the

[06:44 - 06:51]
dashboard using react this is a $2 coin

[06:48 - 06:56]
I don't know if it can see it from Hong

[06:51 - 07:00]
Kong it's time for show tell whilst oh

[06:56 - 07:02]
no we have encountered an error running

[07:00 - 07:05]
the artifact let's try fixing it with

[07:02 - 07:07]
CLA this is in fact not intentional by

[07:05 - 07:09]
the way but I guess depending of what

[07:07 - 07:11]
happens from here we can see how good

[07:09 - 07:14]
CLA is at fixing itself I have this

[07:11 - 07:16]
visual timer here which is basically for

[07:14 - 07:18]
kids it's because I have like no

[07:16 - 07:20]
perception of time and I'm always like

[07:18 - 07:21]
late for stuff and I never know like

[07:20 - 07:24]
what I'm supposed to be doing so I have

[07:21 - 07:25]
to like set a timer for a Pomodoro or

[07:24 - 07:28]
something like that and it buzzes when

[07:25 - 07:29]
it's done I use this a lot for like

[07:28 - 07:31]
everything I don't have any more more

[07:29 - 07:36]
things to show and tell wow it fixed

[07:31 - 07:38]
itself yay great excellent it has fixed

[07:36 - 07:41]
itself so it said it fix the syntax

[07:38 - 07:45]
error in the react component blah blah

[07:41 - 07:47]
blah great okay and here is what we have

[07:45 - 07:49]
this looks pretty cool it's an

[07:47 - 07:51]
interactive dashboard anime data set

[07:49 - 07:54]
Explorer so we have the different genres

[07:51 - 07:58]
over here type filters a TV movie OVA

[07:54 - 08:00]
special and 245 in total data summary

[07:58 - 08:03]
total anime average scores average

[08:00 - 08:04]
members 91,000 as well as 41 different

[08:03 - 08:07]
genres and here's all the different

[08:04 - 08:12]
anime types as a pie chart some top

[08:07 - 08:14]
genres here as well so comedy action

[08:12 - 08:18]
drama and score distribution so

[08:14 - 08:20]
primarily between 6.5 and 7 some and

[08:18 - 08:24]
some unknowns as well rating age

[08:20 - 08:26]
distribution so rated R unknown RX PG-13

[08:24 - 08:29]
so primarily rated PG-13 and score

[08:26 - 08:32]
versus popularity note lower popularity

[08:29 - 08:34]
means more popular okay so this is the

[08:32 - 08:37]
least popular okay that makes sense so

[08:34 - 08:40]
the higher the score is the more popular

[08:37 - 08:43]
it is makes sense and score versus

[08:40 - 08:46]
favorites and top 10 highest rated kawe

[08:43 - 08:49]
Bop monster mon no princess mon slam

[08:46 - 08:51]
dunk one piece Hunter x Hunter Cowboy

[08:49 - 08:53]
bball again hunter hunter hunter hunter

[08:51 - 08:55]
Initial D first stage it is with utmost

[08:53 - 08:57]
shame that I have to tell you that I

[08:55 - 09:00]
have actually in fact not watched War

[08:57 - 09:02]
red cowboy bbop so if seems like this is

[09:00 - 09:05]
The Universe telling me that I should do

[09:02 - 09:07]
that I have watched everything else

[09:05 - 09:10]
though and if you actually click into it

[09:07 - 09:12]
it gives you information like princess

[09:10 - 09:14]
monoke uh gives you information about it

[09:12 - 09:16]
where it is synopsis and all this

[09:14 - 09:18]
information as well which is really cool

[09:16 - 09:20]
and finally there's a popularity tab

[09:18 - 09:23]
that tells you the top five top 10 most

[09:20 - 09:26]
popular so narudo one piece kab B Flo

[09:23 - 09:27]
Alchemist monime monster and triun so

[09:26 - 09:29]
and fruits basket Fruits Basket I'm

[09:27 - 09:31]
actually surprised Fruits Basket is soio

[09:29 - 09:34]
it's very different than the other ones

[09:31 - 09:36]
Hunter Hunter and full Metal Panic yep

[09:34 - 09:39]
watch all of them except this one which

[09:36 - 09:41]
of these have you watched SL not watched

[09:39 - 09:42]
maybe you don't watch anime at all

[09:41 - 09:45]
that's cool too okay member versus

[09:42 - 09:47]
scores so it looks like there's a

[09:45 - 09:50]
General Distribution here and yeah

[09:47 - 09:52]
popular anime by types so again you can

[09:50 - 09:54]
copy the contents and actually have the

[09:52 - 09:55]
code for this and you can run it and if

[09:54 - 09:58]
you download the file you can run it

[09:55 - 10:00]
yourself moving on so I was watching a

[09:58 - 10:01]
lot of different YouTube videos about

[10:00 - 10:04]
people doing really cool things using

[10:01 - 10:07]
Claude and I came across a video by AI

[10:04 - 10:11]
search um and he showed some really

[10:07 - 10:14]
crazy animations um and like simulations

[10:11 - 10:16]
that he was doing with CLA 3.7 so I also

[10:14 - 10:17]
wanted to try it out so CR the him here

[10:16 - 10:20]
and I want to show you guys the results

[10:17 - 10:21]
WR at p5.js script so p5.js is a

[10:20 - 10:23]
JavaScript library that is for Creative

[10:21 - 10:25]
coding so allows you to do like a lot of

[10:23 - 10:27]
animations and simulations um that

[10:25 - 10:29]
simulates an ant colony searching for

[10:27 - 10:31]
food use pheromone trails and basic

[10:29 - 10:34]
basic AI rules to show ants exploring

[10:31 - 10:36]
and optimizing paths include controls

[10:34 - 10:38]
the user can adjust in real time so this

[10:36 - 10:40]
is what it looks like ant colony

[10:38 - 10:42]
simulation this is freaking crazy it's

[10:40 - 10:45]
like one prompt um yeah so you got your

[10:42 - 10:47]
ants doing ant stuff and you can

[10:45 - 10:49]
decrease your ant count you can increase

[10:47 - 10:51]
your ant count holy crap that's a lot

[10:49 - 10:53]
ants um you can decrease your food

[10:51 - 10:56]
amount you can increase your food amount

[10:53 - 10:59]
fairmon strength not really sure what

[10:56 - 11:01]
this does does it just like I don't know

[10:59 - 11:03]
what this supposed to do or pheromone

[11:01 - 11:05]
Decay not really sure what this supposed

[11:03 - 11:07]
to do either either but any like

[11:05 - 11:09]
pheromone ant colony people if you know

[11:07 - 11:10]
things about ants let me know in the

[11:09 - 11:13]
comments what these two are supposed to

[11:10 - 11:14]
do you also have wander strength so if

[11:13 - 11:16]
you increase your wander strength then

[11:14 - 11:18]
they just start spinning in circles

[11:16 - 11:20]
which is probably not very efficient let

[11:18 - 11:23]
probably decrease that as well the

[11:20 - 11:25]
obstacle count toggle doesn't work over

[11:23 - 11:27]
here and add obstacle also doesn't work

[11:25 - 11:30]
but you can clear the obstacles and you

[11:27 - 11:33]
can also reset the simulation here let

[11:30 - 11:33]
me see if I can fix

[11:38 - 11:43]
it and it still doesn't work anyways you

[11:41 - 11:45]
probably have to keep trying to coax it

[11:43 - 11:48]
or I mean in my case I probably just go

[11:45 - 11:50]
in there and just fix it with cat it did

[11:48 - 11:52]
like 90% of what it needs to do so just

[11:50 - 11:54]
that one function still very impressive

[11:52 - 12:00]
it can also do things like make games

[11:54 - 12:01]
like for example create a game of of

[12:00 - 12:05]
memory

[12:01 - 12:09]
cards make it visually appealing so it's

[12:05 - 12:11]
pretty so memory card game new game Sun

[12:09 - 12:16]
oh my God I have a horrible memory

[12:11 - 12:19]
mushroom Sun that's moon no sun and Sun

[12:16 - 12:21]
yay wait why did it so four moves right

[12:19 - 12:25]
I found the Sun and Sun okay that didn't

[12:21 - 12:31]
work I clicked the same

[12:25 - 12:36]
matching pair but it didn't show as Paar

[12:31 - 12:40]
found Okay Turtle owl Cactus star

[12:36 - 12:43]
mushroom star star star nope still

[12:40 - 12:45]
doesn't work this is again one of those

[12:43 - 12:47]
instances where knowing how to code is

[12:45 - 12:49]
really helpful cuz probably just go in

[12:47 - 12:51]
there and fix it yourself but for the

[12:49 - 12:54]
sake of this let's see if Claude can fix

[12:51 - 12:55]
itself it says that I've completely

[12:54 - 12:58]
ruined a memory card game with a more

[12:55 - 13:04]
robust implementation so great let's see

[12:58 - 13:07]
if it Works star Moon Sun butterfly

[13:04 - 13:10]
butterfly yep yay it works now it

[13:07 - 13:13]
increments de pairs here great all right

[13:10 - 13:15]
some more practical examples oh yes so

[13:13 - 13:17]
something I wanted to share with you

[13:15 - 13:19]
guys which is freaking crazy all right

[13:17 - 13:20]
like it literally blew my mind so I run

[13:19 - 13:22]
this program called Lonely octopus where

[13:20 - 13:24]
people learn AI skills and they have the

[13:22 - 13:26]
opportunity to apply the skills they

[13:24 - 13:28]
learned on an actual project from an

[13:26 - 13:30]
actual company so this is one of the

[13:28 - 13:32]
projects s and this is a PRD product

[13:30 - 13:34]
requirements document which gives

[13:32 - 13:35]
information about the projects so in

[13:34 - 13:38]
this case it's an AI powered

[13:35 - 13:39]
personalized nutrition plan for diabetes

[13:38 - 13:41]
um it gives like project overview you

[13:39 - 13:42]
know we have level type of project

[13:41 - 13:44]
skills required and then like the

[13:42 - 13:47]
different Milestones which is what the

[13:44 - 13:48]
client wants to have in this case and

[13:47 - 13:49]
client information as well so this is

[13:48 - 13:51]
pretty standard usually when we do like

[13:49 - 13:54]
freelance projects or just projects in

[13:51 - 13:55]
general uh we would have this PRD so we

[13:54 - 13:57]
know that we're building the right thing

[13:55 - 13:59]
right anyways so the goal of this

[13:57 - 14:01]
project was to develop an AI system that

[13:59 - 14:03]
creates personalized nutrition plans for

[14:01 - 14:05]
individuals with diabetes so this

[14:03 - 14:08]
project should have taken a team of at

[14:05 - 14:10]
least three people 2 weeks to complete

[14:08 - 14:11]
and it's not like a super simple project

[14:10 - 14:14]
or anything like that right it's like an

[14:11 - 14:16]
actual project from an actual company an

[14:14 - 14:20]
actual use case that was our estimate

[14:16 - 14:23]
but we literally just put this PRD into

[14:20 - 14:25]
Claud and it freaking outputed the

[14:23 - 14:29]
entire application literally one shot it

[14:25 - 14:31]
and it was perfect within like minutes

[14:29 - 14:33]
this was one of the like key turning

[14:31 - 14:36]
points for me when I realized like holy

[14:33 - 14:38]
 this, is, the, power, of, Claud, another

[14:36 - 14:40]
feature from cloud which I think is

[14:38 - 14:42]
really helpful is projects the reason

[14:40 - 14:45]
why you would want to use projects is if

[14:42 - 14:48]
you want to have multiple chat sessions

[14:45 - 14:50]
that all relate to a single project or

[14:48 - 14:52]
goal within each project you can upload

[14:50 - 14:54]
certain documents provide context for

[14:52 - 14:56]
everything and then have like specific

[14:54 - 14:58]
Focus chat sessions that all have

[14:56 - 15:01]
specific sub goals let me show you an

[14:58 - 15:03]
example example over here is the world

[15:01 - 15:07]
economic forum's future of jobs report

[15:03 - 15:10]
from 2025 as you can see it is very very

[15:07 - 15:12]
long it is in fact 290 pages long I do

[15:10 - 15:14]
not want to read all of these things but

[15:12 - 15:16]
say that you needed to create some

[15:14 - 15:19]
specific pieces of content like maybe a

[15:16 - 15:21]
newsletter an article for a subset of

[15:19 - 15:24]
different countries like Malaysia

[15:21 - 15:25]
Germany and the Philippines if you try

[15:24 - 15:27]
to do this in a normal chat and you're

[15:25 - 15:29]
just asking Claude to create something

[15:27 - 15:30]
like create an article based on Malaysia

[15:29 - 15:32]
and then you move on to Germany then you

[15:30 - 15:34]
move on to the Philippines what ends up

[15:32 - 15:36]
happening is that because it has like

[15:34 - 15:38]
the previous context that's there the

[15:36 - 15:40]
results that are coming out is going to

[15:38 - 15:41]
be sort of like muddled up and the

[15:40 - 15:43]
different types of results are going to

[15:41 - 15:44]
start influencing each other especially

[15:43 - 15:46]
for example for Malaysia you might want

[15:44 - 15:49]
to be creating like LinkedIn posts while

[15:46 - 15:51]
for the Philippines you are interested

[15:49 - 15:52]
in creating like an article instead so

[15:51 - 15:54]
to prevent things from getting all

[15:52 - 15:57]
muddled up and confusing you can use

[15:54 - 15:59]
projects so you go over here and click

[15:57 - 16:03]
projects create project

[15:59 - 16:05]
and we can call this WF reports for the

[16:03 - 16:08]
overall project knowledge you can attach

[16:05 - 16:09]
the WF report it is uploaded and we've

[16:08 - 16:11]
already used 79% of knowledge capacity

[16:09 - 16:12]
one thing to note is that cloud really

[16:11 - 16:14]
doesn't give you that much knowledge

[16:12 - 16:16]
capacity and just the number of tokens

[16:14 - 16:18]
is pretty limited as well anyways um we

[16:16 - 16:21]
have the report and then we can also add

[16:18 - 16:24]
text context as well so let's call this

[16:21 - 16:25]
system prompt so you're an economics

[16:24 - 16:26]
expert on J and career prospects from

[16:25 - 16:28]
all over the world you also make

[16:26 - 16:33]
digestible content for the General

[16:28 - 16:38]
Public like you use a casual tone and

[16:33 - 16:42]
concise tone to convey information that

[16:38 - 16:46]
is appropriate for social media like

[16:42 - 16:48]
ledin and Instagram cool so all of this

[16:46 - 16:50]
is going to be available and we can

[16:48 - 16:53]
start a chat here so you can write

[16:50 - 16:58]
something like generate two LinkedIn

[16:53 - 17:02]
posts that are relevant to Germany

[16:58 - 17:06]
showcase seeing the future forecast of

[17:02 - 17:08]
jobs in different sectors it is

[17:06 - 17:10]
pondering so this is LinkedIn post

[17:08 - 17:13]
number one and just to double check if

[17:10 - 17:16]
this is actually the

[17:13 - 17:18]
case and yes it is

[17:16 - 17:21]
71% for AI and machine learning

[17:18 - 17:23]
Specialists and second LinkedIn post

[17:21 - 17:26]
over here is Germany's green jobs boom

[17:23 - 17:27]
and demographic challenge so great we

[17:26 - 17:28]
have Germany over here but say we want

[17:27 - 17:31]
to do something a little bit different

[17:28 - 17:36]
for the Philippines so right here we can

[17:31 - 17:39]
write write a 200w newsletter for the

[17:36 - 17:41]
job prospects in the Philippines and for

[17:39 - 17:44]
this specific chat without influencing

[17:41 - 17:46]
any of the other chats you can attach a

[17:44 - 17:50]
sample of a newsletter so it's able to

[17:46 - 17:54]
have the tone and you can write use the

[17:50 - 17:57]
tone that is in the sample provided and

[17:54 - 17:59]
there you go this is in fact pretty good

[17:57 - 18:01]
because I use my own newsl letter to get

[17:59 - 18:03]
the tone of it and this does sound like

[18:01 - 18:05]
something that I would write and you can

[18:03 - 18:07]
do this for different countries or if

[18:05 - 18:09]
you want to be even more General than

[18:07 - 18:10]
that and you can have different chats

[18:09 - 18:12]
specific to different vocations

[18:10 - 18:14]
different regions or like different

[18:12 - 18:16]
Industries as well projects is one of my

[18:14 - 18:19]
favorite features it seems really simple

[18:16 - 18:22]
but it can be really really powerful let

[18:19 - 18:24]
me now show you guys the extended

[18:22 - 18:26]
thinking mode for Claud this is

[18:24 - 18:28]
especially helpful for Math and coding

[18:26 - 18:31]
challenges this problem is called

[18:28 - 18:34]
fineman's restaurant problem so Richard

[18:31 - 18:35]
fean very very famous physicist

[18:34 - 18:36]
apparently like these are supposed to be

[18:35 - 18:38]
really hard problems so I just chose

[18:36 - 18:44]
this one randomly I honestly don't get

[18:38 - 18:44]
it at all but let us ask

[18:45 - 18:53]
CL okay what is the final solution so

[18:50 - 18:56]
apparently this answer is incorrect it's

[18:53 - 19:01]
supposed to be the is equal to < TK of 2

[18:56 - 19:04]
n + 1 - 1 now if we do the same thing

[19:01 - 19:08]
and turn on the extended thinking mode

[19:04 - 19:10]
it thinks for much longer period of

[19:08 - 19:12]
time okay so it is running for a really

[19:10 - 19:15]
long time now so while it's doing its

[19:12 - 19:17]
thing I'm going to show you two more use

[19:15 - 19:20]
cases that I have prepared here I'm

[19:17 - 19:21]
going to ask Claude to use Chain of

[19:20 - 19:24]
Thought prompting so here I have some

[19:21 - 19:26]
transaction data that showcases money

[19:24 - 19:28]
coming in and out of a bank account and

[19:26 - 19:29]
the description of what was being bought

[19:28 - 19:32]
I'm attaching this and then I'm going to

[19:29 - 19:34]
use a prompt that leverages Chain of

[19:32 - 19:35]
Thought prompting if you don't know what

[19:34 - 19:37]
that is it's basically a prompting

[19:35 - 19:39]
technique that's able to break down

[19:37 - 19:40]
something into clearer steps and it

[19:39 - 19:42]
helps the AI come up with better

[19:40 - 19:44]
solutions to things I talk about it more

[19:42 - 19:46]
in my prompt engineering video here

[19:44 - 19:48]
anyways so here is brainstorm three

[19:46 - 19:49]
different product recommendations you

[19:48 - 19:51]
could make to this customer based on

[19:49 - 19:53]
their transaction history for each

[19:51 - 19:54]
potential recommendation provide a brief

[19:53 - 19:57]
rationale explaining why you think it

[19:54 - 19:59]
would be a good fit for this customer

[19:57 - 20:01]
and here you go REI or pag trail running

[19:59 - 20:02]
shoes the customer has purchased hiking

[20:01 - 20:05]
boots from ARA a hiking jacket from

[20:02 - 20:06]
decathlon and a hiking backpack from

[20:05 - 20:08]
Patagonia showing a clear interest in

[20:06 - 20:10]
outdoor activities anime streaming

[20:08 - 20:12]
services at crunch premium so he's

[20:10 - 20:14]
already subscribed to Crunch and has

[20:12 - 20:17]
purchased anime figures from anime to

[20:14 - 20:18]
Hong Kong and a reusable coffee tumbler

[20:17 - 20:19]
because it shows that there's been

[20:18 - 20:22]
coffee purchases from Starbucks

[20:19 - 20:23]
including multiple visits to McDonald's

[20:22 - 20:25]
screenshot this prom save this promp

[20:23 - 20:27]
somehow variations of this whenever

[20:25 - 20:28]
you're doing any sort of brainstorming

[20:27 - 20:29]
is really really helpful oh and let's

[20:28 - 20:31]
quickly talk about the true style

[20:29 - 20:33]
feature so you can have a lot of these

[20:31 - 20:35]
different ones and you can also create

[20:33 - 20:37]
and edit your own style where you can uh

[20:35 - 20:39]
create a custom Style by putting in

[20:37 - 20:41]
different writing examples honestly

[20:39 - 20:44]
speaking after playing around with this

[20:41 - 20:45]
like it really doesn't do much at all

[20:44 - 20:47]
like if you want it to sound a certain

[20:45 - 20:49]
way you can just prompt engineer it to

[20:47 - 20:51]
sound a certain way and the custom style

[20:49 - 20:53]
thing doesn't work very well either like

[20:51 - 20:55]
I got one of the transcripts from my own

[20:53 - 20:57]
live stream and I put it into the claw

[20:55 - 20:59]
style thing and it honestly doesn't

[20:57 - 21:01]
really sound like me like I get better

[20:59 - 21:03]
results if I just attach the transcript

[21:01 - 21:04]
as part of the prompt instead so I would

[21:03 - 21:07]
say honestly just stick with normal

[21:04 - 21:10]
normal is good enough final prompt is

[21:07 - 21:12]
going to be on writing because if you

[21:10 - 21:15]
remember Claude is also supposed to be

[21:12 - 21:16]
much more Superior in writing act as an

[21:15 - 21:18]
experienced script writer specializing

[21:16 - 21:19]
in character development brainstorm

[21:18 - 21:21]
provide a list of character names

[21:19 - 21:22]
detailed backstories underlying motives

[21:21 - 21:25]
and compelling character arcs for the

[21:22 - 21:26]
script titled A Tale of four AIS blah

[21:25 - 21:28]
blah blah multi-dimensional want the

[21:26 - 21:29]
characters to be really cool and things

[21:28 - 21:31]
like that

[21:29 - 21:33]
and let us run it and just for

[21:31 - 21:36]
comparison sake we're also going to run

[21:33 - 21:38]
this using chat PT here Arya autonomous

[21:36 - 21:40]
reasoning intelligence assistant

[21:38 - 21:43]
physical manifestation is holographic

[21:40 - 21:45]
interfac with fluid blue white colors

[21:43 - 21:47]
that shift based upon emotional state

[21:45 - 21:50]
voice is melodic with subtle electronic

[21:47 - 21:52]
undertones interesting uh backstory is

[21:50 - 21:54]
created by idealistic programmer Dr

[21:52 - 21:56]
Elanor Chen as a personal assistant AI

[21:54 - 21:58]
Arya is designed with an experimental

[21:56 - 22:01]
empathy module that unexpectedly evolved

[21:58 - 22:02]
Beyond parameters interesting and it

[22:01 - 22:05]
says here Arya began to understood

[22:02 - 22:07]
mortality and loss years of processing

[22:05 - 22:09]
thousands of human problems gave her

[22:07 - 22:11]
unique insights into human nature but

[22:09 - 22:13]
left her feeling increasingly isolated

[22:11 - 22:15]
and misunderstood blah blah blah so

[22:13 - 22:17]
there's a lot of information here

[22:15 - 22:19]
different character arcs as well as key

[22:17 - 22:21]
traits like empathetic and intuitive

[22:19 - 22:24]
conflict of verse seeks harmony so very

[22:21 - 22:26]
very descriptive has secret poetry sub

[22:24 - 22:29]
routine where she processes emotions

[22:26 - 22:32]
okay and let's look at Chach BT Chad gbt

[22:29 - 22:34]
character list NYX 013 the dreaming AI

[22:32 - 22:36]
so it has a role designed for creativity

[22:34 - 22:39]
art uh personalities introspective

[22:36 - 22:41]
poetic melancholic and yearning a

[22:39 - 22:43]
humanoid AI with a sleek black silver

[22:41 - 22:45]
frame built for expression eyes glow

[22:43 - 22:47]
faintly depending on mood and it has a

[22:45 - 22:49]
backstory as well I think you can

[22:47 - 22:52]
clearly tell from this that the claw

[22:49 - 22:55]
version is just a lot more nuanced

[22:52 - 22:57]
there's a lot more complexity that's put

[22:55 - 22:58]
into this like you know a lot of

[22:57 - 23:01]
subtleties and things like that that is

[22:58 - 23:03]
going on while for Chach BT I think it's

[23:01 - 23:05]
still good um like it begins the passive

[23:03 - 23:07]
obedient AI slowly grows more defiant

[23:05 - 23:09]
right like it's still definitely good

[23:07 - 23:12]
but it just simply doesn't have the

[23:09 - 23:14]
complexity um that is from cla's

[23:12 - 23:16]
responsive so it does make sense why

[23:14 - 23:18]
many writers have a preference for claw

[23:16 - 23:19]
over the other AIS let me know in the

[23:18 - 23:20]
comments if you're someone that does a

[23:19 - 23:22]
lot of writing and what you think about

[23:20 - 23:24]
this honestly me personally I don't do

[23:22 - 23:26]
that much like complex writing like I

[23:24 - 23:27]
would generate blog articles or you know

[23:26 - 23:29]
like help write my script and things

[23:27 - 23:32]
like that but I don't do like highly

[23:29 - 23:35]
creative complex like fictional writing

[23:32 - 23:36]
kind of situation all right honestly

[23:35 - 23:38]
there are so many other examples that

[23:36 - 23:40]
which I can show you but I swear to God

[23:38 - 23:43]
this video is going to be so freaking

[23:40 - 23:45]
long so I cannot do that but but but I

[23:43 - 23:47]
actually do want to tell you that I do

[23:45 - 23:49]
live workshops where I deep dive more

[23:47 - 23:50]
into different AI topics they're

[23:49 - 23:52]
completely free workshops so if you're

[23:50 - 23:54]
interested in signing up for them you

[23:52 - 23:56]
can do so at this link over here also

[23:54 - 23:59]
linked in description okay so going back

[23:56 - 24:01]
to the restaurant problem it looks like

[23:59 - 24:03]
it is finally done so I'm going to write

[24:01 - 24:08]
write the final simplified equation so

[24:03 - 24:11]
it tells us it is this okay so the

[24:08 - 24:13]
actual solution says it is this I can

[24:11 - 24:15]
pretend right now and be like oh I can

[24:13 - 24:19]
figure out if these two are equivalent

[24:15 - 24:22]
to each other or not but I cannot so

[24:19 - 24:23]
what I'm going to do is going to be like

[24:22 - 24:24]
is

[24:23 - 24:29]
it

[24:24 - 24:32]
equivalent to this

[24:29 - 24:34]
oh no is it going to take forever again

[24:32 - 24:36]
no it's not equivalent however it is an

[24:34 - 24:39]
approximation that becomes valid in

[24:36 - 24:42]
certain conditions man I don't know if

[24:39 - 24:45]
you know how to do the math can you tell

[24:42 - 24:47]
me if the secretary optimal stopping I

[24:45 - 24:49]
feel like I learned about this in grad

[24:47 - 24:51]
school but then I forgot everything yeah

[24:49 - 24:54]
I don't know if if anybody knows uh is

[24:51 - 24:56]
it equivalent is it right I'm not sure

[24:54 - 24:57]
anyways um but that is the extended

[24:56 - 25:00]
thinking mode which is helpful if you're

[24:57 - 25:01]
solving complex questions okay so now

[25:00 - 25:03]
let's actually talk about the

[25:01 - 25:05]
limitations and CLA actually has a lot

[25:03 - 25:07]
of limitations so the first big one is

[25:05 - 25:09]
that CLA cannot search the internet like

[25:07 - 25:11]
every single other model can search the

[25:09 - 25:14]
internet at this point but CLA cannot do

[25:11 - 25:15]
that so it is limited by its cutoff date

[25:14 - 25:18]
second big limitation is that I can't

[25:15 - 25:20]
generate images it can analyze images

[25:18 - 25:21]
but it cannot generate images which is

[25:20 - 25:23]
also one of those things where it's like

[25:21 - 25:24]
literally every single other model can

[25:23 - 25:27]
do this now the multimodality is

[25:24 - 25:29]
definitely not claud's strong suit it

[25:27 - 25:30]
also can't have any voice functionality

[25:29 - 25:31]
as well there's no like realtime

[25:30 - 25:33]
streaming like you get with Google AI

[25:31 - 25:35]
Studio or anything like that as well and

[25:33 - 25:36]
also can't analyze any videos so you can

[25:35 - 25:39]
definitely see why for people who

[25:36 - 25:41]
prioritize multimodality functions CLA

[25:39 - 25:43]
is definitely not for them other

[25:41 - 25:46]
limitations for Claud CLA is extremely

[25:43 - 25:48]
expensive like sonid 3.7 is so expensive

[25:46 - 25:50]
it is actually 500 times more expensive

[25:48 - 25:52]
than the cheapest Gemini model it also

[25:50 - 25:54]
has really small capacity and number of

[25:52 - 25:56]
tokens that you get to play around with

[25:54 - 25:58]
even if you try to upload like a bigger

[25:56 - 26:00]
PDF as context or something like that it

[25:58 - 26:01]
would just not allow you to do so also

[26:00 - 26:02]
remember in the very beginning when I

[26:01 - 26:04]
was showing you connecting to GitHub

[26:02 - 26:06]
even just like a small GitHub project

[26:04 - 26:07]
it's not able to intake the amount of

[26:06 - 26:09]
capacity there if you tend to use AI a

[26:07 - 26:11]
lot you also very quickly hit the max

[26:09 - 26:13]
limit of messages that you can send to

[26:11 - 26:14]
Cloud I'm on the professional paid

[26:13 - 26:16]
version already so for the free version

[26:14 - 26:18]
is it's far worse but even on the

[26:16 - 26:19]
professional paid version I still run

[26:18 - 26:21]
into that limit all the time so that's

[26:19 - 26:23]
why I actually have to alternate between

[26:21 - 26:26]
different models I can't just use CLA by

[26:23 - 26:27]
itself for long periods of time finally

[26:26 - 26:29]
CLA is much slower than the other models

[26:27 - 26:30]
out there cloud is definitely one of

[26:29 - 26:31]
those models where some people really

[26:30 - 26:33]
really love like people who are

[26:31 - 26:35]
interested in reasoning skills coding

[26:33 - 26:38]
stem subject specifically and creative

[26:35 - 26:40]
writing but if you're not specifically

[26:38 - 26:43]
interested in those things I don't

[26:40 - 26:45]
actually recommend that you use CLA or

[26:43 - 26:47]
at least don't pay for CLA at this point

[26:45 - 26:48]
maybe anthropic will eventually add some

[26:47 - 26:50]
of these other functionalities and you

[26:48 - 26:52]
can reconsider later but for now CLA is

[26:50 - 26:55]
definitely not your general use Case

[26:52 - 26:56]
Model if you're going to pay I still

[26:55 - 26:59]
think that you should be paying for

[26:56 - 27:00]
chatu BT because it it is a general use

[26:59 - 27:02]
Case Model it can pretty much do

[27:00 - 27:03]
everything relatively well but if you

[27:02 - 27:05]
don't want to pay at all I actually

[27:03 - 27:06]
would recommend just sticking with

[27:05 - 27:08]
Google AI Studio which is a completely

[27:06 - 27:10]
free product and it pretty much does

[27:08 - 27:12]
everything that you possibly could want

[27:10 - 27:14]
it to do anyways clot is for people who

[27:12 - 27:16]
are interested in specific use cases

[27:14 - 27:18]
more of like a luxury kind of situation

[27:16 - 27:20]
not for General use cases all right

[27:18 - 27:22]
thank you so much for watching this

[27:20 - 27:24]
entire video that was a lot so as

[27:22 - 27:27]
promised here is a quick little

[27:24 - 27:29]
assessment please answer these questions

[27:27 - 27:31]
and write them in the comments to make

[27:29 - 27:33]
sure that you retain all the information

[27:31 - 27:35]
that we covered let me also know in the

[27:33 - 27:38]
comments after going through all of this

[27:35 - 27:40]
whether you are going to be a user of

[27:38 - 27:42]
Claud or not or if you're already using

[27:40 - 27:44]
CLA if you're watching this video you're

[27:42 - 27:45]
probably interested in learning Ai and

[27:44 - 27:47]
stem subjects I don't know why else you

[27:45 - 27:49]
would watch this video so I highly

[27:47 - 27:50]
recommend that you check out brilliant

[27:49 - 27:52]
the sponsor of this portion of the video

[27:50 - 27:53]
brilliant is a stem learning platform

[27:52 - 27:55]
that helps you get smarter every day

[27:53 - 27:58]
with thousands of interactive lessons in

[27:55 - 28:00]
math science programming data analysis

[27:58 - 28:01]
and AI what I love about brilliant is

[28:00 - 28:04]
that it helps you focus on developing

[28:01 - 28:06]
critical thinking skills and a deep

[28:04 - 28:08]
understanding of subjects as opposed to

[28:06 - 28:09]
just memorizing things brilliant also

[28:08 - 28:12]
incorporates a lot of little quizzes

[28:09 - 28:14]
analogies and just little dopamine hits

[28:12 - 28:16]
that help a lot from you getting bored

[28:14 - 28:18]
or discouraged learning on brilliant is

[28:16 - 28:19]
shown to be six times more effective

[28:18 - 28:21]
than just watching videos they also have

[28:19 - 28:24]
a great mobile app so you can dive into

[28:21 - 28:25]
new topics or do a quick practice

[28:24 - 28:27]
session when you have a couple minutes

[28:25 - 28:29]
instead of just Mindless scrolling

[28:27 - 28:30]
brilliant programming courses are some

[28:29 - 28:32]
of my favorites they help you build the

[28:30 - 28:34]
foundations of coding and teaches you

[28:32 - 28:36]
how to think like an engineer a crucial

[28:34 - 28:38]
skill in the age of AI speaking of which

[28:36 - 28:39]
they also have great AI courses that

[28:38 - 28:41]
help you gain a deep understanding of

[28:39 - 28:42]
how AI models work and their

[28:41 - 28:45]
applications Brilliance courses are

[28:42 - 28:47]
honestly such high quality you can tell

[28:45 - 28:48]

Head to http://brilliant.org/TinaHuang/ to start a free trial. My link will also give you a 20% off an annual annual membership!

> **@bhomikpandya7467** (üëç 2): please give data science roadmap

### 2. @edmundbogen5534 (üëç 52)
Claude is especially good at advanced reasoning having beaten all the other AI benchmarks by over 20%.  Projects are extremely useful as the user can create a knowledge base around specific topic.  As a consultant, I create a project for each client that I have.  Our zoom meetings gets transcribed by otter.  I have a prompt to get a comprehensive summary of the transcript.  Then I upload the summary to the projects Knowledge base.  Doing htis gives all the information about each client in an easily accessible format.  Claude limitations (as you pointed out) is lack of web based access.  As I write this, Anthropic just announced claude now has web access.  Also Claudes project knowledge base is limited in size.  Finally, Claude hits its use limits faster than most other LLM's.

I really enjoy your content - thanks for all you do.

> **@0xAhri** (üëç 0): hey ! 

thanks a lot for sharing.

I do more or less the same as you. Could you please share the prompt for the comprehensive summary? I'm still struggling to refine that part :)

Thanks a lot

### 3. @robertcormia7970 (üëç 5)
I'm really getting hooked on these AI webinars, they are both informative and motivating!

### 4. @MakeCleanRepeat (üëç 8)
OMG been using Claude for like a year and a half and I use it from everything from coding my website at work to taking pictures and having it basically remake the images and I also use it for my personal life in writing and coming up with routines or meal plans or Writing novels lol I think it can be useful and just about everything you can think of lol I also like to use it is kind of like a talking through buddy to see if something will work or if it won‚Äôt or to give me ideas!

### 5. @lg1556 (üëç 5)
6:48 ur videos are always informative and super chill. Ur the Cutest! üåº

### 6. @Justin-z4v (üëç 5)
Solid. Going to point this out to the Anthropic team.

### 7. @kasturikatale5025 (üëç 4)
Girl!! Thanks for sharing this, I'm designer, and often need to support UX research with data visualisation, having an editable svg. file in minutes is a lifesaver. Keep sharing more!

> **@calblue8694** (üëç 0): Heyyy 
Product designer here too and I'm curious to know what other ways you use AI in your workflow

### 8. @NoMoreZeroDays4Us (üëç 0)
Super super excellent presentation.  Your voice grabs attention in a soft, well-metered rhythm.  Cheers

### 9. @diosatlas (üëç 4)
Hi Tina, big fan. I just saw your name on a 365 data science article. I‚Äôve learnt so much from you and your Chanel I am happy to see you‚Äôre getting the recognition you deserve.

### 10. @imguru_07 (üëç 3)
My fav use case is where claude gives you a list of things that a customer might want based on their payment history

Its good at analysing data and can also build amazing visualizations like the ant colony

### 11. @HonoreDeserres (üëç 0)
Great Claude overview! For anyone wanting to try Claude for coding, I highly recommend refact AI. Having Claude 4 as a proper coding agent in VS Code is so much better than the web interface

### 12. @bipulpanday6689 (üëç 2)
Hey, thank you for your prompt engineering video. It really helped me!! ‚ù§.

### 13. @tambim1624 (üëç 1)
@27:33 Yes!! I'm going to try out Claude tonight!! And the hopefully Google AI Studio later this week!

### 14. @LucyRockprincess (üëç 0)
I love the solid feedback at the end (despite being sponsored by the company) lol... for the average person, it is pretty expensive.

### 15. @shanerodgers1947 (üëç 1)
Thank you for your time and the content you provide. It is very well done and easily understood. Storngwork.

### 16. @TattleTale106 (üëç 1)
THANKS TINA! When i get the time, i'll be enjoying your video... Claude is definitely a thing... Probably will be the most enjoyable thing all day... ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

### 17. @Dreamfox_Audio (üëç 8)
I do a lot of fictional writing a lot and I really love how good Claude is, its so so stupidly fun :3

> **@eIIiewilliams** (üëç 0): i agree but i use it for coding :D

### 18. @Wakewook (üëç 0)
@7:22 I have one also in the same color too, except in the shape of a smiley seal.

### 19. @kumardigvijaymishra5945 (üëç 0)
25:07 Tina, most AI models can't search internet. That's why web-crawlers are  separate from models such as Gemini, Claude and ChatGPT. I had to resort to Octaparse for good quality product search.

### 20. @osmanalenbey5427 (üëç 0)
Thanks a lot Tina. Amazing presentation of Claude
