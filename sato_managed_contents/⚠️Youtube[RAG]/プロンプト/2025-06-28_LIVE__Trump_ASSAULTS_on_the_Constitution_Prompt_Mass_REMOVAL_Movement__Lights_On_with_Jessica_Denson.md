Lights on! As the Supreme Court edges dangerously close to allowing Trump's unconstitutional termination of birthright citizenship, millions of Americans are preparing to fill the streets with demands for his removal on July 4 and July 17.  Alisa of 50501DC joins Jessica Denson LIVE from an impeachment protest for the announcement of their major upcoming march on Washington.

[00:01 - 00:07]
It's time for some good trouble. I'm

[00:04 - 00:08]
Jessica Densen and this is Lights On. If

[00:07 - 00:10]
you're not already subscribed, please

[00:08 - 00:13]
subscribe to the Jessica Densson YouTube

[00:10 - 00:16]
channel where you you are watching this

[00:13 - 00:18]
show. Lights on is a movement. We were

[00:16 - 00:20]
called out and referenced by

[00:18 - 00:23]
Representative Al Green this week who in

[00:20 - 00:25]
the spirit of John Lewis and that good

[00:23 - 00:27]
trouble that he encouraged forced an

[00:25 - 00:29]
impeachment vote in the House of

[00:27 - 00:31]
Representatives. That movement is

[00:29 - 00:32]
growing. I am going to tell you more

[00:31 - 00:34]
about it. Today's show is really all

[00:32 - 00:36]
about it and the growing movement of

[00:34 - 00:39]
people in the streets that are demanding

[00:36 - 00:40]
the removal of this illegal, felonious,

[00:39 - 00:43]
unconstitutional

[00:40 - 00:44]
regime that we are living through. As

[00:43 - 00:47]
you know, as you have probably heard

[00:44 - 00:50]
today, the Supreme Court led by the

[00:47 - 00:54]
conservative majority 63

[00:50 - 00:55]
essentially green lit for the time being

[00:54 - 00:58]
a

[00:55 - 01:00]
furtherance of Donald Trump's attack on

[00:58 - 01:02]
the 14th amendment section one

[01:00 - 01:04]
birthright citizenship. The 14th

[01:02 - 01:06]
amendment, okay, the 14th amendment of

[01:04 - 01:09]
our constitution is what gave humanity

[01:06 - 01:12]
to our constitution. what what ceased to

[01:09 - 01:15]
refer to people as partial people, what

[01:12 - 01:17]
establish humanity and and dignity for

[01:15 - 01:19]
the human race in the United States of

[01:17 - 01:23]
America. And he has attacked the first

[01:19 - 01:24]
article of section one of the 14th

[01:23 - 01:28]
amendment and trying to end birthright

[01:24 - 01:31]
citizenship. And today the Supreme Court

[01:28 - 01:33]
ruled that he could essentially um there

[01:31 - 01:35]
there could not be nationwide

[01:33 - 01:37]
injunctions. They granted the

[01:35 - 01:39]
administration's request to narrow the

[01:37 - 01:41]
scope of three so-called univers

[01:39 - 01:44]
universal injunctions issued by federal

[01:41 - 01:46]
judges in Maryland, Massachusetts, and

[01:44 - 01:48]
Washington state that halted enforcement

[01:46 - 01:51]
of his directive nationwide while

[01:48 - 01:54]
litigation challenging the policy plays

[01:51 - 01:56]
out. So what they did was they stepped

[01:54 - 02:00]
back, not ruling on the actual merits of

[01:56 - 02:03]
the case, but buying into this kind of

[02:00 - 02:05]
shell game that I know all too well that

[02:03 - 02:08]
that the Trump world plays in trying to

[02:05 - 02:11]
get legal rulings in their favor. This

[02:08 - 02:14]
could have massive implications for

[02:11 - 02:16]
babies being born in this country very

[02:14 - 02:20]
very soon. It is going to require so

[02:16 - 02:21]
many lawsuits to otherwise to address

[02:20 - 02:24]
what could have been addressed by

[02:21 - 02:26]
nationwide injunctions. And they have

[02:24 - 02:28]
punted actually handing handling this

[02:26 - 02:31]
issue on the merits. handling the

[02:28 - 02:35]
obscene argument that Trump has tried to

[02:31 - 02:37]
make that children of non-citizens who

[02:35 - 02:39]
are born in this country that those

[02:37 - 02:42]
parents are not subject to the

[02:39 - 02:44]
jurisdiction of the United States as it

[02:42 - 02:47]
explains in section one of the 14th

[02:44 - 02:49]
amendment. I have had scholars of the

[02:47 - 02:51]
14th amendment on this show explaining

[02:49 - 02:54]
why that argument is complete garbage.

[02:51 - 02:58]
It is completely unconstitutional. It is

[02:54 - 03:01]
one of so many assaults on our

[02:58 - 03:04]
constitutional order that really are

[03:01 - 03:05]
just boiled down to inhumity. It's the

[03:04 - 03:08]
same kind of thing we're seeing played

[03:05 - 03:10]
out in a daily basis in these terrorism

[03:08 - 03:15]
raids being carried out by ICE. Just the

[03:10 - 03:17]
sheer sheer inhumanity of these visuals,

[03:15 - 03:19]
these these images we are seeing of

[03:17 - 03:21]
people who have been here for decades

[03:19 - 03:24]
living

[03:21 - 03:26]
crimefree lives where they pay taxes,

[03:24 - 03:28]
where they work hard, where they have

[03:26 - 03:30]
children, who are enlisted in our

[03:28 - 03:32]
military, in service to this country.

[03:30 - 03:35]
And they are targeting these

[03:32 - 03:36]
individuals, snatching them off the

[03:35 - 03:38]
streets, in the worst case, beating

[03:36 - 03:40]
them, hurting them, putting them in

[03:38 - 03:41]
detention centers where they literally

[03:40 - 03:44]
don't get a change of clothes out of

[03:41 - 03:46]
their bloody clothing for days and have

[03:44 - 03:50]
to sleep on the floor with other people

[03:46 - 03:52]
who have been detained. It is inhumane.

[03:50 - 03:55]
It is unamerican. It is disgusting. It

[03:52 - 03:57]
is fascist. This is being carried out by

[03:55 - 03:59]
a criminal president who is there

[03:57 - 04:02]
illegally in violation of section three

[03:59 - 04:05]
of the 14th amendment and who has an

[04:02 - 04:08]
entire administration that is unfit and

[04:05 - 04:10]
disqualified. So there is a massive

[04:08 - 04:14]
massive movement out there right now to

[04:10 - 04:15]
have him removed. Um I mentioned to you

[04:14 - 04:19]
that we have been at the heart of the

[04:15 - 04:22]
impeachment and removal movement. I a

[04:19 - 04:25]
few weeks ago founded the removal co uh

[04:22 - 04:27]
coalition which is a simply a coalition

[04:25 - 04:30]
that serves to amplify the grassroots

[04:27 - 04:33]
organizations that are explicitly

[04:30 - 04:38]
demanding removal of Donald Trump from

[04:33 - 04:40]
office. Among them are 5051 DC which is

[04:38 - 04:42]
has I've been so happy to be working

[04:40 - 04:43]
with really over the past few months.

[04:42 - 04:47]
They were one of our partner

[04:43 - 04:49]
organizations for the 314 march on in

[04:47 - 04:51]
Washington, the veterans march that

[04:49 - 04:54]
honored our veterans in honor of section

[04:51 - 04:56]
3 of the 14th amendment. And they have a

[04:54 - 04:59]
major announcement today live from a

[04:56 - 05:01]
protest. The secretary of 5051 DC is

[04:59 - 05:04]
going to join us live. So I'm very

[05:01 - 05:05]
excited to be joined by her. I'm also uh

[05:04 - 05:07]
involved with them on the back end in

[05:05 - 05:09]
planning for this upcoming event that

[05:07 - 05:11]
she's going to announce today. Um, but

[05:09 - 05:13]
before we do that, I just wanted to give

[05:11 - 05:15]
you the comment that I got today from

[05:13 - 05:18]
Evan Bernick about this birthright

[05:15 - 05:19]
citizenship case. Now, Evan is a

[05:18 - 05:23]
frequent guest on the show. He has

[05:19 - 05:25]
spoken here um on with extreme clarity

[05:23 - 05:27]
on the issue of section three of the

[05:25 - 05:29]
14th amendment and why Trump is in fact

[05:27 - 05:31]
an illegal president and remains

[05:29 - 05:35]
disqualified to this moment. really

[05:31 - 05:37]
foundationally the threshold of every

[05:35 - 05:41]
action that he takes can't even be

[05:37 - 05:43]
legally passed because his his existence

[05:41 - 05:44]
as a president is not valid. It is a

[05:43 - 05:47]
constitutional violation in and of

[05:44 - 05:48]
itself. But Evan, when I reached out to

[05:47 - 05:51]
him today about this order, sent me this

[05:48 - 05:53]
me message back. He said, "It's about as

[05:51 - 05:55]
bad as it could be given that the court

[05:53 - 05:57]
didn't reach the merits of whether the

[05:55 - 05:59]
order was constitutional. It will make

[05:57 - 06:01]
it harder across the board in every area

[05:59 - 06:04]
of law for people to challenge the

[06:01 - 06:06]
administration's illegal actions. And

[06:04 - 06:08]
the court is convinced or pretending to

[06:06 - 06:10]
be convinced that it can trust the

[06:08 - 06:12]
administration's promises to play by the

[06:10 - 06:14]
rules and accept the court's authority.

[06:12 - 06:16]
That's the most troubling part. It

[06:14 - 06:18]
hasn't learned from the administration's

[06:16 - 06:20]
defiance of its own orders and its

[06:18 - 06:22]
obvious disregard for settled law.

[06:20 - 06:24]
doesn't take account of the fact that

[06:22 - 06:26]
the administration refused to make any

[06:24 - 06:28]
promises that it would follow lower

[06:26 - 06:30]
court decisions about birthright

[06:28 - 06:34]
citizenship, doesn't seem to know what

[06:30 - 06:37]
it is dealing with, or worse doesn't or

[06:34 - 06:40]
worse does and doesn't care or agrees. I

[06:37 - 06:41]
think Katanji Brown Jackson's dissent

[06:40 - 06:44]
strikes all the right notes and

[06:41 - 06:45]
appreciates the stakes. This was a test

[06:44 - 06:47]
of the court's understanding of the

[06:45 - 06:51]
administration's threat to the rule of

[06:47 - 06:54]
law, and the court failed it.

[06:51 - 06:56]
one of many instances of how the Supreme

[06:54 - 06:58]
Court has failed us. Obviously, they are

[06:56 - 07:01]
part and parcel of the reason why we

[06:58 - 07:03]
find ourselves in this unthinkable

[07:01 - 07:05]
predicament right now because Donald

[07:03 - 07:07]
Trump number one should never have been

[07:05 - 07:09]
allowed to run for president. Uh number

[07:07 - 07:11]
two, you should never have any kind of

[07:09 - 07:13]
immunity for crimes committed by a

[07:11 - 07:15]
president as so-called official acts.

[07:13 - 07:16]
the rulings that have come out this of

[07:15 - 07:19]
this Supreme Court which in and of

[07:16 - 07:25]
itself is so deeply compromised as we

[07:19 - 07:26]
know are why we are here. But we um I

[07:25 - 07:28]
see in the background we have Alisa

[07:26 - 07:31]
waiting for us now. She is live

[07:28 - 07:34]
literally live from a pop-up protest in

[07:31 - 07:37]
Washington DC. This po protest is

[07:34 - 07:40]
explicitly focused on impeachment. It is

[07:37 - 07:42]
it is directed at engaging very

[07:40 - 07:43]
specifically with the community and

[07:42 - 07:46]
parts of the community that are not

[07:43 - 07:51]
usually engaged. So, I'm really excited

[07:46 - 07:52]
to welcome Alisa from 55. Hi, Alisa. Hi.

[07:51 - 07:54]
How's it going? Can you hear me? Oh,

[07:52 - 07:59]
yes. We hear you. Great. And I love your

[07:54 - 08:02]
sign. Thank you. It says impeach and um

[07:59 - 08:05]
reform. Reclaim. Impeach. Reclaim. Did

[08:02 - 08:07]
it say Oh, I forgot what I wrote on it.

[08:05 - 08:09]
Beautiful.

[08:07 - 08:12]
So, and I love the American flags. All

[08:09 - 08:14]
all about claiming back those symbols of

[08:12 - 08:16]
patriotism and freedom and democracy

[08:14 - 08:19]
that these fascists have tried to hijack

[08:16 - 08:21]
from us. Can you first of all, I know we

[08:19 - 08:23]
have a big announcement from you at 5051

[08:21 - 08:26]
DC, but just tell me what you're doing

[08:23 - 08:29]
right now. So, right now, we are working

[08:26 - 08:31]
on our popup protests. Um, so these

[08:29 - 08:34]
protests are built to specifically

[08:31 - 08:36]
engage the people who may be in

[08:34 - 08:40]
particular disengaged from what's going

[08:36 - 08:42]
on. Um, so a lot of people may not be

[08:40 - 08:44]
inside of the political sphere. So we're

[08:42 - 08:46]
bringing um our message to the people.

[08:44 - 08:48]
So what we're going to be doing is we're

[08:46 - 08:50]
going to be walking through um like

[08:48 - 08:52]
neighborhoods, popular night life areas

[08:50 - 08:54]
um with our signs. We're going to be

[08:52 - 08:55]
speaking to people and we're even going

[08:54 - 08:56]
to be singing. So it's going to be

[08:55 - 08:58]
really great. It's going to be really

[08:56 - 09:00]
fun. We're all really excited. Nice.

[08:58 - 09:02]
Nice. So, you just got out there and got

[09:00 - 09:04]
started tonight, right? That's right.

[09:02 - 09:05]
This is actually our first day that

[09:04 - 09:07]
we're doing these uh but we're going to

[09:05 - 09:09]
be doing these weekly. So, we're really

[09:07 - 09:11]
excited to continue to do this. Nice.

[09:09 - 09:13]
And I love that aspect of trying to

[09:11 - 09:15]
reach people that aren't usually engaged

[09:13 - 09:17]
because whether it's a particular like

[09:15 - 09:19]
demographic or part of the community or

[09:17 - 09:21]
even just like people in the public, you

[09:19 - 09:23]
and I Alisa and those and the people

[09:21 - 09:25]
standing behind you and like all of us

[09:23 - 09:29]
in this

[09:25 - 09:30]
are so deeply engaged and we know that

[09:29 - 09:33]
the minute by minute of everything

[09:30 - 09:34]
that's going on. But but it's it you you

[09:33 - 09:36]
sometimes can't believe it. But believe

[09:34 - 09:39]
it or not, there are people out there

[09:36 - 09:41]
who this fascist regime has not yet

[09:39 - 09:43]
touched the lives of. And one day it is

[09:41 - 09:45]
going to touch their lives. So we're

[09:43 - 09:50]
trying to let them know before it's too

[09:45 - 09:52]
late. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So I've been

[09:50 - 09:54]
really excited to be joining you guys in

[09:52 - 09:56]
the planning for the upcoming event in

[09:54 - 09:59]
mid July that is centered around the

[09:56 - 10:02]
call to action on July 17th in honor of

[09:59 - 10:04]
John Lewis Good Trouble Day. Can you

[10:02 - 10:08]
tell me tell me the big announcement for

[10:04 - 10:11]
what 50-51 is planning? Yeah, so um as

[10:08 - 10:14]
you guys probably know 5051 in general

[10:11 - 10:17]
um has a day of action on the 17th of

[10:14 - 10:19]
July. Um but 5051 DC is they're really

[10:17 - 10:21]
excited to state that we are joining

[10:19 - 10:23]
this and we are going to be doing a

[10:21 - 10:24]
march. So we're really excited to do

[10:23 - 10:27]
this and to be working together for

[10:24 - 10:30]
this. This is a day of solidarity. Um,

[10:27 - 10:33]
and this is a day of um, really coming

[10:30 - 10:35]
together and realizing that we um, are

[10:33 - 10:37]
part of one group. We're all going to be

[10:35 - 10:39]
affected with this. So, we have to stand

[10:37 - 10:42]
together.

[10:39 - 10:45]
Yeah, we absolutely do. And and there's

[10:42 - 10:49]
so much that the civil rights movement

[10:45 - 10:51]
in particular teaches us about to handle

[10:49 - 10:53]
this moment. Um, do you have do you have

[10:51 - 10:56]
like two or three minutes? I wanted to

[10:53 - 11:00]
read from an article about Reverend um

[10:56 - 11:02]
about Reverend uh Lawson who was a a

[11:00 - 11:05]
civil rights icon and just the lessons

[11:02 - 11:09]
that he has for this moment I think are

[11:05 - 11:12]
so salient so so instructive. Um this is

[11:09 - 11:16]
from an article in the Guardian recently

[11:12 - 11:18]
by Deepo uh Bargava. I'm trying to get

[11:16 - 11:20]
the the graphic up on the screen for

[11:18 - 11:23]
you. It's it's full of full of

[11:20 - 11:24]
instruction about how we can handle this

[11:23 - 11:26]
assault that we're dealing with right

[11:24 - 11:29]
now. It's called We Are No Longer Free,

[11:26 - 11:30]
but we can win our freedom back. It's in

[11:29 - 11:33]
the Guardian right now. I highly suggest

[11:30 - 11:37]
looking it up. And he talks about he

[11:33 - 11:39]
talks about how it's not just one aspect

[11:37 - 11:40]
of our resistance that's going to work.

[11:39 - 11:42]
It's going to take everything. It's

[11:40 - 11:44]
going to take the protests. It's going

[11:42 - 11:46]
to take the lawsuits. It's going to take

[11:44 - 11:49]
the boycott. It's going to take the

[11:46 - 11:50]
civil disobedience. Yes. In fact, we're

[11:49 - 11:53]
going to have to start getting

[11:50 - 11:57]
comfortable with some civil disobedience

[11:53 - 12:01]
as John Lewis did. Um, but he he talks

[11:57 - 12:03]
about um first of all the importance of

[12:01 - 12:05]
this moment and Alisa, you know this

[12:03 - 12:07]
from my chats with you guys privately

[12:05 - 12:09]
and my audience knows it well. Like I I

[12:07 - 12:12]
am so honed in on the urgency of the

[12:09 - 12:14]
moment right now that we can't wait for

[12:12 - 12:16]
more damage to be done. And Deepo writes

[12:14 - 12:18]
in this article, we have a precious

[12:16 - 12:20]
window of time to organize and descent

[12:18 - 12:22]
openly. We can take hope from large

[12:20 - 12:24]
cases around the world when everyday

[12:22 - 12:26]
people have made that choice in large

[12:24 - 12:29]
numbers. U-turns happen. Scholars have

[12:26 - 12:30]
found that 733% of episodes of

[12:29 - 12:32]
authoritarian breakthrough around the

[12:30 - 12:34]
world in the last 30 years have been

[12:32 - 12:36]
followed by democratic revivals.

[12:34 - 12:38]
Sometimes those revivals bring about an

[12:36 - 12:40]
even stronger democracy than what came

[12:38 - 12:42]
before. But U-turns aren't

[12:40 - 12:45]
self-executing and the time to act is

[12:42 - 12:47]
limited. Comparable cases like India and

[12:45 - 12:49]
Hungary suggest that if authoritarianism

[12:47 - 12:50]
is not effectively challenged in the

[12:49 - 12:54]
first couple of years, it can deepen and

[12:50 - 12:57]
become the new normal for a decade or

[12:54 - 12:58]
more. And he also brings about how

[12:57 - 13:00]
Reverend Larson and his contemporaries

[12:58 - 13:02]
did not promise an easy path. Millions

[13:00 - 13:04]
of us will have to reckon honestly with

[13:02 - 13:08]
our current reality. We will need to

[13:04 - 13:09]
take need to make the choice to act. We

[13:08 - 13:12]
will need to contribute our time,

[13:09 - 13:15]
talent, and money strategically. We will

[13:12 - 13:18]
have to tap a deep reservoir of courage

[13:15 - 13:21]
and love we didn't know we had. Reverend

[13:18 - 13:24]
Lawson's key teaching was hopeful. If we

[13:21 - 13:26]
do those things, we can get free if we

[13:24 - 13:29]
do. Exactly.

[13:26 - 13:32]
So you guys at 5051, listen, I'm in the

[13:29 - 13:33]
back end watching, you know, even when

[13:32 - 13:35]
I'm not engaged in the planning with you

[13:33 - 13:38]
guys. I'm watching every single day

[13:35 - 13:41]
people show up for a protest of 10

[13:38 - 13:42]
people or a protest of even a handful of

[13:41 - 13:44]
people. And sometimes it's hundreds,

[13:42 - 13:46]
sometimes it's thousands, but you're

[13:44 - 13:48]
there for everything. You are engaged.

[13:46 - 13:50]
You're not willing to let this go down

[13:48 - 13:53]
on your watch. And for what you're

[13:50 - 13:55]
planning for July 17th, I know because

[13:53 - 13:57]
I've done one of these things before, it

[13:55 - 14:00]
is not cheap. It takes money. It takes

[13:57 - 14:04]
infrastructure. Can you tell me about um

[14:00 - 14:06]
what your needs are from us to help you

[14:04 - 14:10]
pull off the event, the March on

[14:06 - 14:12]
Washington? Of course. So, basically um

[14:10 - 14:16]
this is a march, right? So, marches do

[14:12 - 14:17]
have specific needs. Um some of it we

[14:16 - 14:20]
have covered but one of the things that

[14:17 - 14:24]
we absolutely do not have at this moment

[14:20 - 14:26]
is basically um a sound system and we

[14:24 - 14:29]
are working on that. Um however it is

[14:26 - 14:32]
difficult to find one um that is going

[14:29 - 14:35]
to be working for us um of course within

[14:32 - 14:38]
our budget. Um there's also of course um

[14:35 - 14:40]
going to be uh portaotties. People have

[14:38 - 14:42]
to be able to go to the bathroom. that

[14:40 - 14:45]
is part of the NPS uh requirements as

[14:42 - 14:48]
well as the um requirements for any type

[14:45 - 14:50]
of protest inside of DC. Um so um there

[14:48 - 14:52]
are also water coolers, things like

[14:50 - 14:54]
that. Like it's in the middle of the

[14:52 - 14:57]
summer, so all of these things are going

[14:54 - 15:00]
to have to be taken care of. So um those

[14:57 - 15:01]
are, you know, just a brief list of

[15:00 - 15:03]
kinds of things that we have to be

[15:01 - 15:05]
worried about when it comes to this.

[15:03 - 15:07]
Yeah, absolutely. It is it is expensive.

[15:05 - 15:09]
Like I like you guys know here on Lights

[15:07 - 15:10]
On. If you've been on this show before,

[15:09 - 15:12]
I've put these things on. I've

[15:10 - 15:14]
fundraised on this show. It takes a lot

[15:12 - 15:16]
of money. All the, you know, so many

[15:14 - 15:18]
things have to be done permit-wise with

[15:16 - 15:20]
National Parks or whatever agency you're

[15:18 - 15:21]
working with to make sure that everybody

[15:20 - 15:23]
is safe, that everybody has the

[15:21 - 15:25]
facilities they need, that everybody can

[15:23 - 15:27]
hear and see what's going on. None of

[15:25 - 15:30]
this is cheap. It takes a lot of

[15:27 - 15:31]
infrastructure. So, if you can, please

[15:30 - 15:34]
go to the link that's in the

[15:31 - 15:37]
description. I also just put it up in

[15:34 - 15:39]
the chat. Actually, let me put a banner

[15:37 - 15:41]
on the screen as well, just for uh the

[15:39 - 15:44]
rest of the show with you, Alisa. If you

[15:41 - 15:48]
can support at all, please go to this

[15:44 - 15:52]
website now and support 5051DC in their

[15:48 - 15:55]
efforts to to stage this March on

[15:52 - 15:58]
Washington. Um, also I just I'm very, as

[15:55 - 16:02]
I mentioned at the top, so happy that

[15:58 - 16:04]
5051DC is in the removal coalition. Uh I

[16:02 - 16:06]
have been so explicit with my audience

[16:04 - 16:08]
and and everybody that I interact with

[16:06 - 16:10]
that I think a missing part of the

[16:08 - 16:13]
protest space is direct messaging,

[16:10 - 16:15]
direct demands. What are we demanding?

[16:13 - 16:19]
What do we want the media to pick up on

[16:15 - 16:22]
and the and the lawmakers to feel our

[16:19 - 16:24]
pressure about and and get Can you talk

[16:22 - 16:26]
about uh you know just kind of the

[16:24 - 16:27]
mergence of 5051 in the removal

[16:26 - 16:29]
coalition? I mean it's right it's right

[16:27 - 16:32]
on message with what you're doing today.

[16:29 - 16:37]
Yeah. Yeah, MAGA has got to go, right?

[16:32 - 16:39]
Okay, thank you. Um, so yes, um, I have

[16:37 - 16:42]
I completely agree with you as part of

[16:39 - 16:45]
my coalition with um, 5051 DC and also

[16:42 - 16:47]
I'm part of uh, political revolution.

[16:45 - 16:50]
Um, we basically have been doing a huge

[16:47 - 16:52]
amount of research as to what makes

[16:50 - 16:54]
these kinds of movements successful. And

[16:52 - 16:57]
one of the things that we found is going

[16:54 - 17:00]
to be specific demands. So, it's not

[16:57 - 17:02]
just showing up to a protest and saying,

[17:00 - 17:03]
you know, this has got to go. I don't

[17:02 - 17:06]
like what's going on. You have to have a

[17:03 - 17:08]
specific demand. And our demand, we have

[17:06 - 17:11]
a couple demands, but one of the demands

[17:08 - 17:14]
that we have is impeachment. Um,

[17:11 - 17:16]
impeachment and removal. Um, and another

[17:14 - 17:18]
thing, as I'm sure you will say, you

[17:16 - 17:20]
know, um, end executive overreach,

[17:18 - 17:22]
right? Um, over that is a huge problem

[17:20 - 17:25]
that's going on right now, right? Um,

[17:22 - 17:29]
and of course reform of what is going

[17:25 - 17:31]
on. Um because if what is happening here

[17:29 - 17:34]
is been allowed to happen by the system,

[17:31 - 17:35]
it's got to change. So it doesn't even

[17:34 - 17:39]
just stop there. Um it's got to

[17:35 - 17:41]
continue. Like even after, let's say, um

[17:39 - 17:44]
all of this comes to pass, we're going

[17:41 - 17:48]
to have to work hard for a very long

[17:44 - 17:50]
time to make sure that um that this does

[17:48 - 17:52]
not happen again. Absolutely. And when

[17:50 - 17:57]
you talk about ending executive

[17:52 - 18:00]
overreach, I mean basically this this

[17:57 - 18:03]
caricature of a presidency that we have

[18:00 - 18:06]
right now has really the silver lining

[18:03 - 18:09]
kind of of this whole situation. It is

[18:06 - 18:11]
it has brought to the surface so much

[18:09 - 18:14]
filth that has been lingering for so

[18:11 - 18:16]
long. Exactly. It really needs to be

[18:14 - 18:18]
rooted out and cleaned up. And if we

[18:16 - 18:20]
really seize on this moment in the right

[18:18 - 18:23]
way, understand this for the opportunity

[18:20 - 18:25]
it is, not only will we impeach,

[18:23 - 18:28]
convict, and remove Trump and the rest

[18:25 - 18:30]
of the corrupt, illegal administration,

[18:28 - 18:33]
we will root out this corruption that

[18:30 - 18:37]
has been infesting our democracy, our

[18:33 - 18:39]
country, our system for years, decades.

[18:37 - 18:42]
Yeah, exactly. And there's there's a lot

[18:39 - 18:44]
to do. Like to be honest, there's like a

[18:42 - 18:47]
huge amount of work to be done on all of

[18:44 - 18:49]
this. Um, and it doesn't just stop with

[18:47 - 18:51]
the impeachment removal, um, and all of

[18:49 - 18:54]
that. It it's going to continue, keep

[18:51 - 18:55]
going. Um, and you know what? Another

[18:54 - 18:57]
thing that I found in my research

[18:55 - 19:01]
recently is that conflict in moments

[18:57 - 19:03]
like these is not necessarily a terrible

[19:01 - 19:07]
thing. Um, because we're going to, we've

[19:03 - 19:09]
been kind of like smoothing it over and

[19:07 - 19:12]
saying everything is okay. um we can

[19:09 - 19:14]
work together but in reality we have a

[19:12 - 19:16]
lot of different values that people have

[19:14 - 19:18]
that are coming in conflict with each

[19:16 - 19:21]
other and we have to have a dialogue

[19:18 - 19:23]
about it. We've been we've become too

[19:21 - 19:25]
complacent with the idea of just

[19:23 - 19:27]
agreeing to disagree. we need to start

[19:25 - 19:28]
having dialogues with the people. And if

[19:27 - 19:31]
there's anything that I can particularly

[19:28 - 19:33]
say um about that is that we all need to

[19:31 - 19:36]
become more comfortable talking to each

[19:33 - 19:38]
other um and kind of feeling out these

[19:36 - 19:41]
differences and trying to understand one

[19:38 - 19:42]
another. Yeah, Alisa, I think we need to

[19:41 - 19:44]
become more comfortable being

[19:42 - 19:48]
uncomfortable.

[19:44 - 19:49]
Yes, exactly. Yes, absolutely. All

[19:48 - 19:52]
right. Well, thank you so much for

[19:49 - 19:54]
joining me today from your live protest.

[19:52 - 19:56]
I love this. This is like my favorite my

[19:54 - 19:58]
favorite thing on Lights On is to

[19:56 - 20:00]
actually just have live protests being

[19:58 - 20:03]
broadcast. So, please, as a reminder, if

[20:00 - 20:04]
you haven't already, go to that act link

[20:03 - 20:07]
that's on your screen,

[20:04 - 20:07]
secure.actblue.com/donate5051DC,

[20:10 - 20:13]
I'd love to see that tick up just by the

[20:12 - 20:15]
end of this show. If we could really

[20:13 - 20:17]
help them get the infrastructure they

[20:15 - 20:20]
need, we can pull off a really

[20:17 - 20:22]
extraordinary event on July 17th that is

[20:20 - 20:24]
so crystal clear about what we are in

[20:22 - 20:27]
solidarity for. Removal, the end of

[20:24 - 20:29]
executive overreach and restoration of

[20:27 - 20:31]
power to the people for God's sakes.

[20:29 - 20:34]
Alisa, thank you so much for joining me

[20:31 - 20:37]
and thanks much love to everybody there.

[20:34 - 20:37]
Thank you.

[20:38 - 20:43]
Yeah. So, as I mentioned, uh, this this

[20:40 - 20:46]
show, this movement has made so much

[20:43 - 20:48]
extraordinary progress. If you caught me

[20:46 - 20:51]
earlier this week, we had Representative

[20:48 - 20:53]
Al Green on after he forced that vote on

[20:51 - 20:55]
the floor of the House of

[20:53 - 20:58]
Representatives, forcing his colleagues

[20:55 - 21:00]
to take a vote on his new article of

[20:58 - 21:04]
impeachment, thee impeachment article

[21:00 - 21:07]
that that indictes Donald Trump for his

[21:04 - 21:10]
illegal declaration of war essentially

[21:07 - 21:14]
on Iran, an unconstitutional act without

[21:10 - 21:16]
the authorization of Congress. He got 79

[21:14 - 21:20]
Democrats, which is not nearly enough.

[21:16 - 21:23]
Not nearly enough, but 79 Democrats to

[21:20 - 21:24]
vote in favor of that resolution. Now,

[21:23 - 21:26]
just to put that in proper framing, I

[21:24 - 21:28]
want to reiterate something that John

[21:26 - 21:30]
Bonafas, the president of Free Speech

[21:28 - 21:32]
for People, who has been instrumental in

[21:30 - 21:34]
in

[21:32 - 21:36]
being alongside Representative Green in

[21:34 - 21:39]
this process. He said, "Think of it this

[21:36 - 21:43]
way. Before Tuesday when we had that

[21:39 - 21:45]
vote, there were four Democrats, four

[21:43 - 21:49]
Democrats who had gone on the record for

[21:45 - 21:52]
impeachment. Only four Democrats who had

[21:49 - 21:55]
vocally, I'm sorry, a few more than that

[21:52 - 21:56]
had said behind closed doors or respond

[21:55 - 21:58]
to constituents that they would, but

[21:56 - 22:00]
four had been vocal. Four had been

[21:58 - 22:03]
publicly outspoken.

[22:00 - 22:07]
Now we have 79

[22:03 - 22:09]
79 Democrats who have signed on to the

[22:07 - 22:10]
impeachment effort of Donald J. Trump,

[22:09 - 22:14]
which as we brought out on the show

[22:10 - 22:16]
earlier this week is about 20 more than

[22:14 - 22:18]
Al Green had when he initially forced a

[22:16 - 22:20]
vote in Donald Trump's first term back

[22:18 - 22:23]
in 2017. Now, I want to remind you of

[22:20 - 22:26]
this list because this you, my friends,

[22:23 - 22:28]
are having a huge impact. Your pressure

[22:26 - 22:32]
is having a huge impact on these

[22:28 - 22:34]
lawmakers. those that voted not to allow

[22:32 - 22:36]
the article to proceed, that voted to

[22:34 - 22:38]
table the motion. These are the yay

[22:36 - 22:40]
votes on the motion to table, which is

[22:38 - 22:44]
essentially equivalent to a motion to

[22:40 - 22:49]
kill. Um, these are the Democrats, the

[22:44 - 22:51]
128 Democrats that voted to table the

[22:49 - 22:54]
motion. All right, no excuse whatsoever.

[22:51 - 22:56]
I've heard some ridiculous arguments

[22:54 - 22:59]
like voting to table it is is voting to

[22:56 - 23:00]
save the resolution. That's nonsense.

[22:59 - 23:03]
That's nonsense. That what what it what

[23:00 - 23:04]
what they were stopping was uh 30

[23:03 - 23:06]
minutes or an hour, I forget the

[23:04 - 23:10]
specifics of debate that they did not

[23:06 - 23:12]
want to have. And if even if it had

[23:10 - 23:14]
proceeded and then the ultimate vote on

[23:12 - 23:16]
it failed, it could have been raised

[23:14 - 23:19]
again because of the special privilege

[23:16 - 23:21]
of rule nine, which is the rule that Al

[23:19 - 23:24]
Green used to force the vote. It is a

[23:21 - 23:26]
special privilege attached to raising

[23:24 - 23:28]
articles of impeachment in the House.

[23:26 - 23:30]
any member can bring it. Even if the

[23:28 - 23:32]
ultimate resolution failed, all he would

[23:30 - 23:35]
have had to do is refile it and they

[23:32 - 23:38]
could have voted on it again. So, no

[23:35 - 23:41]
excuse for these 128 Democrats. But as

[23:38 - 23:45]
one example, look on that list. Uh the

[23:41 - 23:48]
bottom left hand corner, I believe there

[23:45 - 23:52]
is a name there. Uh let me pop this up

[23:48 - 23:55]
here. Representative Andre Carson. Now,

[23:52 - 23:58]
Andre Carson was one of those votes to

[23:55 - 24:00]
table. And you better believe that Andre

[23:58 - 24:02]
Carson, like many of the people on that

[24:00 - 24:05]
list, were feeling intense heat and

[24:02 - 24:09]
pressure and disapproval and frankly

[24:05 - 24:10]
disgust with his vote to table Al

[24:09 - 24:13]
Green's article. And what did he do the

[24:10 - 24:15]
next day? He came out and essentially

[24:13 - 24:18]
announced that he would be a co-sponsor

[24:15 - 24:20]
of it. So, he went from a vote to table

[24:18 - 24:22]
to literally being someone who was

[24:20 - 24:25]
willing to co-sponsor Al Green's

[24:22 - 24:28]
article. That is the effect of your

[24:25 - 24:30]
pressure. Please, my friends, keep it

[24:28 - 24:32]
up. Call the Congressional Switch Board

[24:30 - 24:35]
2022

[24:32 - 24:35]
3121202243121.

[24:36 - 24:42]
Ask for any one of these representatives

[24:39 - 24:43]
who voted to table. Ask them what the

[24:42 - 24:46]
hell they're doing. As I say, peaceful

[24:43 - 24:48]
but relentless. demand that these people

[24:46 - 24:50]
uphold their oath. We have a

[24:48 - 24:53]
constitutional crisis, an allout

[24:50 - 24:56]
authoritarian coup going on. If they're

[24:53 - 24:58]
not voting to oust this man by our

[24:56 - 25:00]
constitutional means right now, what the

[24:58 - 25:01]
hell are they doing? What the hell are

[25:00 - 25:04]
they doing? I don't want to hear any

[25:01 - 25:06]
arguments about impeachment has lost its

[25:04 - 25:08]
lost its gravity or lost its weight.

[25:06 - 25:10]
This is the means, for God's sakes. This

[25:08 - 25:12]
is the means that we have to

[25:10 - 25:15]
constitutionally remove a president. If

[25:12 - 25:17]
we have this kind of assault going on on

[25:15 - 25:19]
a daily basis and you are not willing to

[25:17 - 25:21]
use the constitutional means that we

[25:19 - 25:24]
have, you're basically setting us up for

[25:21 - 25:27]
something very, very dangerous. So, it's

[25:24 - 25:29]
on you, my friends. It's on you to

[25:27 - 25:31]
uphold your oath and support impeachment

[25:29 - 25:33]
and removal of this guy and change the

[25:31 - 25:36]
narrative. And that's what the removal

[25:33 - 25:37]
coalition is all about. I'm going to

[25:36 - 25:39]
announce one more big event that's

[25:37 - 25:41]
coming up right before I bring in

[25:39 - 25:44]
Michael Embbridge who is going to join

[25:41 - 25:46]
us in just a moment. He's friend of the

[25:44 - 25:48]
removal movement. He was a speaker at

[25:46 - 25:51]
the 314 Veterans March. He's a columnist

[25:48 - 25:53]
for Rolling Stone and a former adviser

[25:51 - 25:55]
at Veterans Affairs. He's also a Navy

[25:53 - 25:56]
vet himself. So, we're going to bring

[25:55 - 25:59]
him in in just a minute, but I want to

[25:56 - 26:01]
put this one other event on your radar.

[25:59 - 26:04]
I mentioned two dates in the

[26:01 - 26:07]
description. One being July 17th. The

[26:04 - 26:12]
other big date for protest coming up is

[26:07 - 26:17]
July 4th. July 4th. If you can show up

[26:12 - 26:20]
at your local your your capital city,

[26:17 - 26:22]
your local town, have an event or see if

[26:20 - 26:24]
one is being planned in the morning of

[26:22 - 26:29]
July 4th. during the day in July 4th.

[26:24 - 26:32]
What a day to protest Donald Trump. The

[26:29 - 26:34]
man who is literally almost line by line

[26:32 - 26:36]
committing the offenses that we that

[26:34 - 26:38]
were our grievances against the king and

[26:36 - 26:41]
our declaration of independence. What

[26:38 - 26:44]
could be a more apt day to protest

[26:41 - 26:47]
Donald Trump? Uh I for one will be in

[26:44 - 26:49]
Miami, Florida. Miami, Florida, my

[26:47 - 26:51]
friends. Oh my gosh. Let me tell you,

[26:49 - 26:53]
this is quite a full circle moment for

[26:51 - 26:56]
me because the last time I was in Miami,

[26:53 - 26:58]
I was working on the 2016 Trump

[26:56 - 27:02]
campaign. Um, so this will be my first

[26:58 - 27:06]
time back to Miami since then. And I

[27:02 - 27:09]
will be joining 5051 Florida and 5051

[27:06 - 27:12]
Miami who also are part of the removal

[27:09 - 27:15]
coalition. And they have very aptly

[27:12 - 27:17]
named this reclaim freedom rally for

[27:15 - 27:19]
removal. And that's I think it's

[27:17 - 27:21]
excellent. It's excellent that that this

[27:19 - 27:23]
messaging is being put out there topline

[27:21 - 27:26]
more and more in these protests. So

[27:23 - 27:29]
here's a wonderful example from 5051

[27:26 - 27:31]
Miami. Please, if you're part of a 50-51

[27:29 - 27:34]
chapter, indivisible chapter, your own,

[27:31 - 27:35]
you know, leader of local protests or

[27:34 - 27:41]
standing on your street corner and that

[27:35 - 27:45]
red blue dot in a in a red town, uh,

[27:41 - 27:47]
set up a a rally for removal like 5051

[27:45 - 27:49]
Miami and share it with me at Jessica

[27:47 - 27:52]
Densson07 on Instagram, on Blue Sky, and

[27:49 - 27:55]
I will do everything to amplify it for

[27:52 - 27:57]
sure. Um, so anyway, I'm very happy to

[27:55 - 27:58]
be joined by my next guest. He's a

[27:57 - 28:02]
friend. We actually ran into each other

[27:58 - 28:04]
again in on D-Day in Washington DC.

[28:02 - 28:06]
Michael Embbridge. Mike, welcome back to

[28:04 - 28:07]
Lights On.

[28:06 - 28:10]
Jessica, how are you? I just got to make

[28:07 - 28:12]
an adjustment here. There you go. How

[28:10 - 28:16]
are you? Both of you from our hotel

[28:12 - 28:19]
rooms today. That is true. Yes, we are.

[28:16 - 28:21]
So, you told me uh when you came on,

[28:19 - 28:23]
we've got, of course, Donald Trump

[28:21 - 28:26]
trying to force through this heinous, I

[28:23 - 28:28]
call it bastardly, barbarous bill. It's

[28:26 - 28:31]
been called a MAGA murder bill, big ugly

[28:28 - 28:33]
bill. Uh he's doing everything he can to

[28:31 - 28:36]
push this through before Independence

[28:33 - 28:40]
Day. And you are intimately familiar

[28:36 - 28:42]
with what a disgusting assault on our

[28:40 - 28:44]
veterans and their service this bill is.

[28:42 - 28:45]
Can you just kind of give us refresh us

[28:44 - 28:48]
on some of these details? And I know

[28:45 - 28:51]
you've written about it, too.

[28:48 - 28:55]
Yeah. So, um, the big busted bill kind

[28:51 - 28:56]
of basically defunds the VA. So, the

[28:55 - 28:59]
health I mean, you need a little bit of

[28:56 - 29:01]
a backstory on this. So, the healthcare

[28:59 - 29:04]
industry really has nowhere else to grow

[29:01 - 29:06]
at this point. Um, outside of

[29:04 - 29:07]
pharmaceuticals, um, healthcare in

[29:06 - 29:09]
America is what it is and it's not

[29:07 - 29:13]
getting any bigger as far as hospitals

[29:09 - 29:15]
go. And there is one giant untapped

[29:13 - 29:17]
gold giant piece of gold and it's the

[29:15 - 29:20]
VA. It's the it's the the public VA

[29:17 - 29:21]
health care system and they are licking

[29:20 - 29:24]
their chops. All the healthcare

[29:21 - 29:26]
executives in America, all of the the

[29:24 - 29:28]
people who run for-profit hospitals,

[29:26 - 29:30]
which are most of them in this country.

[29:28 - 29:32]
Um some of them are nonprofits, but

[29:30 - 29:34]
that's just just by name. They they they

[29:32 - 29:36]
coordinate with doctors who make

[29:34 - 29:40]
profits. Um, so they they want that big

[29:36 - 29:41]
chunk of public hospital that works

[29:40 - 29:45]
really well for our veterans that can

[29:41 - 29:47]
negotiate drug prices. Um, that has no

[29:45 - 29:49]
fees. Healthcare makes their money off

[29:47 - 29:51]
of fees and there's no more fees left to

[29:49 - 29:55]
be had. The hospital fees are maxed out.

[29:51 - 29:57]
The codes are maxed out. Um, they they

[29:55 - 29:58]
really can't make much more money off of

[29:57 - 30:00]
the reason why Medicare and Medicaid

[29:58 - 30:01]
hasn't been cut in the past because the

[30:00 - 30:03]
healthcare industry is so strong. But I

[30:01 - 30:06]
think what happened behind the scenes is

[30:03 - 30:09]
they're willing to trade um cuts to

[30:06 - 30:13]
Medicaid for a privatized VA. And that's

[30:09 - 30:15]
where we're headed. Um Senator Oaf had

[30:13 - 30:17]
uh Doug Collins, who's the Secretary of

[30:15 - 30:20]
Veterans Affairs, um in front of the

[30:17 - 30:22]
Senate committee yesterday and asked him

[30:20 - 30:24]
where they're going to cut 17 billion

[30:22 - 30:26]
with what what positions are they going

[30:24 - 30:29]
to cut? And Doug Collins couldn't answer

[30:26 - 30:30]
the question. Um we know the answer.

[30:29 - 30:32]
It's nurses and doctors and mental

[30:30 - 30:33]
health professionals and everybody VA

[30:32 - 30:38]
relies on because what they want to do

[30:33 - 30:41]
is and there's a a bill in Congress um

[30:38 - 30:43]
called the Access Act um that they want

[30:41 - 30:46]
to send those veterans out to to private

[30:43 - 30:49]
providers. They want to make the VA a

[30:46 - 30:52]
private for-profit health care system

[30:49 - 30:53]
and this bill is just the beginning of

[30:52 - 30:54]
it.

[30:53 - 30:57]
Yeah, you're really talking about a

[30:54 - 30:59]
system that is just exploiting people

[30:57 - 31:02]
who are in need for profits and for

[30:59 - 31:03]
greed. And I know from the first

[31:02 - 31:05]
administration, Donald Trump's first

[31:03 - 31:07]
administration, how aggressively they

[31:05 - 31:10]
were trying to do this. Uh you talked in

[31:07 - 31:11]
this article that you wrote about uh I

[31:10 - 31:13]
think this is from May in the Rolling

[31:11 - 31:16]
Stone about veterans literally working

[31:13 - 31:19]
out of closets because of his

[31:16 - 31:21]
nonsensical war on the VA. I mean, just

[31:19 - 31:24]
talk about some of the absurd conditions

[31:21 - 31:25]
that our veterans are being put into

[31:24 - 31:27]
right now because of the Trump

[31:25 - 31:30]
administration.

[31:27 - 31:32]
Sure. So, on the on the flip side of the

[31:30 - 31:33]
big busted bills, budget cuts where

[31:32 - 31:35]
which means they won't be hiring anybody

[31:33 - 31:37]
in the future. Uh they want to make it

[31:35 - 31:39]
untenable for current VA employees who

[31:37 - 31:41]
actually help our veterans to work

[31:39 - 31:44]
there. Um, so during the Biden

[31:41 - 31:45]
administration and all throughout COVID,

[31:44 - 31:48]
um, there was a hiring preference for

[31:45 - 31:50]
remote only workers, uh, which means you

[31:48 - 31:51]
could work from home doing VA claims

[31:50 - 31:52]
right from your couch. You didn't even

[31:51 - 31:54]
have to leave. And that really sped up

[31:52 - 31:56]
the weight times because we had people

[31:54 - 31:57]
that didn't have to commute to the

[31:56 - 31:59]
office. You know, that's an hour out of

[31:57 - 32:00]
your day, get your coffee, sit down at

[31:59 - 32:02]
your desk, and start doing claims. They

[32:00 - 32:03]
could wake up at 7:30 in the morning,

[32:02 - 32:05]
shut their computer off at 7:30 at

[32:03 - 32:08]
night. And it actually was a really good

[32:05 - 32:09]
system. But Trump wants to eliminate

[32:08 - 32:11]
most of the federal government. that's

[32:09 - 32:13]
quieted down a bit because there's a

[32:11 - 32:16]
case currently in front of the Supreme

[32:13 - 32:18]
Court. Um, as we saw today, the Supreme

[32:16 - 32:20]
Court has allowed Trump to to move past

[32:18 - 32:22]
injunctions, local injunctions

[32:20 - 32:25]
from district courts. Um, so we can

[32:22 - 32:27]
expect the the the Supreme Court to rule

[32:25 - 32:28]
that Trump can get rid of most of the

[32:27 - 32:30]
federal government. So, they're going to

[32:28 - 32:32]
hire they're going to fire 82,000

[32:30 - 32:34]
employees at VA and the rest of them are

[32:32 - 32:36]
working are going to be working in

[32:34 - 32:38]
conditions that are so unsuitable that

[32:36 - 32:40]
most of them will just quit and try to

[32:38 - 32:42]
find a new job because even with the

[32:40 - 32:44]
civil service protections, it's not

[32:42 - 32:45]
worth working there in a groom closet uh

[32:44 - 32:48]
with your coworker elbow to elbow

[32:45 - 32:49]
because you got hired to work from home

[32:48 - 32:52]
and they don't have enough offices for

[32:49 - 32:54]
you to work. Um, so, so it's it's

[32:52 - 32:57]
basically a systemic dismantling of the

[32:54 - 32:58]
VA and it's happening on every single

[32:57 - 33:00]
level. And the only people who are

[32:58 - 33:02]
seeing it right now are the veterans

[33:00 - 33:03]
that get to care from the VA because the

[33:02 - 33:06]
mainstream media is not covering this at

[33:03 - 33:08]
all. And uh, members of Congress who are

[33:06 - 33:10]
actually and their staffs are actually

[33:08 - 33:12]
looking at the bill to see what the real

[33:10 - 33:14]
world impacts of this are. Um, which

[33:12 - 33:16]
which we won't know how bad this is

[33:14 - 33:18]
until the next budget cycle. Really, so

[33:16 - 33:20]
until October.

[33:18 - 33:22]
Yeah. Well, I would remind everybody,

[33:20 - 33:23]
and this is one thing that I've learned

[33:22 - 33:25]
from our friends at Citizens

[33:23 - 33:27]
Impeachment, and Gabe uh Gabe

[33:25 - 33:29]
Garberwood, a former Senate staffer

[33:27 - 33:31]
who's been on our show, one tool that

[33:29 - 33:33]
those senators, even the ones that raise

[33:31 - 33:35]
holy hell in hearings, don't use nearly

[33:33 - 33:37]
enough is objecting to unanimous

[33:35 - 33:41]
consent. Yeah, they can object to

[33:37 - 33:43]
unanimous consent to literally grind the

[33:41 - 33:45]
operations of the Senate to a halt on

[33:43 - 33:48]
most matters. One name, you may

[33:45 - 33:52]
remember, Mike, Tommy Tubberville. He

[33:48 - 33:53]
used this very tactic to stop military,

[33:52 - 33:56]
you know, flag flag officers from being

[33:53 - 33:58]
promoted under Biden for months. I mean,

[33:56 - 34:00]
was it even I feel like it was almost a

[33:58 - 34:03]
year. It was it was an in obscenely long

[34:00 - 34:05]
time. He was no, he was in the minority.

[34:03 - 34:08]
He had no special leadership. He was

[34:05 - 34:11]
just using the tools that any member of

[34:08 - 34:14]
that Senate has to grind things to a

[34:11 - 34:17]
halt. And I think one major frustration

[34:14 - 34:20]
of any of us who are seeing this assault

[34:17 - 34:22]
on democracy, this this insult to our

[34:20 - 34:24]
veterans, to our service members, is

[34:22 - 34:26]
that our legislators, even sometimes

[34:24 - 34:29]
when they talk a good game, are not

[34:26 - 34:31]
using nearly enough of the tools at

[34:29 - 34:33]
their disposal to actually do something

[34:31 - 34:35]
about it.

[34:33 - 34:37]
No, agreed. I mean, um, any one senator

[34:35 - 34:40]
can can stop a discussion dead in its

[34:37 - 34:42]
tracks, uh, by refusing, um, to consent.

[34:40 - 34:44]
I mean, that's just part of the powers

[34:42 - 34:46]
that the Senate has. The parliamentarian

[34:44 - 34:49]
um would enforce that if it if it was

[34:46 - 34:52]
done. Um I guess the thing I always say

[34:49 - 34:54]
this uh when I'm talking online, um

[34:52 - 34:56]
politics is a lot like sports. Everybody

[34:54 - 34:57]
has an opinion. Everybody thinks they

[34:56 - 34:58]
can do it better, but there's only a

[34:57 - 35:00]
handful of people that know what's going

[34:58 - 35:02]
on behind the scenes. Um so I try not to

[35:00 - 35:05]
be too hard on people for not using

[35:02 - 35:07]
unanimous consent because I think if you

[35:05 - 35:08]
if you go down that road, you could lead

[35:07 - 35:11]
to a place where the Senate just becomes

[35:08 - 35:13]
deadlocked. I think what Tubber Bill did

[35:11 - 35:14]
was reprehensible. It wasn't even for a

[35:13 - 35:16]
real issue or a real bill. It was for

[35:14 - 35:18]
woke purposes. Like I don't think

[35:16 - 35:21]
anybody's ever figured out what that is

[35:18 - 35:24]
and they probably never will. Um but um

[35:21 - 35:26]
certainly certainly much more can be

[35:24 - 35:28]
done legislatively. Uh I know you guys

[35:26 - 35:30]
were just talking about impeachment. I

[35:28 - 35:32]
mean if having a crypto party and

[35:30 - 35:34]
inviting foreign investors is not a high

[35:32 - 35:35]
crime and a misdemeanor for the

[35:34 - 35:38]
president to commit, then really nothing

[35:35 - 35:40]
is. I mean, let's be honest, if Obama or

[35:38 - 35:41]
Biden did something like that, um,

[35:40 - 35:44]
they'd be outside with pitchforks and

[35:41 - 35:45]
and torches. So, yeah. No kidding. No

[35:44 - 35:47]
kidding. And just generally, like,

[35:45 - 35:49]
remind me of your perspective of

[35:47 - 35:52]
somebody who has actually served this

[35:49 - 35:54]
country. Um, having this all come down

[35:52 - 35:56]
from a man who first of all is

[35:54 - 35:58]
disqualified. You know, this is my, you

[35:56 - 36:00]
know, this is my like baby, section

[35:58 - 36:04]
three of the 14th amendment. Okay, this

[36:00 - 36:07]
is one of our one of our OG1 14th now

[36:04 - 36:09]
members said, "I compare this to having

[36:07 - 36:12]
a president after the Civil War who was

[36:09 - 36:14]
a Confederate soldier soldier." I mean,

[36:12 - 36:15]
that's basically what we've got as

[36:14 - 36:17]
president right now with having someone

[36:15 - 36:18]
who is an insurrectionist, someone who

[36:17 - 36:20]
tried to stay in power against the will

[36:18 - 36:22]
of the people and led a violent

[36:20 - 36:24]
insurrection on our capital as

[36:22 - 36:27]
president. I mean, it's it's utterly

[36:24 - 36:29]
insane. somebody who claimed that he had

[36:27 - 36:31]
bone spurs to avoid service and never

[36:29 - 36:36]
served a day in his life and called our

[36:31 - 36:39]
has called our military wounded suckers

[36:36 - 36:41]
and losers. I th this is the man who is

[36:39 - 36:43]
doing this. Yeah. And I mean somebody

[36:41 - 36:45]
who who denies his own intelligence

[36:43 - 36:47]
agencies, someone who denies his own

[36:45 - 36:49]
generals uh advice. You know, the people

[36:47 - 36:50]
who are experts in the military who went

[36:49 - 36:52]
to West Point, the Naval Academy and

[36:50 - 36:53]
have been doing this for 30 years. I

[36:52 - 36:55]
mean, Trump said it publicly. I know

[36:53 - 36:58]
more than the generals. Um the guy has

[36:55 - 37:00]
no respect for service. He he he never

[36:58 - 37:02]
could serve. He he never would. Um you

[37:00 - 37:03]
know, his service is throwing military

[37:02 - 37:05]
parades for himself. I believe he's

[37:03 - 37:08]
quoted saying um his college years were

[37:05 - 37:09]
his own personal Vietnam. Um the guy's a

[37:08 - 37:12]
clown. I mean, we know this. He's not a

[37:09 - 37:15]
serious person. Um he's a deeply uh

[37:12 - 37:18]
mentally ill person um who just wants it

[37:15 - 37:20]
to be about him. I mean, you know, our,

[37:18 - 37:23]
you know, men and women went and and

[37:20 - 37:25]
bombed Iranian nuclear facilities, which

[37:23 - 37:27]
we, you know, we don't know what the

[37:25 - 37:29]
extent of that was. Um, but, you know,

[37:27 - 37:31]
he found a way to make it about him. You

[37:29 - 37:33]
know, um, a report comes out that said

[37:31 - 37:34]
the bombings weren't as effective as

[37:33 - 37:36]
we'd hoped. And, you know, he had to

[37:34 - 37:38]
say, "No, you know, the DoD's lying.

[37:36 - 37:39]
Whoever leaked out from the DoD is

[37:38 - 37:40]
lying. Now, there's an active search for

[37:39 - 37:42]
this person that's going to be

[37:40 - 37:43]
prosecuted." just like all the people

[37:42 - 37:45]
who are going to be prosecuted for

[37:43 - 37:46]
fraud, wasting, abuse of Doge and all

[37:45 - 37:47]
the Democrats who are going to be

[37:46 - 37:50]
prosecuted when it took over for all

[37:47 - 37:51]
their crimes. Um, it's just a non-stop

[37:50 - 37:53]
circle jerk. It really is. I mean, just

[37:51 - 37:56]
just to throw the red meat to to Maggot

[37:53 - 37:59]
Twitter and they will never ever ever

[37:56 - 38:01]
have a critical thinking brain cell in

[37:59 - 38:02]
their mind to say, "Wow, maybe I'm being

[38:01 - 38:05]
lied to. Maybe the reason there's been

[38:02 - 38:07]
no arrest and I didn't get my $5,000 do

[38:05 - 38:08]
and there hasn't been lines and lines of

[38:07 - 38:10]
politicians going to federal prison is

[38:08 - 38:11]
maybe this guy's lying to me. maybe

[38:10 - 38:15]
hasn't been telling the truth for the

[38:11 - 38:17]
past 16 years. Uh so I don't know. I

[38:15 - 38:21]
mean I I try not to get inside the mind

[38:17 - 38:24]
of of of the mega sickness. Uh but um I

[38:21 - 38:26]
mean well as I as I as I um you know

[38:24 - 38:28]
very share very transparently for the

[38:26 - 38:30]
time that I was in it and granted I

[38:28 - 38:31]
can't I can't fathom myself being in it

[38:30 - 38:34]
having seen all that we've seen in the

[38:31 - 38:37]
past eight years but when I was in it

[38:34 - 38:39]
six 2016 and prior it was the

[38:37 - 38:42]
brainwashing of Fox News. I mean, it is

[38:39 - 38:44]
genuinely a hypnotic cult being

[38:42 - 38:46]
subjected to that. And people, you know,

[38:44 - 38:47]
when you're looking for a logic there,

[38:46 - 38:50]
there just simply isn't a logic. That's

[38:47 - 38:52]
what memeism does to you. It it takes

[38:50 - 38:55]
away your ability to critically think

[38:52 - 38:57]
and and analyze things logically. It is

[38:55 - 38:59]
it is a cult and it is engaged in

[38:57 - 39:02]
hypnosis. That is the propaganda of Fox

[38:59 - 39:05]
News that hijacks symbols like you know

[39:02 - 39:08]
the cross and the American flag and the

[39:05 - 39:10]
Bible but and then utterly blasphemes

[39:08 - 39:12]
all of them on a daily basis. So it's

[39:10 - 39:14]
it's a cult. It's just basically a cult.

[39:12 - 39:16]
That's the simple answer for it. But

[39:14 - 39:18]
what I tell people all the time is

[39:16 - 39:19]
listen, we're trying to we're trying to

[39:18 - 39:21]
warn you before you have to suffer

[39:19 - 39:23]
personally because there will come a

[39:21 - 39:25]
time when you will feel it. You will

[39:23 - 39:27]
feel it directly and it's going to be

[39:25 - 39:28]
really really painful. And as much as

[39:27 - 39:30]
you may think or Donald Trump may try to

[39:28 - 39:32]
paint us out here in the resistance as

[39:30 - 39:34]
your enemies, we're actually your best

[39:32 - 39:36]
friends because we're we're trying to

[39:34 - 39:38]
save you from the suffering that we know

[39:36 - 39:40]
is eventually coming your way. Yeah. And

[39:38 - 39:42]
I mean, they only support people in the

[39:40 - 39:46]
military when when these people abide by

[39:42 - 39:48]
their political ideology. Um I mean it's

[39:46 - 39:50]
it's it's it is a cult and Fox is is

[39:48 - 39:52]
partly to to blame, but people can't get

[39:50 - 39:54]
out of the echo chamber. Like um if you

[39:52 - 39:56]
want to find a reality that suits your

[39:54 - 39:58]
beliefs, you can find it. you just go on

[39:56 - 39:59]
exit truth social, you don't have to be

[39:58 - 40:01]
bothered by pesky comments because the

[39:59 - 40:02]
algorithm will filter those out because

[40:01 - 40:04]
they know you don't like to see them.

[40:02 - 40:06]
Um, so I think the social media

[40:04 - 40:09]
companies have a huge a huge part in

[40:06 - 40:11]
this. Um, I think like if we ever get

[40:09 - 40:12]
back to a normal politics, which I am

[40:11 - 40:15]
very pessimistic about. I think those

[40:12 - 40:16]
days are over. I hope I'm wrong, but I I

[40:15 - 40:19]
don't think we'll ever go back to the

[40:16 - 40:21]
way it was under Obama um or even prior

[40:19 - 40:22]
to Hillary Clinton's campaign against

[40:21 - 40:26]
Donald Trump the first time. Um, I think

[40:22 - 40:29]
we're in a brave new world and whoever

[40:26 - 40:31]
can bark the loudest, um, I think

[40:29 - 40:34]
Zoran's a good example of this. He's

[40:31 - 40:36]
kind of the the anti-Trump. Um, he

[40:34 - 40:38]
doesn't have to do it. Zoran Manami,

[40:36 - 40:41]
he's the Oh, yes. Yeah. Absolutely.

[40:38 - 40:43]
Yeah. So, he um he just won the primary

[40:41 - 40:45]
and all he has to do is exist to feed

[40:43 - 40:46]
oxygen into the online fire from the

[40:45 - 40:48]
right. And that's what the left has been

[40:46 - 40:50]
doing to Trump the whole time. All Trump

[40:48 - 40:52]
had to do is exist. And since the days

[40:50 - 40:54]
he took out an ad in the New York Times

[40:52 - 40:56]
calling for the execution of five

[40:54 - 40:59]
innocent kids in Central Park uh for a

[40:56 - 41:01]
crime they didn't commit, um he he has

[40:59 - 41:02]
been a person who could just exist. And

[41:01 - 41:04]
I'm not saying Zoran is that guy, but

[41:02 - 41:05]
I'm saying he's the anti he's the

[41:04 - 41:07]
opposite of that. Him just being a

[41:05 - 41:10]
Muslim American, him just being a

[41:07 - 41:12]
33-year-old Democratic socialist, just

[41:10 - 41:14]
him being existing in the political

[41:12 - 41:17]
sphere is making their heads explode,

[41:14 - 41:19]
and I'm loving every minute of it.

[41:17 - 41:22]
Well, speaking loving every bit of it.

[41:19 - 41:24]
Um, when we met on D-Day, there we are

[41:22 - 41:26]
with our friends Harry Dunn and Sergeant

[41:24 - 41:29]
Akilino Gonell. So great. Two American

[41:26 - 41:31]
heroes. Yes. Yes. I I love those guys so

[41:29 - 41:33]
much. Akilino has been a friend for a

[41:31 - 41:36]
long time. And Harry spoke for us along

[41:33 - 41:38]
with you, Mike, um, back on 314.

[41:36 - 41:40]
But when we met that day in the media

[41:38 - 41:42]
tent, you were telling me about your new

[41:40 - 41:44]
podcast, which I'm very excited about.

[41:42 - 41:45]
Tell me about your Tell me about this.

[41:44 - 41:48]
Tell our audience about it.

[41:45 - 41:50]
Yeah. So, um I'm hosting uh the Wash

[41:48 - 41:52]
podcast with a good friend of mine. His

[41:50 - 41:54]
name is Leonte Gru. Um he's possibly one

[41:52 - 41:56]
of the best wide receivers that ever

[41:54 - 41:58]
played Ruckers football. He also played

[41:56 - 42:01]
for the Miami Dolphins. Uh New Jersey

[41:58 - 42:03]
guy like me. Um and I think that there's

[42:01 - 42:05]
something that has been missing um from

[42:03 - 42:07]
the leftophere or from from the echo

[42:05 - 42:10]
chamber on the left or whatever you want

[42:07 - 42:12]
to call it. Um is is just got white male

[42:10 - 42:15]
guys and black male guys just talking

[42:12 - 42:16]
about sports. Um whether we're liberal

[42:15 - 42:17]
or conservative, I think like those are

[42:16 - 42:20]
the things that people want to hear

[42:17 - 42:21]
about our stories. Um everything doesn't

[42:20 - 42:23]
have to be about politics. Like if I

[42:21 - 42:24]
wear a Gulf of Mexico shirt, it doesn't

[42:23 - 42:26]
have to be political. Let's have the

[42:24 - 42:28]
discussion about why the Gulf of Mexico

[42:26 - 42:29]
is called the Gulf of Mexico, the

[42:28 - 42:32]
history of Mexico, you know, what's

[42:29 - 42:34]
going on in Mexico now. You know, our

[42:32 - 42:36]
favorite food places in Mexico. I think

[42:34 - 42:39]
it it's more of a it's more of an effort

[42:36 - 42:42]
to reach uh a younger generation of of

[42:39 - 42:45]
men who are online and consuming media

[42:42 - 42:47]
at a rate that frankly we've never seen

[42:45 - 42:49]
um in this country. I mean, look at you,

[42:47 - 42:51]
Jessica. Your your podcast is

[42:49 - 42:54]
tremendously successful. Um you do great

[42:51 - 42:55]
numbers. You spread a great message. Um

[42:54 - 42:57]
and you're making a real impact. And I

[42:55 - 42:59]
think that's that's something that we

[42:57 - 43:01]
wanted to do. Um and I think the

[42:59 - 43:03]
demograph is something that we kind of

[43:01 - 43:04]
really need to hit as a party. Um, so

[43:03 - 43:06]
that that's what we're doing now. And if

[43:04 - 43:07]
you guys want to check it out, if you

[43:06 - 43:09]
want to talk, it's it's pretty sports

[43:07 - 43:12]
heavy and we do talk about some

[43:09 - 43:15]
politics. So go check it out. I love

[43:12 - 43:16]
that. I love that. You know, I've um

[43:15 - 43:18]
it's by the way, I've got it up on the

[43:16 - 43:20]
screen on YouTube. Washed Pod. It's

[43:18 - 43:22]

[43:29 - 43:33]
sports with a good sports movie. Give me

[43:30 - 43:35]
a good sports movie. I love any sport.

[43:33 - 43:36]
Yeah. And I mean we we we talk about

[43:35 - 43:39]
like I mean we talk about everything

[43:36 - 43:40]
from like 90Day Fiance to I mean it's

[43:39 - 43:42]
really just two dudes like kicking it in

[43:40 - 43:43]
the bar until the football season

[43:42 - 43:44]
starts, you know. I mean that's

[43:43 - 43:47]
basically what it is. It's not really

[43:44 - 43:48]
sports heavy. Um it's a real it's a real

[43:47 - 43:50]
fluff show. I mean it's I mean we do

[43:48 - 43:52]
talk about serious issues that you talk

[43:50 - 43:53]
about veterans getting deported and you

[43:52 - 43:55]
know all the kind of serious stuff that

[43:53 - 43:57]
you cover on this show. Um but we we

[43:55 - 43:59]
really do try to keep it light and

[43:57 - 44:01]
informational and fun. Um so you know

[43:59 - 44:02]
it's it's kind of a hybrid. It's coming

[44:01 - 44:04]
together. Um, we're doing pretty well.

[44:02 - 44:05]
Um, it's hit and miss. You know, the

[44:04 - 44:07]
YouTube algorithm is really hard to

[44:05 - 44:09]
crack, but uh, we're there. Um, and

[44:07 - 44:10]
well, we're gonna get you we're going to

[44:09 - 44:12]
get you a decent number of new

[44:10 - 44:15]
subscribers today, everybody. Wash at

[44:12 - 44:17]
washed pod. Go subscribe right now. What

[44:15 - 44:18]
I was saying is like, yeah, absolutely.

[44:17 - 44:21]
Like, give me a good conversation. Just

[44:18 - 44:23]
something uplifting. You know, I I I go

[44:21 - 44:24]
home at night and I turn on like a late

[44:23 - 44:26]
night show or something because you need

[44:24 - 44:29]
you need a release from this. you need a

[44:26 - 44:31]
release and you need to to approach it

[44:29 - 44:33]
with, you know, with humor. And I love

[44:31 - 44:35]
the angle like I always I'm always

[44:33 - 44:37]
thinking about this and my my audience

[44:35 - 44:39]
knows like this is not my chosen

[44:37 - 44:42]
profession like podcast. No. Yeah. Yeah.

[44:39 - 44:44]
Right. Yeah. This is not what I want to

[44:42 - 44:46]
do. I'm an artist. I would love more

[44:44 - 44:48]
than anything to be, you know, just

[44:46 - 44:52]
making art all the time. And I think we

[44:48 - 44:54]
really need people in other fields to be

[44:52 - 44:56]
drawing attention to these matters. We

[44:54 - 44:59]
have to reach people that are not

[44:56 - 45:00]
plugged into politics 247.

[44:59 - 45:03]
And I mean, and politics is becoming a

[45:00 - 45:05]
team sport. It really is. And I mean, we

[45:03 - 45:06]
can give you no better information than

[45:05 - 45:08]
why you should root for the team of

[45:06 - 45:10]
freedom, the freedom, the team of

[45:08 - 45:13]
democracy, the team of the constitution,

[45:10 - 45:14]
uh the team of personal liberty, um the

[45:13 - 45:16]
the team of politics that actually helps

[45:14 - 45:19]
people and doesn't enrich one person.

[45:16 - 45:20]
Um, but you know, it is good to tune out

[45:19 - 45:22]
sometimes and I do really enjoy doing

[45:20 - 45:24]
the show much more than than I than I

[45:22 - 45:27]
do, you know, fighting against the the

[45:24 - 45:29]
fascist right. So nice. Yeah, I

[45:27 - 45:31]
understand. Well, when you do have time

[45:29 - 45:32]
to fight for the fascist right, do you

[45:31 - 45:34]
have any plans to be on the streets on

[45:32 - 45:36]
July 4th or July 17th going to any

[45:34 - 45:38]
protests? Yeah, I think we have some

[45:36 - 45:40]
local stuff going on uh in New Jersey

[45:38 - 45:42]
that I'll be at. I don't have any plans

[45:40 - 45:44]
on Fourth of July, so I'll certainly get

[45:42 - 45:46]
Okay. All right. Nice. All right, Mike.

[45:44 - 45:48]
Well, thank you so much for joining me

[45:46 - 45:50]
again today. Really enjoy your pieces in

[45:48 - 45:52]
Rolling Stone. And uh I'm I'm going to

[45:50 - 45:55]
be a new listener to the Wash Pod. So,

[45:52 - 45:57]
you've got one non-sports fan already

[45:55 - 45:59]
subscribed. Well, we talked about Love

[45:57 - 46:01]
Island uh on last week's show. So, if

[45:59 - 46:03]
you're into that, you know, you can you

[46:01 - 46:04]
can uh get a bowl of popcorn and chill.

[46:03 - 46:06]
I'm a stranger. Like, I don't like I

[46:04 - 46:08]
don't like reality shows either, but I

[46:06 - 46:11]
do like good conversations and I can be

[46:08 - 46:13]
made to appreciate anything just by

[46:11 - 46:15]
interesting people talking about it. So,

[46:13 - 46:17]
I'm going to listen to you guys. Just

[46:15 - 46:19]
decompress. Have a tub of ice cream and

just relax. Yes, I will do that. I will

[46:19 - 46:23]
do that for sure. All right, Mike. So,

[46:21 - 46:24]
good to see you again. Take care, my

[46:23 - 46:27]
friend. You, too, Jessica. Have a great

[46:24 - 46:29]
day. Thank you. Take care.

[46:27 - 46:31]
All right. Well, thank you everybody so

[46:29 - 46:34]
much for joining me and Michael and

[46:31 - 46:36]
Alisa tonight. Really great show. I want

[46:34 - 46:38]
to just remind you about those two major

[46:36 - 46:41]
events coming up if you didn't get them

[46:38 - 46:44]
already ready. One is July 17th. This is

[46:41 - 46:47]
the further out one. July 17th in

[46:44 - 46:48]
Washington DC. This is the good trouble

[46:47 - 46:51]
day. This is going to be a major march

[46:48 - 46:54]
on Washington with a very explicit

[46:51 - 46:56]
message about removal. 50-51 DC is doing

[46:54 - 46:58]
this in coalition with 14th now and the

[46:56 - 47:00]
removal coalition and a number of other

[46:58 - 47:02]
amazing organizations that are getting

[47:00 - 47:03]
on board right now. I want to read you

[47:02 - 47:06]
that quote that's up on the screen from

[47:03 - 47:09]
John Lewis. says a democracy cannot

[47:06 - 47:11]
thrive where power where power remains

[47:09 - 47:14]
unchecked and justice is reserved for a

[47:11 - 47:18]
select few. Ignoring these cries and

[47:14 - 47:21]
falling failing to respond to move to

[47:18 - 47:24]
take movement is simply not an option

[47:21 - 47:28]
for peace cannot exist where justice is

[47:24 - 47:30]
not served. God bless John Lewis. God

[47:28 - 47:32]
bless that dear man who put everything

[47:30 - 47:34]
on the line to fight for justice and

[47:32 - 47:37]
equality and freedom. If you want to

[47:34 - 47:39]
support 50-51, help them get the actual

[47:37 - 47:41]
physical infrastructure we need to pull

[47:39 - 47:42]

[47:47 - 47:53]
Now, the second event, more recent, more

[47:50 - 47:57]
more uh coming up more in just a week

[47:53 - 47:59]
from today, July 4th, is protests

[47:57 - 48:02]
everywhere around this country. go to

[47:59 - 48:04]
your your state capital, throw one

[48:02 - 48:07]
yourself during the day on July 4th. I

[48:04 - 48:10]
would strongly strongly suggest you call

[48:07 - 48:13]
it a re rally for removal like 5051

[48:10 - 48:16]
Miami is. I will be there with 5051

[48:13 - 48:18]
Miami with with Carlos Alvarez Saranos

[48:16 - 48:20]
who's my good friend who we've been on

[48:18 - 48:23]
kind of unintentionally on the road

[48:20 - 48:24]
together with these protests. Um we'll

[48:23 - 48:28]
be having a really great event there.

[48:24 - 48:31]
Also, Sergeant Rhodess, who's a popular

[48:28 - 48:33]
um popular anti-Trump uh figure on

[48:31 - 48:35]
social media, and Phil, retired Navy

[48:33 - 48:37]
commander who's running for Congress

[48:35 - 48:39]
down there in Florida in a very red

[48:37 - 48:40]
district, but making a lot of gains and

[48:39 - 48:43]
a lot of gains with his pack, the

[48:40 - 48:45]
Airpack. So, if you can join us in Miami

[48:43 - 48:48]
on July 4th, it's going to be a great

[48:45 - 48:51]
time. And and if you're not in Miami, go

[48:48 - 48:53]
to your local town and and have a rally

[48:51 - 48:55]

removed from office. All right,

I voted a straight Republican ticket my entire life until Trump. Im approaching 60 and a veteran. I'm now a Democrat and will never vote Republican again. The Supreme court no longer has integrity nor ethics. I fully support Lights On!

> **@nolltk** (üëç 26): I am similar to you.  I always voted Republican until trump.  I used to listen to Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin.  My eyes are so open now.  I can clearly see the nut balls that they are (or were, as Rush has died).  I am a proud Democrat now and like you will never vote Republican again.  For most of my life, they have been the anti-American, anti-democracy party but I just could not see it back then.  I hope more people like us are switching parties.

We have HUNDREDS! So the Republican party should be split up in 3-4 parties and of course the Democrats too. PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS! NOT JUST TWO! :)
So you CAN stay a Republican! Just make sure it's the the "right" one! :)

Regardless of what they said back in the 60's, 70's 80's 90; etc. that sounded pro democracy, it was phony.  Now that they got trump they are full throttle.

Plus one party with a majority in both houses. All the makings of a dictatorship. It was there for those with eyes to SEE.
