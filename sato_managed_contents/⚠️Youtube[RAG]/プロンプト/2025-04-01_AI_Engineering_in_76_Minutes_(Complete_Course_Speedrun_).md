[00:00 - 00:04]
hey everyone today we're diving into the

[00:01 - 00:06]
book AI engineering by chip win 800

[00:04 - 00:08]
pages of really great content about this

[00:06 - 00:10]
in demand field that's offering salaries

[00:08 - 00:12]
of $300,000 or more in this video I'm

[00:10 - 00:13]
summarizing everything from the book to

[00:12 - 00:16]
help you get a highle overview of the

[00:13 - 00:18]
field we'll talk about Foundation models

[00:16 - 00:20]
prompt engineering rag fine tuning

[00:18 - 00:21]
agents how to build a system improving

[00:20 - 00:23]
inference and more I also want to

[00:21 - 00:25]
mention this is a super highlevel

[00:23 - 00:27]
overview of a very detailed technical

[00:25 - 00:29]
book don't expect to learn all the

[00:27 - 00:30]
details just from watching this video I

[00:29 - 00:32]
really recommend using this is a way to

[00:30 - 00:33]
get an overview of what the field looks

[00:32 - 00:36]
like and use it as a jumping off point

[00:33 - 00:38]
for your own research and exploration so

[00:36 - 00:39]
what exactly is AI engineering and how

[00:38 - 00:41]
is it different from traditional machine

[00:39 - 00:43]
learning let's break it down AI

[00:41 - 00:45]
engineering has exploded recently for

[00:43 - 00:47]
two simple reasons AI models have gotten

[00:45 - 00:49]
dramatically better at solving real

[00:47 - 00:51]
problems while the barrier to building

[00:49 - 00:52]
with them has gotten much lower this

[00:51 - 00:54]
perfect storm has created one of the

[00:52 - 00:56]
fastest growing engineering disciplines

[00:54 - 00:58]
today at its core AI engineering is

[00:56 - 01:00]
about building applications on top of

[00:58 - 01:02]
foundation models those massive AI

[01:00 - 01:04]
systems trained by companies like open

[01:02 - 01:06]
AI or Google unlike traditional machine

[01:04 - 01:08]
learning Engineers who build models from

[01:06 - 01:10]
scratch AI Engineers leverage existing

[01:08 - 01:12]
ones focusing Less on training and more

[01:10 - 01:14]
on adaptation these Foundation models

[01:12 - 01:15]
work through a process called

[01:14 - 01:18]
self-supervision instead of requiring

[01:15 - 01:19]
humans to painstakingly label data these

[01:18 - 01:21]
models can learn by predicting parts of

[01:19 - 01:23]
their input data this breakthrough

[01:21 - 01:25]
solved the data labeling bottleneck that

[01:23 - 01:27]
held back AI for years as these models

[01:25 - 01:28]
scaled up with more data and computing

[01:27 - 01:30]
power they evolved from simple language

[01:28 - 01:32]
models to what we now call large

[01:30 - 01:34]
language models or llms and they didn't

[01:32 - 01:35]
stop there they've expanded to handle

[01:34 - 01:37]
multiple types of data including images

[01:35 - 01:39]
and video often becoming large

[01:37 - 01:41]
multimodal models nowadays we're seeing

[01:39 - 01:43]
Foundation models power everything from

[01:41 - 01:45]
coding assistance like GitHub co-pilot

[01:43 - 01:47]
to image generation tools writing AIDS

[01:45 - 01:49]
customer support Bots and sophisticated

[01:47 - 01:51]
data analysis systems now that we've

[01:49 - 01:53]
covered what AI engineering is let's dig

[01:51 - 01:55]
deeper into Foundation models themselves

[01:53 - 01:56]
how they're trained how they work and

[01:55 - 01:58]
why understanding their architecture

[01:56 - 02:00]
matters for AI Engineers Foundation

[01:58 - 02:02]
models at their core can only know what

[02:00 - 02:04]
they've been trained on this might seem

[02:02 - 02:06]
obvious but it has profound implications

[02:04 - 02:07]
if a model hasn't seen examples of a

[02:06 - 02:09]
specific language or concept during

[02:07 - 02:10]
training it simply won't have that

[02:09 - 02:12]
knowledge most large Foundation models

[02:10 - 02:14]
are trained on web crawled data which

[02:12 - 02:16]
brings some inherent problems this data

[02:14 - 02:19]
often contains clickbait misinformation

[02:16 - 02:20]
toxic content and fake news to combat

[02:19 - 02:23]
this teams use various filtering

[02:20 - 02:24]
techniques for instance open AI only

[02:23 - 02:27]
used Reddit links with at least three

[02:24 - 02:29]
upvotes when training gpt2 the language

[02:27 - 02:31]
distribution in training data is also

[02:29 - 02:33]
heavily skewed about half of all crawled

[02:31 - 02:34]
data is in English which means languages

[02:33 - 02:36]
with millions of speakers are often

[02:34 - 02:38]
underrepresented this is why specialized

[02:36 - 02:39]
models for specific languages and

[02:38 - 02:41]
domains are becoming increasingly

[02:39 - 02:43]
important also the distribution of

[02:41 - 02:45]
domains in one of the main training data

[02:43 - 02:46]
sets leans heavily towards business Tech

[02:45 - 02:48]
news and art in terms of model

[02:46 - 02:50]
architecture most Foundation models use

[02:48 - 02:52]
Transformer architectures based on the

[02:50 - 02:53]
attention mechanism but to understand

[02:52 - 02:54]
why Transformers were such a

[02:53 - 02:56]
breakthrough we need to look at what

[02:54 - 02:58]
came before Transformers were invented

[02:56 - 03:00]
to solve the problems of sequence to

[02:58 - 03:01]
sequence models which used current

[03:00 - 03:03]
neural networks for tasks like

[03:01 - 03:05]
translation these had two main

[03:03 - 03:07]
components an encoder that processes

[03:05 - 03:10]
inputs and a decoder that generates

[03:07 - 03:12]
outputs both worked sequentially token

[03:10 - 03:14]
by token the problem is that the decoder

[03:12 - 03:16]
only has access to a compressed

[03:14 - 03:17]
representation of the entire input

[03:16 - 03:19]
imagine trying to answer detailed

[03:17 - 03:21]
questions about a book when all you have

[03:19 - 03:23]
is a brief summary also input processing

[03:21 - 03:24]
and output generation are done

[03:23 - 03:27]
sequentially so it's slow for long

[03:24 - 03:29]
sequences Transformers solved this with

[03:27 - 03:30]
the attention mechanism which allows the

[03:29 - 03:32]
model to waigh the importance of

[03:30 - 03:34]
different input tokens when generating

[03:32 - 03:36]
each output token it's like being able

[03:34 - 03:38]
to reference any page in the book while

[03:36 - 03:40]
answering questions plus Transformers

[03:38 - 03:41]
can process input tokens in parallel

[03:40 - 03:44]
making them much faster during inference

[03:41 - 03:46]
Transformers work in two steps first

[03:44 - 03:48]
pre-fill process all the input tokens in

[03:46 - 03:51]
parallel to create the intermediate

[03:48 - 03:52]
State and second decode generate one

[03:51 - 03:55]
output token at a time the attention

[03:52 - 03:58]
mechanism uses three types of vectors

[03:55 - 04:00]
first query vectors these represent what

[03:58 - 04:02]
information the model is looking for

[04:00 - 04:04]
next key vectors like indices of

[04:02 - 04:06]
previous tokens and finally value

[04:04 - 04:08]
vectors the actual content of the

[04:06 - 04:10]
previous tokens the model computes how

[04:08 - 04:13]
much attention to give each input token

[04:10 - 04:15]
by comparing the Q and K vectors A high

[04:13 - 04:17]
similarity score means that the tokens

[04:15 - 04:20]
content V will heavily influence the

[04:17 - 04:22]
output this is why longer context

[04:20 - 04:24]
windows are computationally expensive

[04:22 - 04:26]
more tokens mean more K and V vectors to

[04:24 - 04:28]
compute and store attention is almost

[04:26 - 04:30]
always multi-headed allowing the model

[04:28 - 04:33]
to focus on different groups of tokens

[04:30 - 04:34]
simultaneously in llama 27b there are 32

[04:33 - 04:36]
attention heads for example a complete

[04:34 - 04:38]
Transformer consists of multiple

[04:36 - 04:40]
Transformer blocks each containing an

[04:38 - 04:42]
attention module and a neural network

[04:40 - 04:44]
module the number of blocks is often

[04:42 - 04:45]
called the number of layers before and

[04:44 - 04:47]
after each block there's an embedding

[04:45 - 04:49]
module that converts tokens and their

[04:47 - 04:51]
positions into vectors and finally an

[04:49 - 04:53]
unembedded layer that Maps output

[04:51 - 04:55]
vectors to token probabilities so that's

[04:53 - 04:57]
a super high look at this I would really

[04:55 - 04:58]
recommend either reading the book or

[04:57 - 04:59]
check out stat quest for an awesome

[04:58 - 05:01]
overview of Transformers and the

[04:59 - 05:02]
attention mechanism I'll link that in

[05:01 - 05:03]
the description that's really how I

[05:02 - 05:05]
learned while Transformers dominate

[05:03 - 05:08]
they're not the only architecture models

[05:05 - 05:09]
like RW KV which combines RNN based

[05:08 - 05:11]
approaches with parallelization

[05:09 - 05:13]
capabilities are gaining traction for

[05:11 - 05:14]
certain applications in general larger

[05:13 - 05:16]
models with more parameters have greater

[05:14 - 05:18]
capacity to learn and perform better the

[05:16 - 05:19]
number of parameters helps us estimate

[05:18 - 05:21]
the compute resources needed for

[05:19 - 05:22]
training and inference as well however

[05:21 - 05:24]
note the parameter count can be

[05:22 - 05:26]
misleading with sparse models so those

[05:24 - 05:28]
with many zeros which can be more

[05:26 - 05:30]
efficient a large sparse model might

[05:28 - 05:32]
require less compute than a smaller

[05:30 - 05:34]
dense one when designing models compute

[05:32 - 05:35]
is often the limiting factor the

[05:34 - 05:38]
chinchilla scaling law helps calculate

[05:35 - 05:40]
the optimal model size and data size for

[05:38 - 05:41]
a given compute budget it suggests that

[05:40 - 05:43]
the number of training tokens should be

[05:41 - 05:45]
about 20 times the model size so a 3

[05:43 - 05:47]
billion parameter model needs about 60

[05:45 - 05:49]
billion training tokens while the cost

[05:47 - 05:51]
for achieving the same model performance

[05:49 - 05:53]
is decreasing over time the cost for

[05:51 - 05:55]
improvements remains High going from a

[05:53 - 05:58]
3% to a 2% error rate might require an

[05:55 - 06:00]
order of magnitude more data compute or

[05:58 - 06:01]
energy but even small performance

[06:00 - 06:03]
improvements can make a huge difference

[06:01 - 06:05]
for Downstream applications as we keep

[06:03 - 06:07]
scaling models we're approaching two

[06:05 - 06:09]
significant bottlenecks first training

[06:07 - 06:11]
data their's concern will run out of

[06:09 - 06:13]
highquality internet data in the next

[06:11 - 06:15]
few years forcing models to train on AI

[06:13 - 06:17]
generated content potentially causing

[06:15 - 06:19]
performance degradation or requiring

[06:17 - 06:21]
access to proprietary data like

[06:19 - 06:23]
copyrighted books and medical records

[06:21 - 06:25]
second electricity data centers already

[06:23 - 06:27]
consume 1 to 2% of global electricity

[06:25 - 06:29]
limiting how much larger they can grow

[06:27 - 06:31]
without significant energy breakthroughs

[06:29 - 06:33]
pre-trained Foundation models face two

[06:31 - 06:35]
main issues they're optimized for text

[06:33 - 06:37]
completion not conversation and their

[06:35 - 06:39]
outputs can be factually incorrect or

[06:37 - 06:41]
ethically problematic posttraining aims

[06:39 - 06:43]
to address these issues through two main

[06:41 - 06:45]
steps first supervised fine tuning

[06:43 - 06:47]
supervised fine tuning optimizes the

[06:45 - 06:49]
model for conversations instead of

[06:47 - 06:51]
completion this requires high quality

[06:49 - 06:52]
instruction data showing the kinds of

[06:51 - 06:54]
requests the model should handle and how

[06:52 - 06:56]
it should respond it's essentially

[06:54 - 06:58]
teaching the model what good responses

[06:56 - 07:00]
look like second preference fine tuning

[06:58 - 07:02]
preference fine tuning aligns the model

[07:00 - 07:03]
with human values using reinforcement

[07:02 - 07:05]
learning often called reinforcement

[07:03 - 07:07]
learning from Human feedback this

[07:05 - 07:08]
involves training a reward model that

[07:07 - 07:10]
scores outputs based on human

[07:08 - 07:12]
preferences and optimizing the

[07:10 - 07:14]
foundation model to generate responses

[07:12 - 07:15]
that maximize these scores while

[07:14 - 07:17]
reinforcement learning from Human

[07:15 - 07:19]
feedback has been the standard approach

[07:17 - 07:22]
newer methods like direct preference

[07:19 - 07:23]
optimization DPO are gaining traction

[07:22 - 07:25]
some companies even skip the

[07:23 - 07:27]
reinforcement learning step entirely

[07:25 - 07:28]
instead generating multiple outputs and

[07:27 - 07:30]
selecting those with high reward model

[07:28 - 07:32]
scores this is a strategy called best of

[07:30 - 07:35]
end Foundation models don't just produce

[07:32 - 07:37]
a single definitive answer they generate

[07:35 - 07:39]
probabilities for possible outputs how

[07:37 - 07:40]
we sample from these probabilities

[07:39 - 07:42]
dramatically affects the model's

[07:40 - 07:44]
responses the simplest approach is

[07:42 - 07:46]
greedy sampling always picking the

[07:44 - 07:48]
highest probability token but this leads

[07:46 - 07:50]
to repetitive predictable text to

[07:48 - 07:52]
introduce creativity we use sampling

[07:50 - 07:53]
techniques temperature controls how

[07:52 - 07:55]
confident the model is in its

[07:53 - 07:58]
predictions higher temperature values

[07:55 - 08:00]
like 0.7 to 1 make outputs more creative

[07:58 - 08:02]
but potentially less accurate while

[08:00 - 08:04]
lower temperatures close to zero make

[08:02 - 08:06]
outputs more deterministic and focused

[08:04 - 08:08]
top K sampling restricts the model to

[08:06 - 08:11]
choosing from only the K most likely

[08:08 - 08:13]
next tokens typically between 50 and 500

[08:11 - 08:15]
depending on how diverse you want the

[08:13 - 08:17]
responses to be top P sampling selects

[08:15 - 08:19]
the smallest set of tokens whose

[08:17 - 08:22]
cumulative probability exceeds a

[08:19 - 08:23]
threshold p a value of 0.9 means the

[08:22 - 08:26]
model will only consider tokens that

[08:23 - 08:28]
together make up 90% of the probability

[08:26 - 08:30]
Mass this probalistic nature explains

[08:28 - 08:32]
many of the behaviors we in Foundation

[08:30 - 08:34]
models like inconsistency with minor

[08:32 - 08:36]
input changes and hallucinations where

[08:34 - 08:37]
models confidently State incorrect

[08:36 - 08:39]
information now that we understand

[08:37 - 08:40]
Foundation models a little more let's

[08:39 - 08:42]
talk about one of the most crucial yet

[08:40 - 08:44]
underappreciated aspects of AI

[08:42 - 08:46]
engineering evaluation for some

[08:44 - 08:48]
applications figuring out evaluation can

[08:46 - 08:50]
consume the majority of your development

[08:48 - 08:52]
effort it's how you mitigate risks

[08:50 - 08:53]
uncover opportunities and gain

[08:52 - 08:55]
visibility into where your system is

[08:53 - 08:57]
failing evaluating AI systems is

[08:55 - 08:59]
significantly harder than traditional ml

[08:57 - 09:01]
models for several reasons first the

[08:59 - 09:03]
problems these models solve are often

[09:01 - 09:05]
inherently complex evaluating a

[09:03 - 09:07]
mathematical proof or the quality of a

[09:05 - 09:09]
summary requires deep expertise you

[09:07 - 09:11]
might need to read an entire book just

[09:09 - 09:13]
to judge if a summary captures the key

[09:11 - 09:15]
points correctly second tasks are

[09:13 - 09:17]
typically open-ended with many possible

[09:15 - 09:18]
correct responses unlike classification

[09:17 - 09:20]
where there's one right answer a

[09:18 - 09:23]
question like write me a poem about

[09:20 - 09:25]
resilience has countless valid responses

[09:23 - 09:27]
third Foundation models are black boxes

[09:25 - 09:29]
you can only evaluate them by observing

[09:27 - 09:31]
their outputs not by understanding their

[09:29 - 09:33]
internal workings fourth publicly

[09:31 - 09:35]
available evaluation benchmarks quickly

[09:33 - 09:38]
become saturated which is when the model

[09:35 - 09:40]
achieves perfect scores what was a

[09:38 - 09:42]
challenging test yesterday becomes an

[09:40 - 09:44]
easy exercise today and finally for

[09:42 - 09:46]
general purpose models you need to

[09:44 - 09:47]
evaluate not just known tasks but

[09:46 - 09:49]
discover new capabilities that might

[09:47 - 09:50]
extend beyond human abilities all of

[09:49 - 09:52]
this is made worse by a general

[09:50 - 09:54]
underinvestment in evaluation compared

[09:52 - 09:55]
to model development so let's start with

[09:54 - 09:57]
some fundamental metrics used to

[09:55 - 09:59]
evaluate language models during training

[09:57 - 10:01]
most autor regressive language models

[09:59 - 10:02]
are trained using cross entropy or its

[10:01 - 10:04]
relative perplexity these metrics

[10:02 - 10:06]
essentially measure how well the model

[10:04 - 10:08]
predicts the next token in a sequence

[10:06 - 10:10]
entropy measures how much information on

[10:08 - 10:12]
average a token carries the higher the

[10:10 - 10:14]
entropy the more information dense each

[10:12 - 10:15]
token is and the more unpredictable the

[10:14 - 10:17]
language if you can perfectly predict

[10:15 - 10:19]
what I'll say next what I say carries no

[10:17 - 10:21]
new information language models learn

[10:19 - 10:23]
the distribution of their training data

[10:21 - 10:24]
the better a model learns this

[10:23 - 10:26]
distribution the better it becomes at

[10:24 - 10:28]
predicting what comes next resulting in

[10:26 - 10:30]
lower cross entropy a perfectly trained

[10:28 - 10:31]
model would would achieve cross entropy

[10:30 - 10:34]
equal to the entropy of the training

[10:31 - 10:36]
data itself and the KL Divergence

[10:34 - 10:37]
between the two will be zero perplexity

[10:36 - 10:39]
is simply the exponential of cross

[10:37 - 10:41]
entropy it measures the amount of

[10:39 - 10:44]
uncertainty a model has when predicting

[10:41 - 10:45]
the next token higher perplexity means

[10:44 - 10:47]
that there are more possible options the

[10:45 - 10:50]
model is considering what counts as good

[10:47 - 10:52]
perplexity depends entirely on the data

[10:50 - 10:54]
more structured data has lower expected

[10:52 - 10:56]
perplexity because it's more predictable

[10:54 - 10:57]
the larger the vocabulary the higher the

[10:56 - 10:59]
perplexity because there are more

[10:57 - 11:01]
possible options and the long longer the

[10:59 - 11:03]
context length the lower the perplexity

[11:01 - 11:05]
tends to be while perplexity is useful

[11:03 - 11:07]
for guiding training and serves as a

[11:05 - 11:09]
proxy for a model's General capabilities

[11:07 - 11:10]
it becomes less reliable for models that

[11:09 - 11:14]
have undergone significant posttraining

[11:10 - 11:16]
with sft or rhf as models get better at

[11:14 - 11:17]
completing tasks they might actually get

[11:16 - 11:19]
worse at predicting the next token in a

[11:17 - 11:21]
statistical sense perplexity can also be

[11:19 - 11:22]
used to detect if a text was in a

[11:21 - 11:24]
model's training data because it would

[11:22 - 11:26]
be unusually good at predicting those

[11:24 - 11:28]
tokens and to identify nonsensical text

[11:26 - 11:30]
which would have abnormally High

[11:28 - 11:32]
perplexity for some tasks we can perform

[11:30 - 11:34]
exact evaluation where there's no

[11:32 - 11:36]
ambiguity about the correct answer like

[11:34 - 11:38]
multiple choice questions this is in

[11:36 - 11:40]
contrast to subjective evaluation like

[11:38 - 11:42]
grading an essay the gold standard here

[11:40 - 11:44]
is functional correctness evaluating

[11:42 - 11:46]
whether the system performs its intended

[11:44 - 11:48]
functionality for example if I ask a

[11:46 - 11:49]
model to book a restaurant reservation

[11:48 - 11:51]
did it make the correct reservation this

[11:49 - 11:52]
is the ultimate metric for any

[11:51 - 11:54]
application though it's not always clear

[11:52 - 11:56]
how to measure it in coding tasks

[11:54 - 11:58]
functional correctness translates to

[11:56 - 12:01]
execution accuracy does the code run and

[11:58 - 12:02]
produce the expected output for gaming

[12:01 - 12:04]
Bots we can measure objective

[12:02 - 12:05]
performance metrics like win rates when

[12:04 - 12:07]
reference data is available we can

[12:05 - 12:09]
evaluate outputs by comparing their

[12:07 - 12:10]
similarity to this ground truth this

[12:09 - 12:12]
approach is bottlenecked by how much and

[12:10 - 12:15]
how fast reference data can be generated

[12:12 - 12:16]
either by humans or AI there are three

[12:15 - 12:19]
main ways to compare outputs to

[12:16 - 12:21]
references first exact match a binary

[12:19 - 12:23]
measure that works for simple questions

[12:21 - 12:24]
with definitive answers like who was the

[12:23 - 12:27]
first woman to win the Nobel Prize

[12:24 - 12:29]
second lexical similarity a continuous

[12:27 - 12:31]
measure of how much the tokens over

[12:29 - 12:32]
overlap between the output and reference

[12:31 - 12:34]
this can use techniques like edit

[12:32 - 12:36]
distance how many changes are needed to

[12:34 - 12:38]
transform one text into another or

[12:36 - 12:40]
engram overlap metrics like blue and

[12:38 - 12:43]
Rouge the drawback is that you need a

[12:40 - 12:45]
comprehensive set of reference responses

[12:43 - 12:47]
and the references themselves can be

[12:45 - 12:48]
wrong plus higher lexical similarity

[12:47 - 12:50]
doesn't necessarily mean a better

[12:48 - 12:53]
response there are many ways to express

[12:50 - 12:54]
the same idea third semantic similarity

[12:53 - 12:56]
this is a continuous measure of whether

[12:54 - 12:59]
two texts have the same meaning

[12:56 - 13:00]
regardless of the specific words used

[12:59 - 13:02]
this is typically implemented by

[13:00 - 13:04]
comparing text embeddings using metrics

[13:02 - 13:06]
like cosine similarity the advantage is

[13:04 - 13:07]
that it doesn't require references but

[13:06 - 13:09]
it does depend on the quality of the

[13:07 - 13:11]
underlying embedding algorithm one of

[13:09 - 13:13]
the most powerful and common methods for

[13:11 - 13:15]
evaluating AI models in production is

[13:13 - 13:18]
using another AI model as a judge these

[13:15 - 13:19]
AI judges are fast easy to use and

[13:18 - 13:21]
relatively cheap compared to human

[13:19 - 13:23]
evaluators they can work without

[13:21 - 13:25]
reference data and can judge attributes

[13:23 - 13:26]
like correctness toxicity hallucinations

[13:25 - 13:28]
and more Studies have shown that AI

[13:26 - 13:30]
judges can correlate strongly with human

[13:28 - 13:32]
evaluators sometimes showing higher

[13:30 - 13:34]
agreement than between different human

[13:32 - 13:36]
judges they can also explain their

[13:34 - 13:38]
decisions which helps with transparency

[13:36 - 13:40]
you can use AI judges to score outputs

[13:38 - 13:42]
compare outputs to references or pick

[13:40 - 13:44]
the best of two responses since language

[13:42 - 13:46]
models are generally better with text

[13:44 - 13:47]
than numbers AI judges tend to perform

[13:46 - 13:49]
better with classification tasks than

[13:47 - 13:51]
numerical scoring when creating prompts

[13:49 - 13:53]
for AI judges you need to include the

[13:51 - 13:56]
evaluation task criteria and scoring

[13:53 - 13:58]
system few shot examples generally work

[13:56 - 13:59]
better than zero shot which we'll talk

[13:58 - 14:01]
about later in the prompt engering

[13:59 - 14:03]
section though longer prompts do

[14:01 - 14:05]
increase costs interestingly you don't

[14:03 - 14:07]
always need your strongest model as the

[14:05 - 14:08]
judge specialized smaller models can

[14:07 - 14:10]
often perform evaluation tasks

[14:08 - 14:13]
effectively which helps reduce costs and

[14:10 - 14:15]
latency however of course AI judges have

[14:13 - 14:17]
limitations like all AI applications

[14:15 - 14:19]
they're probalistic the same judge given

[14:17 - 14:21]
the same input can produce different

[14:19 - 14:23]
scores if prompted differently or simply

[14:21 - 14:25]
run twice this makes evaluation results

[14:23 - 14:27]
harder to reproduce or trust

[14:25 - 14:29]
additionally metrics aren't standardized

[14:27 - 14:30]
across different systems one system

[14:29 - 14:33]
system's definition of faithfulness

[14:30 - 14:35]
might differ from anothers Models also

[14:33 - 14:36]
exhibit biases they might prefer

[14:35 - 14:39]
responses from the same model this is

[14:36 - 14:41]
called Self Bias favor the first answer

[14:39 - 14:44]
in a comparison this is position bias or

[14:41 - 14:46]
prefer lengthier answers verbosity bias

[14:44 - 14:47]
you can mitigate these biases through

[14:46 - 14:50]
techniques like randomizing the order of

[14:47 - 14:52]
responses but this also increases costs

[14:50 - 14:53]
now that we understand evaluation let's

[14:52 - 14:56]
tackle one of the most crucial decisions

[14:53 - 14:57]
in AI engineering model selection with

[14:56 - 14:59]
the increasing number of readily

[14:57 - 15:01]
available Foundation models models the

[14:59 - 15:02]
challenge isn't developing models but

[15:01 - 15:04]
selecting the right one for your

[15:02 - 15:05]
application during application

[15:04 - 15:07]
development you'll go through model

[15:05 - 15:09]
selection multiple times as you progress

[15:07 - 15:10]
through different adaptation techniques

[15:09 - 15:12]
for instance when doing prompt

[15:10 - 15:13]
engineering you might start with the

[15:12 - 15:15]
strongest model to evaluate feasibility

[15:13 - 15:17]
then work backwards to see if smaller

[15:15 - 15:19]
models would suffice if you decide to

[15:17 - 15:20]
fine-tune you might start with a small

[15:19 - 15:22]
model to test your code before moving to

[15:20 - 15:24]
a larger one the selection process

[15:22 - 15:26]
typically involves two key steps first

[15:24 - 15:29]
finding the best achievable performance

[15:26 - 15:31]
on the task and then second mapping

[15:29 - 15:32]
models along a cost performance axis and

[15:31 - 15:34]
choosing the model that gives the best

[15:32 - 15:36]
performance for your budget your

[15:34 - 15:38]
criteria for evaluating a model can be

[15:36 - 15:40]
organized into four buckets first domain

[15:38 - 15:42]
specific capabilities how well does the

[15:40 - 15:44]
model understand your specific domain

[15:42 - 15:46]
for example if you're summarizing legal

[15:44 - 15:48]
documents how well does it understand

[15:46 - 15:51]
legal terminology second General

[15:48 - 15:52]
capabilities how coherent faithful or

[15:51 - 15:55]
factually consistent are the outputs

[15:52 - 15:56]
third instruction following capabilities

[15:55 - 15:58]
does the model follow the format and

[15:56 - 15:59]
structure you requested and fourth cost

[15:58 - 16:01]
and latency

[15:59 - 16:03]
how expensive is the model to run and

[16:01 - 16:05]
how quickly does it respond sometimes

[16:03 - 16:06]
rather than evaluating absolute quality

[16:05 - 16:08]
you just need to determine which model

[16:06 - 16:09]
is best for your use case this can be

[16:08 - 16:12]
done through point-wise evaluation so

[16:09 - 16:13]
you score each model independently or

[16:12 - 16:15]
comparative evaluation where you

[16:13 - 16:17]
directly compare outputs when evaluating

[16:15 - 16:18]
models you also need to differentiate

[16:17 - 16:20]
between hard attributes and soft

[16:18 - 16:22]
attributes hard attributes are

[16:20 - 16:24]
impossible or impractical to change

[16:22 - 16:27]
these include license restrictions

[16:24 - 16:29]
training data composition model size

[16:27 - 16:30]
privacy requirements and the level of

[16:29 - 16:31]
control you need these are often

[16:30 - 16:33]
determined by the model providers or

[16:31 - 16:35]
your own internal policies and they can

[16:33 - 16:37]
significantly limit your pool of options

[16:35 - 16:38]
soft attributes on the otherand can be

[16:37 - 16:40]
improved through adaptation techniques

[16:38 - 16:42]
like prompt engineering or fine-tuning

[16:40 - 16:44]
these include things like accuracy

[16:42 - 16:46]
toxicity and factual consistency a high

[16:44 - 16:48]
level workflow for model selection looks

[16:46 - 16:50]
like this filter out models whose hard

[16:48 - 16:51]
attributes don't work for you then use

[16:50 - 16:53]
publicly available information like

[16:51 - 16:55]
Benchmark performance to narrow down to

[16:53 - 16:56]
the most promising candidates third run

[16:55 - 16:58]
your own experiments to find the best

[16:56 - 17:00]
model given all of your objectives

[16:58 - 17:02]
fourth continually monitor your chosen

[17:00 - 17:03]
model in production to detect failures

[17:02 - 17:05]
and collect feedback most companies

[17:03 - 17:06]
won't build Foundation models from

[17:05 - 17:09]
scratch so another question is whether

[17:06 - 17:10]
to use commercial model apis or host an

[17:09 - 17:13]
open source model yourself let's clarify

[17:10 - 17:14]
some terminology first originally open

[17:13 - 17:16]
source meant any model you could

[17:14 - 17:18]
download and use but some argue that a

[17:16 - 17:20]
model should only be considered truly

[17:18 - 17:21]
open source if its training data is also

[17:20 - 17:23]
publicly available this allows for more

[17:21 - 17:25]
flexible usage like retraining from

[17:23 - 17:27]
scratch with modifications models with

[17:25 - 17:29]
open weights but closed training data

[17:27 - 17:30]
are sometimes called open weight models

[17:29 - 17:33]
while those with both open weights and

[17:30 - 17:34]
open data are open models so most

[17:33 - 17:36]
so-called open source models are

[17:34 - 17:37]
actually just open weight these models

[17:36 - 17:39]
also come with different licenses that

[17:37 - 17:40]
may restrict commercial use or limit how

[17:39 - 17:43]
you can use the model's outputs for

[17:40 - 17:45]
training other models for a model to be

[17:43 - 17:46]
accessible to users a machine needs to

[17:45 - 17:48]
host and run it the service that hosts

[17:46 - 17:49]
the model and handles queries is often

[17:48 - 17:51]
called the inference service while the

[17:49 - 17:53]
interface the users interact with is the

[17:51 - 17:55]
model API after creating a model

[17:53 - 17:58]
developers can choose to open source it

[17:55 - 17:59]
make it accessible via an API or both

[17:58 - 18:01]
typically model providers open source

[17:59 - 18:03]
their weaker models and keep their best

[18:01 - 18:05]
ones behind pay walls whether to host a

[18:03 - 18:07]
model yourself or use a model API

[18:05 - 18:09]
depends on several factors First Data

[18:07 - 18:11]
privacy if your company has strict data

[18:09 - 18:13]
privacy policies that prevent sending

[18:11 - 18:15]
data outside the organization externally

[18:13 - 18:17]
hosted model apis are not an option

[18:15 - 18:18]
there's also the risk that API providers

[18:17 - 18:21]
might use your data to train their

[18:18 - 18:23]
models next data lineage and copyright

[18:21 - 18:24]
most models aren't transparent about

[18:23 - 18:26]
their training data and intellectual

[18:24 - 18:28]
property laws around AI are still

[18:26 - 18:30]
evolving it's unclear whether using a

[18:28 - 18:32]
model train on copyrighted data could

[18:30 - 18:34]
create legal issues for your product

[18:32 - 18:36]
next performance the gap between open

[18:34 - 18:38]
sourced and proprietary models is

[18:36 - 18:39]
closing but the strongest models will

[18:38 - 18:41]
likely remain proprietary commercial

[18:39 - 18:43]
apis often provide additional

[18:41 - 18:45]
capabilities out of the box like

[18:43 - 18:48]
scalability function calling so

[18:45 - 18:49]
accessing external tools for example

[18:48 - 18:51]
structured outputs and output guard

[18:49 - 18:53]
rails these can be challenging to

[18:51 - 18:55]
implement yourself so many companies

[18:53 - 18:56]
turn to API providers however this means

[18:55 - 18:58]
you'll be restricted to their

[18:56 - 19:00]
functionality you might not be able to

[18:58 - 19:02]
fine-tune or access log probabilities

[19:00 - 19:04]
for example typically proprietary models

[19:02 - 19:06]
are easy to start with and scale but

[19:04 - 19:08]
they can become expensive with heavy

[19:06 - 19:10]
usage and offer less flexibility it's

[19:08 - 19:12]
wise to design your application with a

[19:10 - 19:14]
standard internal API so you can easily

[19:12 - 19:16]
swap between models if needed control is

[19:14 - 19:18]
another consideration what happens if

[19:16 - 19:20]
your API provider goes out of business

[19:18 - 19:22]
changes their terms of service or is

[19:20 - 19:24]
banned in certain regions and if you

[19:22 - 19:26]
want to run a model on device thirdparty

[19:24 - 19:28]
apis aren't an option there are numerous

[19:26 - 19:29]
benchmarks for different use cases and a

[19:28 - 19:31]
tool tool that helps you evaluate a

[19:29 - 19:33]
model on multiple benchmarks is called

[19:31 - 19:36]
an evaluation harness for example open

[19:33 - 19:38]
AI evals lets you run any of around 500

[19:36 - 19:40]
existing benchmarks to evaluate their

[19:38 - 19:42]
models when using public leaderboards

[19:40 - 19:43]
you need to consider which benchmarks to

[19:42 - 19:45]
include in your aggregated ranking how

[19:43 - 19:47]
to weigh different benchmarks and how to

[19:45 - 19:50]
handle benchmarks that use different

[19:47 - 19:51]
metrics like accuracy F1 blue Etc keep

[19:50 - 19:53]
in mind that the goal is to select a

[19:51 - 19:55]
small subset of models for more rigorous

[19:53 - 19:57]
testing with your own benchmarks and

[19:55 - 19:58]
metrics public benchmarks rarely

[19:57 - 20:00]
represent your applications need

[19:58 - 20:02]
perfectly and they may suffer from data

[20:00 - 20:03]
contamination which is when the models

[20:02 - 20:05]
were trained on the same data they're

[20:03 - 20:07]
being evaluated on to deal with

[20:05 - 20:09]
contamination you first need to detect

[20:07 - 20:11]
it using her istics like engram

[20:09 - 20:14]
overlapping and perplexity if perplexity

[20:11 - 20:15]
on the evaluation data is unusually low

[20:14 - 20:16]
it's possible the model has seen this

[20:15 - 20:18]
during training once you've narrowed

[20:16 - 20:20]
down your model candidates you need a

[20:18 - 20:23]
robust evaluation pipeline evaluate both

[20:20 - 20:25]
the endtoend output and each component

[20:23 - 20:26]
intermediate outputs independently you

[20:25 - 20:28]
can use something called turn-based

[20:26 - 20:31]
evaluation where you assess the quality

[20:28 - 20:32]
of each output and task-based evaluation

[20:31 - 20:34]
where you measure whether the system

[20:32 - 20:36]
completes a task and how many turns it

[20:34 - 20:39]
takes first think about what makes a

[20:36 - 20:41]
good response factors like relevance

[20:39 - 20:43]
factual consistency and safety then

[20:41 - 20:44]
create test queries and generate

[20:43 - 20:47]
multiple responses to see how models

[20:44 - 20:49]
perform develop detailed rubrics with

[20:47 - 20:51]
examples for your scoring system whether

[20:49 - 20:53]
you use binary scores continuous scales

[20:51 - 20:55]
or something else depends on your data

[20:53 - 20:57]
and your needs the key is to make your

[20:55 - 20:59]
rubric unambiguous so that human

[20:57 - 21:01]
evaluators can follow it consistently ly

[20:59 - 21:03]
most importantly tie your evaluation

[21:01 - 21:04]
metrics to business metrics if your

[21:03 - 21:07]
customer support chatbots factual

[21:04 - 21:08]
consistency is 80% what does that mean

[21:07 - 21:10]
for the business perhaps you can

[21:08 - 21:12]
automate 30% of customer support

[21:10 - 21:15]
requests at that level but at 90%

[21:12 - 21:16]
consistency you could automate 50% this

[21:15 - 21:18]
lets you quantify the business impact of

[21:16 - 21:20]
model improvements you'll also need to

[21:18 - 21:23]
establish a usefulness threshold for

[21:20 - 21:24]
instance your chat bot must be 90%

[21:23 - 21:26]
factually consistent to be viable in

[21:24 - 21:29]
production different criteria might

[21:26 - 21:31]
require different evaluation methods

[21:29 - 21:33]
you might use a specialized toxicity

[21:31 - 21:35]
classifier semantic similarity metrics

[21:33 - 21:38]
to measure relevance and an AI judge to

[21:35 - 21:39]
assess factual consistency you can even

[21:38 - 21:42]
mix and match evaluation methods for the

[21:39 - 21:44]
same criteria for example maybe use a

[21:42 - 21:47]
cheap classifier on all your data and an

[21:44 - 21:49]
expensive AI judge on just 1% for high

[21:47 - 21:51]
quality signals while automated metrics

[21:49 - 21:53]
are preferable for scale don't hesitate

[21:51 - 21:55]
to include human evaluation even in

[21:53 - 21:57]
production just do it on a subset of

[21:55 - 21:59]
data to keep costs manageable it's also

[21:57 - 22:01]
crucial to evaluate application on

[21:59 - 22:03]
different slices of data or users to

[22:01 - 22:06]
ensure it performs well across segments

[22:03 - 22:07]
and avoid biases this helps you identify

[22:06 - 22:10]
areas for improvement and prevent

[22:07 - 22:12]
Simpsons Paradox where a model performs

[22:10 - 22:14]
better on aggregate but worse on each

[22:12 - 22:15]
individual subset how much evaluation

[22:14 - 22:18]
data you need depends on your

[22:15 - 22:20]
application and methods generally you

[22:18 - 22:22]
want enough to be reliable but not so

[22:20 - 22:23]
much that costs become prohibitive a

[22:22 - 22:25]
good way to test reliability is to

[22:23 - 22:27]
create multiple bootstrap samples of

[22:25 - 22:29]
your evaluation set and see if they

[22:27 - 22:31]
yield similar results if you get 90% on

[22:29 - 22:33]
one bootstrap but 70% on another your

[22:31 - 22:35]
evaluation pipeline isn't trustworthy

[22:33 - 22:36]
finally evaluate the reliability of your

[22:35 - 22:38]
pipeline itself first is it getting

[22:36 - 22:41]
signals right do better responses indeed

[22:38 - 22:42]
get higher scores next do better

[22:41 - 22:44]
evaluation metrics lead to Better

[22:42 - 22:46]
Business outcomes third how reliable is

[22:44 - 22:48]
the pipeline if you run it twice do you

[22:46 - 22:50]
get the same results fourth how

[22:48 - 22:51]
correlated are your metrics you don't

[22:50 - 22:53]
need two metrics if they're perfectly

[22:51 - 22:55]
correlated but completely uncorrelated

[22:53 - 22:57]
metrics might indicate problems and

[22:55 - 22:58]
finally what cost and latency does your

[22:57 - 23:00]
evaluation pipeline add your your

[22:58 - 23:02]
application model selection remains one

[23:00 - 23:04]
of the hardest but most important topics

[23:02 - 23:06]
in AI engineering with the rapidly

[23:04 - 23:07]
growing number of foundation models

[23:06 - 23:09]
available your challenge isn't

[23:07 - 23:11]
developing models but selecting the

[23:09 - 23:13]
right one for your specific needs

[23:11 - 23:15]
balancing performance cost privacy and

[23:13 - 23:17]
control now let's dive into what might

[23:15 - 23:19]
be the most accessible yet surprisingly

[23:17 - 23:22]
nuanced aspect of AI engineering prompt

[23:19 - 23:23]
engineering if you've ever used chat GPT

[23:22 - 23:25]
you've already done some form of prompt

[23:23 - 23:27]
engineering but there's much more to it

[23:25 - 23:28]
than just typing questions prompt

[23:27 - 23:30]
engineering refers to the process of

[23:28 - 23:32]
crafting instructions that guide a model

[23:30 - 23:34]
to generate your desired outcome it's

[23:32 - 23:36]
the easiest and most common model

[23:34 - 23:38]
adaptation technique because unlike fine

[23:36 - 23:39]
tuning it doesn't change the model's

[23:38 - 23:41]
weights you're just telling the model

[23:39 - 23:43]
what you want it to do while it's the

[23:41 - 23:44]
most accessible entry point to AI

[23:43 - 23:46]
engineering don't be fooled into

[23:44 - 23:48]
thinking that it's simplistic effective

[23:46 - 23:50]
prompt engineering requires the same

[23:48 - 23:52]
experimental rigor as any machine

[23:50 - 23:54]
learning task you should extract maximum

[23:52 - 23:55]
value from prompting before moving to

[23:54 - 23:57]
more resource intensive techniques like

[23:55 - 23:58]
fine-tuning that said understanding

[23:57 - 24:00]
prompt engineering alone isn't enough

[23:58 - 24:02]
for production ready systems you'll

[24:00 - 24:03]
still need knowledge of Statistics

[24:02 - 24:05]
engineering and classical ml for

[24:03 - 24:07]
experiment tracking evaluation and data

[24:05 - 24:10]
set curation prompts typically consist

[24:07 - 24:12]
of one or more of these components first

[24:10 - 24:15]
the task description this includes the

[24:12 - 24:17]
model's role and expected output format

[24:15 - 24:18]
for example you are a helpful medical

[24:17 - 24:20]
assistant analyze the following symptoms

[24:18 - 24:22]
and suggest possible conditions listing

[24:20 - 24:24]
them in order of likelihood next

[24:22 - 24:26]
examples these show the model how to

[24:24 - 24:28]
perform the task for instance if you

[24:26 - 24:30]
want a model to classify text as toxic

[24:28 - 24:33]
or non-toxic you might include examples

[24:30 - 24:34]
of each third the concrete task this is

[24:33 - 24:36]
the specific job you want the model to

[24:34 - 24:37]
do like answering a question or

[24:36 - 24:38]
summarizing a book how much prompt

[24:37 - 24:40]
engineering you need depends on the

[24:38 - 24:42]
model's robustness to prompt

[24:40 - 24:43]
perturbation a robust model shouldn't

[24:42 - 24:45]
produce dramatically different outputs

[24:43 - 24:48]
if you write the number five versus

[24:45 - 24:50]
write it out FIV this robustness is

[24:48 - 24:51]
strongly correlated with a model's

[24:50 - 24:52]
overall capability it's also worth

[24:51 - 24:54]
noting that different models have

[24:52 - 24:56]
different preferred prompt structures

[24:54 - 24:58]
for example GPT 4 typically performs

[24:56 - 24:59]
better when the task description is at

[24:58 - 25:01]
the beginning of the prompt while llama

[24:59 - 25:03]
3 does better when the task appears at

[25:01 - 25:05]
the end teaching models what to do via

[25:03 - 25:07]
prompts is known as in context learning

[25:05 - 25:10]
each example in your prompt is called a

[25:07 - 25:12]
shot so we get the terms few shot zero

[25:10 - 25:13]
shot and one shot learning how many

[25:12 - 25:15]
examples you need depends on both the

[25:13 - 25:17]
model and your application so

[25:15 - 25:18]
experimentation is necessary the number

[25:17 - 25:20]
of examples you can include is limited

[25:18 - 25:23]
by the model's context length and for

[25:20 - 25:25]
API models your cost constraints many

[25:23 - 25:27]
modern models distinguish between system

[25:25 - 25:29]
and user prompts the system prompt

[25:27 - 25:30]
contains the Tas task description

[25:29 - 25:33]
telling the model what role to play its

[25:30 - 25:35]
goals and constraints the user prompt

[25:33 - 25:37]
contains the specific task or query

[25:35 - 25:38]
almost all applications like trpt have

[25:37 - 25:40]
system prompts usually created by the

[25:38 - 25:42]
application developers rather than end

[25:40 - 25:44]
users these system and user prompts are

[25:42 - 25:46]
combined using a template that can vary

[25:44 - 25:47]
between models and versions if you use

[25:46 - 25:50]
the wrong template you might experience

[25:47 - 25:51]
unexpected performance issues even small

[25:50 - 25:53]
mistakes like an extra new line can

[25:51 - 25:55]
cause problems when constructing inputs

[25:53 - 25:57]
make sure to follow the model's chat

[25:55 - 25:58]
template exactly this is especially

[25:57 - 26:00]
important if you're using using third

[25:58 - 26:03]
party tools to construct prompts as

[26:00 - 26:05]
template mismatches often lead to silent

[26:03 - 26:06]
failures models typically understand

[26:05 - 26:08]
instructions better when they appear at

[26:06 - 26:09]
the beginning or end of The Prompt

[26:08 - 26:11]
rather than buried in the middle let's

[26:09 - 26:13]
go through some key strategies for

[26:11 - 26:15]
Effective prompt engineering first write

[26:13 - 26:17]
clear and explicit instructions if you

[26:15 - 26:19]
want a model to score an essay explain

[26:17 - 26:21]
the scoring system you want it to use

[26:19 - 26:22]
should it allow fractional scores what

[26:21 - 26:25]
should it do if it can't determine an

[26:22 - 26:27]
answer be specific to reduce ambiguity

[26:25 - 26:29]
second ask the model to adopt a Persona

[26:27 - 26:30]
asking a model to respond as a

[26:29 - 26:32]
particular character or expert can

[26:30 - 26:35]
significantly change its output style

[26:32 - 26:37]
and focus for example respond as an

[26:35 - 26:39]
experienced pediatrician or answer as if

[26:37 - 26:41]
you were explaining it to a 10-year-old

[26:39 - 26:43]
third provide examples examples can

[26:41 - 26:45]
dramatically shift a model's response

[26:43 - 26:48]
style for instance asking will Santa

[26:45 - 26:50]
bring me presents without examples might

[26:48 - 26:52]
get a straight no Santa is fictional

[26:50 - 26:53]
response but if you provide an example

[26:52 - 26:55]
of a Whimsical answer about the Tooth

[26:53 - 26:58]
Fairy the model is more likely to play

[26:55 - 27:00]
along four specify the output format

[26:58 - 27:02]
tell the model exactly how you want the

[27:00 - 27:04]
response structured this might mean

[27:02 - 27:06]
requesting things like no preambles so

[27:04 - 27:08]
none of this based on the content of

[27:06 - 27:10]
this essay I'd give it a score of dot

[27:08 - 27:12]
dot dot you can also ask for specific

[27:10 - 27:15]
formats like Json or markdown and

[27:12 - 27:17]
particular sections or headings five

[27:15 - 27:19]
break complex tasks into simpler

[27:17 - 27:20]
subtasks this not only improves

[27:19 - 27:23]
performance but also makes monitoring

[27:20 - 27:24]
debugging and parallelization easier

[27:23 - 27:26]
however it can increase the latency

[27:24 - 27:28]
perceived by users if they don't see the

[27:26 - 27:29]
intermediate outputs you can also use

[27:28 - 27:32]
cheaper models for simpler steps to

[27:29 - 27:34]
reduce cost six give the model time to

[27:32 - 27:35]
think several techniques can improve

[27:34 - 27:37]
model reasoning Chain of Thought

[27:35 - 27:40]
prompting so think this through step by

[27:37 - 27:42]
step process instructions so something

[27:40 - 27:45]
like first analyze the key themes second

[27:42 - 27:47]
identify the author's perspective and so

[27:45 - 27:49]
on next self-critique ask the model to

[27:47 - 27:50]
check its own work these approaches

[27:49 - 27:53]
generally improve quality but increase

[27:50 - 27:56]
latency and token usage seven iterate

[27:53 - 27:57]
systematically this is so important

[27:56 - 27:59]
different techniques work better for

[27:57 - 28:01]
different models so experimentation is

[27:59 - 28:03]
crucial always version your prompts and

[28:01 - 28:05]
use an experiment tracking tool with

[28:03 - 28:08]
standardized evaluation metrics and data

[28:05 - 28:10]
also separate prompts from code store

[28:08 - 28:11]
them in configuration files rather than

[28:10 - 28:13]
hardcoding them this will make it way

[28:11 - 28:15]
easier to update various tools aim to

[28:13 - 28:17]
automate The Prompt engineering workflow

[28:15 - 28:19]
including open prompt and dspi these

[28:17 - 28:21]
tools let you specify input and output

[28:19 - 28:23]
formats evaluation metrics and

[28:21 - 28:25]
evaluation data then essentially they

[28:23 - 28:27]
perform automl to find the optimal

[28:25 - 28:29]
prompts however these tools can be

[28:27 - 28:31]
expensive if if they make many API calls

[28:29 - 28:32]
under the hood they also might produce

[28:31 - 28:34]
prompts with typos or other issues and

[28:32 - 28:36]
they may not keep up with changing model

[28:34 - 28:38]
requirements for these reasons it's best

[28:36 - 28:39]
to start with manual prompt engineering

[28:38 - 28:41]
before moving to automated tools you can

[28:39 - 28:43]
also use AI models themselves to write

[28:41 - 28:45]
and refine prompts once your application

[28:43 - 28:46]
is available to users it may face

[28:45 - 28:48]
attacks from malicious actors trying to

[28:46 - 28:50]
exploit it three main types of prompt

[28:48 - 28:52]
attacks include prompt extraction

[28:50 - 28:53]
attacks where attackers might try to

[28:52 - 28:56]
extract your system prompt to either

[28:53 - 28:58]
replicate or exploit your application

[28:56 - 28:59]
jailbreaking and prompt injection the

[28:58 - 29:01]
attacks attempt to subvert the model's

[28:59 - 29:03]
safety features or get it to perform

[29:01 - 29:05]
unauthorized actions like providing

[29:03 - 29:07]
instructions for harmful activities or

[29:05 - 29:09]
executing dangerous code and third

[29:07 - 29:10]
information extraction these attacks try

[29:09 - 29:12]
to get the model to reveal sensitive

[29:10 - 29:14]
information from its training data or

[29:12 - 29:16]
context to defend against these attacks

[29:14 - 29:18]
consider the following strategies use

[29:16 - 29:20]
benchmarks to evaluate safety against

[29:18 - 29:22]
adversarial attacks conduct security red

[29:20 - 29:24]
teaming to proactively find weaknesses

[29:22 - 29:26]
be explicit in your prompts about what

[29:24 - 29:28]
information the model should not return

[29:26 - 29:29]
repeat the system prompt before and

[29:28 - 29:31]
after user inputs to remind the model of

[29:29 - 29:33]
its constraints Design Systems with

[29:31 - 29:36]
safety boundaries like running generated

[29:33 - 29:37]
code only in isolated environments

[29:36 - 29:40]
require human approval for potentially

[29:37 - 29:42]
impactful actions define out of scope

[29:40 - 29:44]
topics for your application use anomaly

[29:42 - 29:46]
detection to identify unusual prompts

[29:44 - 29:48]
and Implement guardrails on both inputs

[29:46 - 29:50]
and outputs when evaluating your system

[29:48 - 29:53]
security track both the violation rate

[29:50 - 29:55]
so how often attack succeed and the

[29:53 - 29:57]
false refusal rate how often the model

[29:55 - 29:59]
incorrectly refuses legitimate requests

[29:57 - 30:00]
you need to balance these metrics

[29:59 - 30:02]
perfect security with too many false

[30:00 - 30:04]
refusals creates a really frustrating

[30:02 - 30:06]
user experience by approaching prompt

[30:04 - 30:08]
engineering with this combination of

[30:06 - 30:10]
creativity and riger you can extract

[30:08 - 30:11]
remarkable performance from Foundation

[30:10 - 30:13]
models without the complexity and

[30:11 - 30:15]
expense of fine-tuning remember that

[30:13 - 30:17]
small changes in your prompts can lead

[30:15 - 30:19]
to significant improvements in output

[30:17 - 30:21]
quality so experiment widely and measure

[30:19 - 30:22]
carefully now that we've covered prompt

[30:21 - 30:24]
engineering let's explore how to give

[30:22 - 30:26]
Foundation models access to information

[30:24 - 30:28]
beyond what they were trained on to

[30:26 - 30:30]
solve a task effectively a model needs

[30:28 - 30:31]
two things instructions on how to

[30:30 - 30:33]
perform the task and the necessary

[30:31 - 30:35]
information to complete it two dominant

[30:33 - 30:36]
patterns have emerged for providing

[30:35 - 30:38]
models with the information they need

[30:36 - 30:40]
retrieval augmented generation or rag

[30:38 - 30:42]
and the agentic pattern rag allows

[30:40 - 30:44]
models to retrieve relevant information

[30:42 - 30:46]
from external data sources while the

[30:44 - 30:48]
agentic pattern enables models to use

[30:46 - 30:50]
tools like web search and apis to gather

[30:48 - 30:53]
information actively while rag is

[30:50 - 30:54]
primarily used for context construction

[30:53 - 30:56]
the agentic pattern can do much more

[30:54 - 30:59]
let's start with rag first so what is

[30:56 - 31:00]
rag retrieval augmented generation is a

[30:59 - 31:02]
technique that enhances a model's

[31:00 - 31:04]
generation capabilities by retrieving

[31:02 - 31:06]
relevant information from external

[31:04 - 31:09]
memory sources these sources could be an

[31:06 - 31:10]
internal database a user's previous chat

[31:09 - 31:12]
sessions or even the internet you can

[31:10 - 31:14]
think of rag as a technique to construct

[31:12 - 31:15]
context specific to each query

[31:14 - 31:17]
connecting the model with information it

[31:15 - 31:19]
wasn't trained on or might have

[31:17 - 31:21]
forgotten a rag system consists of two

[31:19 - 31:23]
main components a retriever that fetches

[31:21 - 31:25]
the information from the external memory

[31:23 - 31:27]
source and a generator the foundation

[31:25 - 31:29]
model that produces a response based on

[31:27 - 31:30]
the retrieved information in today's rag

[31:29 - 31:32]
systems these components are often

[31:30 - 31:34]
trained separately with many teams using

[31:32 - 31:36]
off-the-shelf Retriever and models

[31:34 - 31:38]
however fine tuning the entire rag

[31:36 - 31:40]
system from end to end can significantly

[31:38 - 31:42]
improve performance the success of a rag

[31:40 - 31:44]
system heavily depends on its retriever

[31:42 - 31:46]
a retriever performs two main functions

[31:44 - 31:48]
indexing and querying indexing involves

[31:46 - 31:50]
processing data so that it can quickly

[31:48 - 31:51]
be retrieved later this is the

[31:50 - 31:53]
preparatory step where you organize your

[31:51 - 31:55]
knowledge base querying is the process

[31:53 - 31:57]
of sending a search query to retrieve

[31:55 - 31:58]
data relevant to it how you index your

[31:57 - 32:00]
data determines how you retrieve it

[31:58 - 32:01]
later let's walk through a simple

[32:00 - 32:03]
example imagine your external memory as

[32:01 - 32:05]
a database of documents like contracts

[32:03 - 32:07]
or meeting notes these documents can

[32:05 - 32:09]
range from 10 tokens to a million tokens

[32:07 - 32:10]
in length naively retrieving whole

[32:09 - 32:12]
documents would make your context

[32:10 - 32:14]
arbitrarily long potentially exceeding

[32:12 - 32:16]
the model's context window to avoid this

[32:14 - 32:18]
you typically split each document into

[32:16 - 32:20]
smaller chunks which we'll discuss later

[32:18 - 32:22]
for each user query your goal is to

[32:20 - 32:24]
retrieve the data chunks most relevant

[32:22 - 32:25]
to that query then with some

[32:24 - 32:28]
postprocessing to join the retrieved

[32:25 - 32:30]
chunks with the user's prompt you the

[32:28 - 32:31]
final prompt that goes to the model many

[32:30 - 32:34]
existing retrieval algorithms can be

[32:31 - 32:35]
used for rag retrieval works by ranking

[32:34 - 32:37]
documents based on their relevance to a

[32:35 - 32:39]
given query and algorithms differ in how

[32:37 - 32:41]
they compute these relevant scores first

[32:39 - 32:43]
term-based retrieval this is also called

[32:41 - 32:45]
lexical retrieval and this approach

[32:43 - 32:47]
finds relevant documents based on

[32:45 - 32:49]
keywords while this is straightforward

[32:47 - 32:51]
it has several limitations so many

[32:49 - 32:53]
documents might contain a term without

[32:51 - 32:55]
truly being about it and queries can be

[32:53 - 32:57]
long with many terms that aren't equally

[32:55 - 33:00]
important so tfidf can help address this

[32:57 - 33:02]
this also simple tokenization can miss

[33:00 - 33:03]
semantic relationships term-based

[33:02 - 33:05]
retrieval is generally faster than

[33:03 - 33:08]
embedding based approaches during both

[33:05 - 33:09]
indexing and querying it also works well

[33:08 - 33:11]
out of the box with existing systems

[33:09 - 33:13]
like elastic search embedding based

[33:11 - 33:15]
retrieval is another option this

[33:13 - 33:17]
approach computes relevance at the

[33:15 - 33:19]
semantic level rather than a lexical one

[33:17 - 33:21]
ranking documents based on how closely

[33:19 - 33:23]
their meaning aligns with the query the

[33:21 - 33:24]
process works like this convert your

[33:23 - 33:26]
original data to embeddings using an

[33:24 - 33:28]
embedding model store these embeddings

[33:26 - 33:30]
in a vector database when a query comes

[33:28 - 33:32]
in convert it to an embedding using the

[33:30 - 33:33]
same model fetch the K data chunks whose

[33:32 - 33:35]
embeddings are closest to the query

[33:33 - 33:37]
embedding and return them Vector search

[33:35 - 33:38]
is typically framed as a k nearest

[33:37 - 33:40]
neighbor search problem this can be

[33:38 - 33:42]
computationally expensive for large data

[33:40 - 33:43]
sets so approximate nearest neighbors

[33:42 - 33:45]
algorithms are often used instead in

[33:43 - 33:47]
practice most developers won't Implement

[33:45 - 33:48]
Vector search themselves but will use

[33:47 - 33:50]
existing Vector databases these

[33:48 - 33:53]
databases organize vectors into buckets

[33:50 - 33:54]
trees or graphs using various fistic to

[33:53 - 33:56]
increase the likelihood that similar

[33:54 - 33:57]
vectors are stored close to each other

[33:56 - 33:59]
embedding based retrieval can sign

[33:57 - 34:01]
significantly outperform term-based

[33:59 - 34:02]
retrieval over time especially if you

[34:01 - 34:05]
fine-tune your embedding model and

[34:02 - 34:06]
retriever but it has its downsides it

[34:05 - 34:08]
can make it harder to search for

[34:06 - 34:10]
specific names or error codes and

[34:08 - 34:12]
generating embeddings can be expensive

[34:10 - 34:13]
and introduce latency a production

[34:12 - 34:16]
retrieval system typically combines

[34:13 - 34:17]
several approaches for example a cheaper

[34:16 - 34:20]
less precise retriever like turn-based

[34:17 - 34:21]
search might first fetch candidates and

[34:20 - 34:23]
then a more precise but expensive

[34:21 - 34:25]
mechanism like KNN finds the best

[34:23 - 34:27]
options among those candidates depending

[34:25 - 34:28]
on your task certain tactics can

[34:27 - 34:30]
increase the chance of retrieving

[34:28 - 34:32]
relevant documents the simplest approach

[34:30 - 34:34]
is to divide documents into chunks of

[34:32 - 34:35]
equal length based on characters words

[34:34 - 34:37]
sentences or paragraphs overlapping

[34:35 - 34:39]
chunks can ensure that important

[34:37 - 34:41]
boundary information is included in at

[34:39 - 34:42]
least one chunk smaller chunk sizes

[34:41 - 34:44]
allow for more diverse information since

[34:42 - 34:46]
you can fit more chunks into the model's

[34:44 - 34:48]
context but this can also result in the

[34:46 - 34:50]
loss of important context smaller chunks

[34:48 - 34:52]
also increase computational overhead

[34:50 - 34:54]
especially for embedding based retrieval

[34:52 - 34:56]
there's no Universal best chunk size or

[34:54 - 34:57]
overlap percentage you just need to

[34:56 - 34:59]
experiment based on your specific data

[34:57 - 35:01]
and task the initial document rankings

[34:59 - 35:03]
generated by the retriever can be

[35:01 - 35:04]
further refined to be more accurate this

[35:03 - 35:06]
is especially useful when you need to

[35:04 - 35:08]
reduce the number of retrieve documents

[35:06 - 35:10]
due to context window limitations

[35:08 - 35:12]
documents could be reranked based on

[35:10 - 35:14]
various factors such as recency so maybe

[35:12 - 35:16]
you give more weight to newer data or

[35:14 - 35:19]
additional relevant signals next let's

[35:16 - 35:22]
talk about query rewriting also known as

[35:19 - 35:24]
query reformulation normalization or

[35:22 - 35:26]
expansion this technique involves

[35:24 - 35:28]
rewriting queries to include necessary

[35:26 - 35:31]
context for example if a user asks

[35:28 - 35:33]
what's its population after previously

[35:31 - 35:35]
asking about Paris the query might be

[35:33 - 35:38]
expanded to what's the population of

[35:35 - 35:40]
Paris each chunk can be augmented with

[35:38 - 35:41]
relevant context to make it easier to

[35:40 - 35:44]
retrieve this might include metadata

[35:41 - 35:45]
like tags and keywords or for e-commerce

[35:44 - 35:48]
products it could be information like

[35:45 - 35:49]
descriptions and reviews you can also

[35:48 - 35:51]
augment chunks with context from the

[35:49 - 35:53]
full document to help them retain more

[35:51 - 35:54]
of the original meaning for example

[35:53 - 35:56]
maybe a summary of the entire document

[35:54 - 35:58]
when choosing a retrieval solution

[35:56 - 36:00]
consider first first what retrieval

[35:58 - 36:03]
mechanisms it supports term-based

[36:00 - 36:05]
embedding based and or hybrid for Vector

[36:03 - 36:07]
databases what embedding models and

[36:05 - 36:09]
Vector search algorithms are supported

[36:07 - 36:11]
also consider scalability both for data

[36:09 - 36:13]
storage and query traffic you'll need to

[36:11 - 36:16]
think about indexing speed and batch

[36:13 - 36:17]
processing capabilities query latency

[36:16 - 36:19]
pricing structure and compliance

[36:17 - 36:21]
requirements as well it's also important

[36:19 - 36:23]
to note that rag isn't limited to just

[36:21 - 36:25]
text it can also be used with multimodal

[36:23 - 36:27]
and tabular data for instance if a user

[36:25 - 36:29]
asks what's the color of the house in

[36:27 - 36:31]
the Pixar movie up a multimodal rag

[36:29 - 36:32]
system might first retrieve an image of

[36:31 - 36:34]
the house to help the model answer

[36:32 - 36:37]
similarly rag can work with tabular data

[36:34 - 36:38]
using text to SQL conversations the

[36:37 - 36:40]
system can execute a query on a database

[36:38 - 36:42]
and then generate a response based on

[36:40 - 36:44]
the results for complex database schemas

[36:42 - 36:45]
you might need an intermediate step to

[36:44 - 36:47]
predict which table to use for each

[36:45 - 36:48]
query especially if there are too many

[36:47 - 36:50]
tables to fit all the schemas in the

[36:48 - 36:52]
context window in the next part we'll

[36:50 - 36:54]
explore the agentic pattern which goes

[36:52 - 36:56]
beyond passive retrieval to actively

[36:54 - 36:57]
interact with external tools and apis

[36:56 - 37:00]
the agentic pattern is a more active

[36:57 - 37:02]
approach to extending AI capabilities

[37:00 - 37:03]
this is a rapidly evolving field so

[37:02 - 37:05]
consider this section more experimental

[37:03 - 37:07]
than the others we've covered at its

[37:05 - 37:09]
broadest definition an agent is anything

[37:07 - 37:11]
that can perceive its environment and

[37:09 - 37:13]
act upon it for AI systems this means

[37:11 - 37:14]
that a model can observe its environment

[37:13 - 37:16]
make decisions based on those

[37:14 - 37:18]
observations take actions that affect

[37:16 - 37:19]
the environment and learn from the

[37:18 - 37:22]
outcomes of those actions the

[37:19 - 37:24]
environment is defined by the use case

[37:22 - 37:25]
for a game playing Agent the game is the

[37:24 - 37:27]
environment for a web scraping agent the

[37:25 - 37:29]
internet is the environment what makes

[37:27 - 37:31]
agents powerful is the set of tools they

[37:29 - 37:33]
have access to for example chat GPT is

[37:31 - 37:35]
an agent that can search the web execute

[37:33 - 37:37]
python code and generate images among

[37:35 - 37:39]
other capabilities remember our rag

[37:37 - 37:41]
example with tabular data that was

[37:39 - 37:43]
actually a simple agent with three

[37:41 - 37:45]
actions generating SQL queries executing

[37:43 - 37:47]
those queries and producing a response

[37:45 - 37:49]
let's see how this works in practice if

[37:47 - 37:52]
a user asks project the sales revenue

[37:49 - 37:54]
over the next 3 months the agent might

[37:52 - 37:57]
first reason about how to accomplish the

[37:54 - 37:58]
task then generate a SQL query to fetch

[37:57 - 38:00]
historical sales data next it would

[37:58 - 38:02]
execute that query against the database

[38:00 - 38:04]
analyze if the retrieved information is

[38:02 - 38:06]
sufficient possibly generate and execute

[38:04 - 38:08]
additional queries and then create a

[38:06 - 38:09]
projection based on the gathered data

[38:08 - 38:11]
finally it would conclude that the task

[38:09 - 38:13]
has been successfully completed compared

[38:11 - 38:15]
to simpler AI applications agents

[38:13 - 38:16]
require more powerful models because

[38:15 - 38:18]
they often need to perform multiple

[38:16 - 38:20]
steps to complete a task the overall

[38:18 - 38:22]
success rate decreases with each step

[38:20 - 38:23]
because of compounding errors and the

[38:22 - 38:25]
stakes are higher since agents have

[38:23 - 38:27]
access to potentially powerful tools

[38:25 - 38:29]
speaking of tools agents can be equipped

[38:27 - 38:31]
with various tools which fall into

[38:29 - 38:33]
several categories first knowledge

[38:31 - 38:35]
augmentation tools these could be things

[38:33 - 38:38]
like text or image retrievers as in rag

[38:35 - 38:40]
SQL executors for database access web

[38:38 - 38:43]
search capabilities apis for accessing

[38:40 - 38:44]
inventory systems email readers Etc and

[38:43 - 38:47]
web browsers for navigating online

[38:44 - 38:49]
content whether public or private next

[38:47 - 38:50]
we have capability extension tools like

[38:49 - 38:53]
calculators since AI models often

[38:50 - 38:55]
struggle with complex math time zone or

[38:53 - 38:57]
unit converters translation services and

[38:55 - 38:59]
code interpreters we also have WR action

[38:57 - 39:02]
tools so tools that enable the agent not

[38:59 - 39:04]
just to read but also write to systems

[39:02 - 39:06]
these can automate workflows but require

[39:04 - 39:08]
strong security protocols complex tasks

[39:06 - 39:10]
require planning and there are many

[39:08 - 39:12]
possible ways to decompose a task not

[39:10 - 39:13]
all approaches will be successful and

[39:12 - 39:15]
not all will be efficient to help with

[39:13 - 39:18]
debugging and to prevent cases where a

[39:15 - 39:19]
model executes unnecessary API calls

[39:18 - 39:21]
planning should be decoupled from

[39:19 - 39:23]
execution the process typically works

[39:21 - 39:26]
like this first ask the agent to

[39:23 - 39:28]
generate a plan then validate the plan

[39:26 - 39:30]
before execution and then only execute

[39:28 - 39:32]
once validated plans can be validated

[39:30 - 39:35]
using heris STS like removing plans with

[39:32 - 39:37]
invalid actions or too many steps or by

[39:35 - 39:39]
using another AI model as a judge you

[39:37 - 39:41]
can even generate several plans in

[39:39 - 39:42]
parallel and then ask an evaluator to

[39:41 - 39:44]
pick the most promising one for

[39:42 - 39:46]
particularly important or sensitive

[39:44 - 39:48]
tasks you might want a human in the loop

[39:46 - 39:50]
to review plans before execution while

[39:48 - 39:51]
Foundation model agents use the model

[39:50 - 39:53]
itself as the planner reinforcement

[39:51 - 39:54]
learning agents are trained using

[39:53 - 39:56]
reinforcement learning algorithms this

[39:54 - 39:57]
approach uses more resources than

[39:56 - 39:59]
Foundation models but could offer

[39:57 - 40:01]
performance improvements in the future

[39:59 - 40:02]
the simplest way to turn a model into a

[40:01 - 40:04]
plan generator is through prompt

[40:02 - 40:05]
engineering you tell the model what

[40:04 - 40:07]
functionality it has available and the

[40:05 - 40:09]
expected inputs and outputs for each

[40:07 - 40:10]
tool you can improve your prompts by

[40:09 - 40:13]
writing better system prompts with more

[40:10 - 40:14]
examples providing clearer descriptions

[40:13 - 40:16]
of tools and their parameters

[40:14 - 40:17]
simplifying functions as much as

[40:16 - 40:19]
possible using a stronger model or

[40:17 - 40:21]
fine-tuning a model specifically for

[40:19 - 40:23]
Plan Generation as a practical tip

[40:21 - 40:25]
always ask the system to report what

[40:23 - 40:27]
parameter values it uses for each

[40:25 - 40:28]
function call this provides a sanity

[40:27 - 40:30]
check check that can catch many issues

[40:28 - 40:32]
before execution another useful approach

[40:30 - 40:34]
is to generate plans in natural language

[40:32 - 40:36]
first then translate them to the exact

[40:34 - 40:38]
function calls in a second step this

[40:36 - 40:40]
helps if function names change over time

[40:38 - 40:42]
or if you find a model specifically for

[40:40 - 40:44]
plan creation the translation can often

[40:42 - 40:47]
be done by a smaller cheaper model

[40:44 - 40:48]
agents can fail in various ways so it's

[40:47 - 40:50]
important to have robust evaluation

[40:48 - 40:51]
methods there are lots of different

[40:50 - 40:53]
things that can go wrong so we could

[40:51 - 40:56]
have planning failures like using

[40:53 - 40:58]
invalid tools using valid tools but with

[40:56 - 41:00]
invalid parameters using valid tools

[40:58 - 41:01]
with incorrect parameter values or

[41:00 - 41:03]
failing to achieve the goal or satisfy

[41:01 - 41:05]
constraints to evaluate planning

[41:03 - 41:07]
capability create a data set where each

[41:05 - 41:09]
example is a tuple of task available

[41:07 - 41:11]
tools and constraints for each task use

[41:09 - 41:13]
the agent to generate multiple plans and

[41:11 - 41:15]
compute metrics like the percentage of

[41:13 - 41:17]
generated plans that are valid how many

[41:15 - 41:19]
attempts it takes to get a valid plan

[41:17 - 41:21]
percentage of tools called that are

[41:19 - 41:22]
valid and how often invalid tools are

[41:21 - 41:24]
called you could also have tool failures

[41:22 - 41:26]
so that could include things like bad

[41:24 - 41:27]
translation from high level plans to

[41:26 - 41:30]
specific function name

[41:27 - 41:31]
no access to the required tools or tools

[41:30 - 41:33]
giving incorrect outputs like poorly

[41:31 - 41:35]
generated SQL queries for this your

[41:33 - 41:37]
efficiency metrics might be how many

[41:35 - 41:39]
steps does the agent need on average to

[41:37 - 41:41]
complete a task what's the cost to

[41:39 - 41:42]
complete a task how long does each

[41:41 - 41:44]
action typically take are there

[41:42 - 41:46]
particularly slow or expensive actions

[41:44 - 41:47]
and how does the agent compare to

[41:46 - 41:50]
baselines which might be another agent

[41:47 - 41:51]
or a human one of the key challenges for

[41:50 - 41:53]
agents is remembering information over

[41:51 - 41:56]
time a memory system allows a model to

[41:53 - 41:58]
retain and utilize information across

[41:56 - 42:00]
interactions a a models typically have

[41:58 - 42:02]
three main memory mechanisms there's the

[42:00 - 42:03]
internal knowledge embedded in the model

[42:02 - 42:04]
itself through training there's the

[42:03 - 42:07]
context window which is kind of your

[42:04 - 42:09]
shortterm memory for immediate session

[42:07 - 42:10]
specific information and finally

[42:09 - 42:12]
external data sources like rag systems

[42:10 - 42:14]
this is kind of like your long-term

[42:12 - 42:16]
memory information that is essential to

[42:14 - 42:17]
all tasks should be incorporated via

[42:16 - 42:19]
training rarely needed information

[42:17 - 42:21]
should reside in long-term memory while

[42:19 - 42:23]
short-term memory is for immediate

[42:21 - 42:25]
context specific information benefits of

[42:23 - 42:27]
a well-designed memory management system

[42:25 - 42:29]
include storing information longer than

[42:27 - 42:31]
the context window allows persisting

[42:29 - 42:33]
information between sessions making a

[42:31 - 42:35]
model more consistent in its responses

[42:33 - 42:37]
and actions by combining rag for

[42:35 - 42:40]
information access tools for capability

[42:37 - 42:42]
extension planning for complex tasks and

[42:40 - 42:44]
memory systems for continuity agents can

[42:42 - 42:46]
tackle increasingly sophisticated

[42:44 - 42:48]
problems while this field is still

[42:46 - 42:49]
evolving rapidly it represents one of

[42:48 - 42:51]
the most promising Frontiers in AI

[42:49 - 42:53]
engineering as with all powerful

[42:51 - 42:55]
Technologies agent systems require

[42:53 - 42:57]
careful consideration of safety security

[42:55 - 42:59]
and ethical use the more capable able an

[42:57 - 43:00]
agent becomes the more critical it is to

[42:59 - 43:02]
ensure it operates within appropriate

[43:00 - 43:04]
boundaries and with proper oversight now

[43:02 - 43:06]
let's explore fine tuning the process of

[43:04 - 43:08]
adapting a model to a specific task by

[43:06 - 43:10]
further training it and adjusting its

[43:08 - 43:11]
weights while prompt engineering and rag

[43:10 - 43:14]
are relatively lightweight techniques

[43:11 - 43:15]
fine-tuning offers deeper customization

[43:14 - 43:18]
but requires more resources and

[43:15 - 43:20]
expertise so when to fine-tune fine

[43:18 - 43:22]
tuning can improve a model's performance

[43:20 - 43:24]
in two ways first by enhancing domain

[43:22 - 43:26]
specific capabilities like coding or

[43:24 - 43:28]
answering medical questions and second

[43:26 - 43:29]
improving instruction following

[43:28 - 43:31]
abilities like adhering to specific

[43:29 - 43:33]
output formats however fine tuning

[43:31 - 43:35]
requires significant upfront investment

[43:33 - 43:36]
it often needs more memory than what's

[43:35 - 43:38]
available on a single GPU making it

[43:36 - 43:40]
expensive this is why reducing memory

[43:38 - 43:41]
requirements has become a primary

[43:40 - 43:43]
motivation for many fine-tuning

[43:41 - 43:45]
techniques that we'll discuss later so

[43:43 - 43:46]
you should consider fine-tuning when

[43:45 - 43:48]
you've already exhausted what you can

[43:46 - 43:50]
achieve with prompt-based methods you

[43:48 - 43:52]
need to produce consistent structured

[43:50 - 43:54]
outputs and you're working with smaller

[43:52 - 43:56]
models that need to perform better on

[43:54 - 43:58]
specific tasks a common approach is

[43:56 - 43:59]
model distillation fine-tuning a small

[43:58 - 44:01]
model to imitate a larger model's

[43:59 - 44:04]
Behavior using data generated by the

[44:01 - 44:06]
large model on specific tasks a small

[44:04 - 44:08]
fine-tune model May outperform a larger

[44:06 - 44:10]
general purpose model on the other hand

[44:08 - 44:12]
you should avoid fine-tuning if you need

[44:10 - 44:14]
a general purpose model fine-tuning can

[44:12 - 44:17]
improve performance on specific tasks

[44:14 - 44:18]
but degrade performance on others or if

[44:17 - 44:20]
you're just starting to experiment with

[44:18 - 44:22]
a project many teams jump straight to

[44:20 - 44:24]
find tuning before thoroughly exploring

[44:22 - 44:26]
simpler approaches so what about

[44:24 - 44:28]
fine-tuning versus rag after you've

[44:26 - 44:29]
maximized performance gains from

[44:28 - 44:31]
prompting choosing between Rag and

[44:29 - 44:32]
fine-tuning depends on whether your

[44:31 - 44:34]
model's failures are information based

[44:32 - 44:36]
or behavior-based if the model fails

[44:34 - 44:38]
because it lacks information like

[44:36 - 44:40]
private company data or recent events

[44:38 - 44:41]
rag gives the model better access to

[44:40 - 44:43]
that information if the model has

[44:41 - 44:45]
behavioral issues which I think is very

[44:43 - 44:47]
funny to say like outputs that are

[44:45 - 44:48]
factually correct but irrelevant or

[44:47 - 44:50]
they're in the wrong format fine tuning

[44:48 - 44:52]
might help more if your model has both

[44:50 - 44:54]
issues start with rag because it's

[44:52 - 44:56]
easier begin with a simple term-based

[44:54 - 44:58]
solution and evolve from there in many

[44:56 - 44:59]
cases combining rag and fine tuning will

[44:58 - 45:01]
give you the biggest performance boost

[44:59 - 45:04]
so the workflow to adapt a model to a

[45:01 - 45:06]
task might be first design evaluation

[45:04 - 45:08]
criteria and an evaluation pipeline then

[45:06 - 45:09]
try to get the model to perform the task

[45:08 - 45:11]
with prompting alone add more examples

[45:09 - 45:12]
to the prompt from there at that point

[45:11 - 45:14]
if the model continues to have

[45:12 - 45:16]
information based failures try more

[45:14 - 45:17]
advanced rag like embedding based

[45:16 - 45:19]
retrieval if it continues to have

[45:17 - 45:21]
behavioral issues opt for fine-tuning

[45:19 - 45:23]
finally combine Rag and fine-tuning for

[45:21 - 45:25]
a bigger performance boost because of

[45:23 - 45:27]
the scale of foundation models memory is

[45:25 - 45:28]
a major bottleneck for both inference

[45:27 - 45:30]
and fine tuning the memory requirements

[45:28 - 45:31]
for fine-tuning are typically much

[45:30 - 45:33]
higher than for inference due to how

[45:31 - 45:34]
neural networks are trained neural

[45:33 - 45:36]
networks are typically trained using

[45:34 - 45:38]
back propagation each training step

[45:36 - 45:40]
consists of a forward pass where we

[45:38 - 45:41]
compute the output from the input and a

[45:40 - 45:43]
backwards pass where we update the

[45:41 - 45:45]
model's weights using signals from the

[45:43 - 45:47]
forward pass during inference only the

[45:45 - 45:49]
forward pass is executed during training

[45:47 - 45:51]
both passes are needed the key

[45:49 - 45:52]
contributors to a model's memory

[45:51 - 45:54]
footprint during fine tuning are the

[45:52 - 45:56]
total number of parameters the number of

[45:54 - 45:58]
trainable parameters and the numerical

[45:56 - 45:59]
representation of these parameters a

[45:58 - 46:01]
trainable parameter is one that can be

[45:59 - 46:03]
updated during fine tuning so during

[46:01 - 46:05]
pre-training all model parameters are

[46:03 - 46:08]
updated during inference no parameters

[46:05 - 46:10]
are updated and during fine-tuning some

[46:08 - 46:12]
or all of the parameters may be updated

[46:10 - 46:14]
parameters that remain unchanged are

[46:12 - 46:15]
called Frozen parameters one way to

[46:14 - 46:17]
reduce training memory is through

[46:15 - 46:19]
gradient checkpointing also called

[46:17 - 46:21]
activation recomputation where

[46:19 - 46:23]
activations aren't stored but recomputed

[46:21 - 46:24]
as needed this increases training time

[46:23 - 46:26]
but reduces memory requirements the key

[46:24 - 46:28]
Insight here is that the more trainable

[46:26 - 46:29]
parameters we have the higher the memory

[46:28 - 46:31]
footprint reducing the number of

[46:29 - 46:33]
trainable parameters reduces memory

[46:31 - 46:34]
requirements this is the motivation

[46:33 - 46:36]
behind parameter efficient fine-tuning

[46:34 - 46:37]
which we'll talk about in a bit another

[46:36 - 46:39]
way to reduce the memory footprint is

[46:37 - 46:41]
through quantization converting a model

[46:39 - 46:43]
from a format with more bits to one with

[46:41 - 46:45]
fewer bits for a 13 billion parameter

[46:43 - 46:48]
model using 32-bit floating Point each

[46:45 - 46:51]
parameter requires 4 bytes resulting in

[46:48 - 46:54]
52 GB total so if you reduce each value

[46:51 - 46:57]
to 16 bits the memory needed drops to 26

[46:54 - 46:59]
GB inference is typically done using as

[46:57 - 47:01]
few bits as possible 16 eight or even

[46:59 - 47:03]
four bits training is more sensitive to

[47:01 - 47:05]
numerical Precision so it's usually done

[47:03 - 47:07]
in mixed Precision with some operations

[47:05 - 47:09]
in higher Precision like 32bit and

[47:07 - 47:12]
others in lower Precision like 16 or

[47:09 - 47:14]
8bit different numerical formats balance

[47:12 - 47:16]
range so the span of values that can be

[47:14 - 47:17]
represented and precision how exactly a

[47:16 - 47:19]
number can be represented there are a

[47:17 - 47:21]
few different formats reducing Precision

[47:19 - 47:23]
can cause values to change or result in

[47:21 - 47:25]
errors so it's important to load models

[47:23 - 47:27]
in their intended format for example

[47:25 - 47:29]
when llama 2 is released its weights

[47:27 - 47:32]
optimized for bf16 causing significantly

[47:29 - 47:34]
worse quality when loaded with fp16 now

[47:32 - 47:36]
let's talk about PFT in the early days

[47:34 - 47:38]
of smaller models full fine-tuning so

[47:36 - 47:40]
updating all the model parameters was

[47:38 - 47:41]
common this required a lot of

[47:40 - 47:44]
highquality annotated data and

[47:41 - 47:46]
substantial computational resources as

[47:44 - 47:48]
models grew people started using partial

[47:46 - 47:50]
fine tuning focusing on specific layers

[47:48 - 47:51]
like only the last layer this reduces

[47:50 - 47:53]
memory acquirements but it isn't very

[47:51 - 47:55]
parameter efficient parameter efficient

[47:53 - 47:57]
fine-tuning techniques insert additional

[47:55 - 47:59]
parameters into strategic IC locations

[47:57 - 48:01]
in the model to achieve strong

[47:59 - 48:03]
fine-tuning performance with a small

[48:01 - 48:04]
number of trainable parameters while

[48:03 - 48:07]
this can increase inference latency

[48:04 - 48:09]
slightly as adapters add computational

[48:07 - 48:11]
steps PFT methods are generally not only

[48:09 - 48:13]
parameter efficient but also sample

[48:11 - 48:14]
efficient they can work with just a few

[48:13 - 48:16]
thousand examples compared to the

[48:14 - 48:18]
millions potentially needed for full

[48:16 - 48:20]
fine-tuning PFT methods fall into two

[48:18 - 48:22]
categories so we have adapter-based

[48:20 - 48:24]
methods this is also called additive

[48:22 - 48:26]
methods that add new model weights and

[48:24 - 48:28]
then we have soft prompt based methods

[48:26 - 48:31]
that introduce special trainable tokens

[48:28 - 48:33]
the most popular adapter-based method is

[48:31 - 48:35]
Laura low rank adaptation unlike

[48:33 - 48:37]
traditional adapters Laura incorporates

[48:35 - 48:39]
additional parameters without increasing

[48:37 - 48:41]
inference latency instead of adding new

[48:39 - 48:43]
layers Laura uses modules that can be

[48:41 - 48:45]
merged back into the original layers

[48:43 - 48:46]
Laura works by decomposing weight

[48:45 - 48:48]
matrices into products of smaller

[48:46 - 48:50]
matrices then updating only these

[48:48 - 48:52]
smaller matrices for a weight Matrix

[48:50 - 48:55]
with Dimensions n by m Laura first

[48:52 - 48:57]
chooses a smaller Dimension R the rank

[48:55 - 49:00]
then creates two matrices a which is n

[48:57 - 49:02]
by R and B which is R by m during

[49:00 - 49:04]
fine-tuning only A and B are updated

[49:02 - 49:06]
while the original weights remain Frozen

[49:04 - 49:07]
for inference A and B can be multiplied

[49:06 - 49:09]
together and added to the original

[49:07 - 49:10]
weights the efficiency of Laura depends

[49:09 - 49:13]
both on the chosen Rank and which

[49:10 - 49:14]
matrices it's applied to it's primarily

[49:13 - 49:15]
used for Transformer modules in the

[49:14 - 49:18]
attention modules if you want to

[49:15 - 49:20]
fine-tune a model for multiple tasks you

[49:18 - 49:22]
have several options first simultaneous

[49:20 - 49:24]
fine-tuning training on a data set with

[49:22 - 49:26]
examples from all tasks at once this is

[49:24 - 49:27]
harder and requires more data or you

[49:26 - 49:30]
could do sequen fine tuning where you

[49:27 - 49:31]
first train on task a and then on task B

[49:30 - 49:33]
but this can cause catastrophic

[49:31 - 49:35]
forgetting where the model loses its

[49:33 - 49:38]
ability on earlier tasks or you can try

[49:35 - 49:39]
model merging so there you fine-tune

[49:38 - 49:41]
different tasks separately then combine

[49:39 - 49:43]
the resulting models model merging

[49:41 - 49:45]
offers greater flexibility than fine

[49:43 - 49:46]
tuning alone if you have two models that

[49:45 - 49:48]
excel at different aspects of the same

[49:46 - 49:50]
task you can merge them into a single

[49:48 - 49:52]
model that outperforms both this

[49:50 - 49:54]
approach can be done without gpus it can

[49:52 - 49:55]
improve performance while reducing the

[49:54 - 49:58]
memory footprint it's an excellent

[49:55 - 49:59]
option for on deployment and it can

[49:58 - 50:01]
facilitate Federated learning where

[49:59 - 50:03]
multiple devices train using separate

[50:01 - 50:05]
data unlike ensembling which combines

[50:03 - 50:07]
the outputs of multiple models merging

[50:05 - 50:09]
combines the models themselves this

[50:07 - 50:10]
improves performance without the higher

[50:09 - 50:12]
inference cost of running multiple

[50:10 - 50:14]
models several merging approaches exist

[50:12 - 50:16]
so we have summing where we just add the

[50:14 - 50:17]
weight values of the constituent models

[50:16 - 50:19]
together this is the most common we

[50:17 - 50:20]
could have layer stacking so we take

[50:19 - 50:22]
different layers from different models

[50:20 - 50:24]
and stack them this is also called

[50:22 - 50:26]
Franken merging or concatenation where

[50:24 - 50:27]
we just combine the parameters this is

[50:26 - 50:28]
less recommended because it doesn't

[50:27 - 50:30]
reduce memory compared to separate

[50:28 - 50:32]
models so here's a practical fine-tuning

[50:30 - 50:34]
approach and what a typical development

[50:32 - 50:36]
path might look like first test your

[50:34 - 50:37]
fine-tuning code using the cheapest

[50:36 - 50:39]
fastest model you have and ensure it

[50:37 - 50:41]
works then test your data by fine-tuning

[50:39 - 50:43]
a midsize model if training loss doesn't

[50:41 - 50:45]
decrease with more data something might

[50:43 - 50:47]
be wrong after that run experiments with

[50:45 - 50:49]
your Target Model to see how far you can

[50:47 - 50:50]
push performance and then map the price

[50:49 - 50:52]
performance Frontier and select the

[50:50 - 50:54]
model that makes the most sense for your

[50:52 - 50:56]
use case alternatively a distillation

[50:54 - 50:58]
path looks like this start with a small

[50:56 - 51:00]
data set and the strongest model you can

[50:58 - 51:02]
afford then train the best possible

[51:00 - 51:04]
model with this small data set use this

[51:02 - 51:06]
fine-tune model to generate more

[51:04 - 51:08]
training data use the expanded data set

[51:06 - 51:09]
to train a cheaper model when choosing

[51:08 - 51:11]
fine-tuning methods here are some things

[51:09 - 51:13]
to consider so for beginners start with

[51:11 - 51:15]
adapter techniques like Laura before

[51:13 - 51:17]
attempting full fine tuning understand

[51:15 - 51:19]
that data volume matters full fine

[51:17 - 51:21]
tuning typically requires thousands to

[51:19 - 51:22]
millions of examples while PFT can work

[51:21 - 51:24]
with hundreds also you'll need to know

[51:22 - 51:26]
how many fine tune models you need

[51:24 - 51:27]
adapter methods let you serve multiple

[51:26 - 51:29]
variants that share a base model there

[51:27 - 51:31]
are also some key hyper parameters that

[51:29 - 51:33]
you should know these ones in particular

[51:31 - 51:34]
significantly impact fine-tuning results

[51:33 - 51:35]
so we have the learning rate just like

[51:34 - 51:37]
in machine learning if the loss curve

[51:35 - 51:39]
fluctuates the learning rate is likely

[51:37 - 51:41]
too high if it's stable but decreases

[51:39 - 51:43]
very slowly the rate's probably too low

[51:41 - 51:45]
generally start larger and decrease over

[51:43 - 51:47]
time we also have batch size larger

[51:45 - 51:49]
batches process training examples faster

[51:47 - 51:51]
but require more memory small batches

[51:49 - 51:52]
lead to more unstable training so to

[51:51 - 51:54]
address instability you can accumulate

[51:52 - 51:56]
gradiance across several batches we also

[51:54 - 51:58]
need to think about the number of epoch

[51:56 - 52:00]
smaller data sets typically need more

[51:58 - 52:03]
epochs than larger ones for millions of

[52:00 - 52:05]
examples one to two Epoch might suffice

[52:03 - 52:07]
for thousands of examples 4 to 10 may be

[52:05 - 52:09]
needed reduce Epoch if you see

[52:07 - 52:11]
overfitting we also have prompt loss

[52:09 - 52:12]
weight for instruction fine-tuning this

[52:11 - 52:14]
determines how much prompts should

[52:12 - 52:16]
contribute to the loss compared to the

[52:14 - 52:18]
responses if it's set to 100% prompts

[52:16 - 52:21]
and responses contribute equally if it's

[52:18 - 52:23]
0% the model learns only from responses

[52:21 - 52:24]
the default is typically 10% while the

[52:23 - 52:25]
technical process of fine-tuning has

[52:24 - 52:27]
been simplified by Frameworks that

[52:25 - 52:29]
handle the training process and suggest

[52:27 - 52:31]
sensible defaults the Strategic

[52:29 - 52:33]
decisions around fine-tuning remain

[52:31 - 52:35]
complex the key is knowing when to

[52:33 - 52:36]
fine-tune which technique to use and how

[52:35 - 52:38]
to balance the trade-offs between

[52:36 - 52:40]
performance resources and data

[52:38 - 52:41]
requirements While most companies can't

[52:40 - 52:43]
afford to train Foundation models from

[52:41 - 52:45]
scratch nearly all can differentiate

[52:43 - 52:47]
themselves through high quality data

[52:45 - 52:48]
sets for adaptation as the say goes

[52:47 - 52:50]
garbage in garbage out and nowhere is

[52:48 - 52:51]
this more true than in data set

[52:50 - 52:53]
engineering we're witnessing a shift

[52:51 - 52:55]
from model Centric to data Centric

[52:53 - 52:57]
approaches in AI development model

[52:55 - 52:58]
Centric AI tries to improve performance

[52:57 - 53:00]
by enhancing the models themselves so

[52:58 - 53:02]
designing new architectures increasing

[53:00 - 53:04]
model sizes or developing new training

[53:02 - 53:06]
techniques data Centric AI on the other

[53:04 - 53:07]
hand focuses on improving performance by

[53:06 - 53:09]
enhancing the data developing better

[53:07 - 53:10]
data processing techniques and creating

[53:09 - 53:12]
high quality data sets that allow

[53:10 - 53:14]
Superior models to be trained with fewer

[53:12 - 53:15]
resources for companies adapting

[53:14 - 53:17]
Foundation models rather than building

[53:15 - 53:19]
them from scratch the data Centric

[53:17 - 53:21]
approach offers the greatest competitive

[53:19 - 53:22]
Advantage the type of data you need

[53:21 - 53:24]
depends on your adaptation task for

[53:22 - 53:26]
self-supervised fine-tuning you need

[53:24 - 53:28]
sequences of relevant domain data for

[53:26 - 53:30]
instruction fine tuning you need data in

[53:28 - 53:31]
instruction response format for

[53:30 - 53:33]
preference fine tuning you need

[53:31 - 53:35]
instruction winning response losing

[53:33 - 53:37]
response format for reward modeling you

[53:35 - 53:38]
need either preference data or examples

[53:37 - 53:40]
with explicit scores your training data

[53:38 - 53:41]
should exhibit the behaviors you want

[53:40 - 53:43]
your model to learn this can be

[53:41 - 53:44]
particularly challenging for complex

[53:43 - 53:46]
behaviors like Chain of Thought

[53:44 - 53:47]
reasoning or tool use in agent workflows

[53:46 - 53:49]
When developing conversational

[53:47 - 53:50]
applications you need to consider

[53:49 - 53:53]
whether you require single turn data

[53:50 - 53:54]
multi-turn data or both single turn data

[53:53 - 53:56]
helps train a model to respond to

[53:54 - 53:57]
individual instructions while multi-turn

[53:56 - 53:59]
data data teaches the model how to solve

[53:57 - 54:01]
tasks through dialogue like clarifying

[53:59 - 54:03]
user intent before addressing the task

[54:01 - 54:04]
or incorporating Corrections a small

[54:03 - 54:06]
amount of high quality data can

[54:04 - 54:08]
outperform a large amount of noisy data

[54:06 - 54:10]
a principle confirmed by teams working

[54:08 - 54:11]
on models like llama 3 they found that

[54:10 - 54:13]
human generated data is often prone to

[54:11 - 54:16]
errors in inconsistencies particularly

[54:13 - 54:18]
for nuanced policies leading them to

[54:16 - 54:19]
develop AI assisted annotation tools to

[54:18 - 54:21]
ensure high quality which is interesting

[54:19 - 54:23]
to me but what makes data high quality

[54:21 - 54:25]
there are several factors to consider

[54:23 - 54:27]
first relevance the examples should be

[54:25 - 54:28]
relevant to your target task legal text

[54:27 - 54:30]
from the 19th century might not be

[54:28 - 54:31]
relevant for answering contemporary

[54:30 - 54:33]
legal questions you'll also need

[54:31 - 54:36]
alignment with task requirements if your

[54:33 - 54:38]
task focuses on factual consistency

[54:36 - 54:40]
annotations need to be factually correct

[54:38 - 54:41]
if it demands creativity annotations

[54:40 - 54:43]
should be creative we also need to think

[54:41 - 54:45]
about consistency annotations should be

[54:43 - 54:46]
consistent across examples and

[54:45 - 54:48]
annotators they need to be correctly

[54:46 - 54:50]
formatted so data should adhere to the

[54:48 - 54:52]
expected structure they need to be

[54:50 - 54:53]
sufficiently unique you want minimal

[54:52 - 54:55]
duplicates in your data set they need to

[54:53 - 54:57]
be compliant and follow internal and

[54:55 - 54:59]
external policies and you need coverage

[54:57 - 55:01]
your training data needs to cover the

[54:59 - 55:03]
range of possible problems you want to

[55:01 - 55:04]
solve requiring sufficient diversity

[55:03 - 55:06]
missing coverage in important areas will

[55:04 - 55:07]
result in poor performance for those

[55:06 - 55:09]
cases no matter how much data you have

[55:07 - 55:11]
overall but how much data do you need

[55:09 - 55:13]
asking how much data you need is kind of

[55:11 - 55:14]
like asking how much money you need the

[55:13 - 55:16]
answer varies widely depending on your

[55:14 - 55:18]
situation several factors influence data

[55:16 - 55:20]
requirements so if you're fine-tuning

[55:18 - 55:22]
then the fine-tuning technique matters

[55:20 - 55:23]
full fine tuning typically requires

[55:22 - 55:25]
orders of magnitude more data than

[55:23 - 55:27]
parameter efficient methods like Laura

[55:25 - 55:29]
with tens of thousands to millions of

[55:27 - 55:31]
examples full fine tuning might be

[55:29 - 55:33]
appropriate with just hundreds to a few

[55:31 - 55:35]
thousand examples PFT methods will

[55:33 - 55:37]
likely work better it also depends on

[55:35 - 55:39]
your task complexity a simple sentiment

[55:37 - 55:41]
classification task requires much less

[55:39 - 55:43]
data than complex question answering

[55:41 - 55:44]
about financial filings for example the

[55:43 - 55:46]
base model performance also makes a

[55:44 - 55:48]
difference so the closer the base model

[55:46 - 55:50]
is to your desired performance the fewer

[55:48 - 55:51]
examples you'll need larger more capable

[55:50 - 55:53]
base models generally require fewer

[55:51 - 55:55]
examples to fine-tune effectively open

[55:53 - 55:57]
ai's fine-tuning guide demonstrates that

[55:55 - 55:59]
with fewer examples around 100 more

[55:57 - 56:02]
advanced models give better fine-tuning

[55:59 - 56:05]
results however after fine-tuning on a

[56:02 - 56:07]
large data set around 550,000 examples

[56:05 - 56:09]
all models perform similarly regardless

[56:07 - 56:12]
of their initial capabilities so in

[56:09 - 56:14]
short with limited data use PFT methods

[56:12 - 56:16]
on more advanced models with abundant

[56:14 - 56:17]
data full fine tuning on smaller models

[56:16 - 56:19]
becomes viable before investing in a

[56:17 - 56:22]
large data set start with a small

[56:19 - 56:23]
well-crafted set of around 50 examples

[56:22 - 56:25]
to see if fine tuning improves your

[56:23 - 56:26]
model if you see clear improvements more

[56:25 - 56:28]
data will likely help further if you see

[56:26 - 56:30]
no improvement with a small data set a

[56:28 - 56:31]
larger one rarely solves the problem

[56:30 - 56:33]
though be careful to rule out other

[56:31 - 56:35]
issues like poor hyperparameters or data

[56:33 - 56:37]
quality first in most cases you should

[56:35 - 56:40]
see improvements after fine-tuning with

[56:37 - 56:41]
just 50 to 100 examples you can also

[56:40 - 56:43]
reduce the amount of high quality data

[56:41 - 56:45]
you need by first fine-tuning on more

[56:43 - 56:47]
accessible data so One path might be

[56:45 - 56:49]
self-supervised to supervised first

[56:47 - 56:51]
fine-tune on domain specific documents

[56:49 - 56:53]
then on targeted question answer pairs

[56:51 - 56:55]
or less relevant to more relevant data

[56:53 - 56:57]
first fine tune on adjacent domains with

[56:55 - 56:59]
abundant data then on your specific

[56:57 - 57:02]
domain or synthetic to real data first

[56:59 - 57:04]
find- tune on AI generated examples then

[57:02 - 57:06]
on limited real examples experimenting

[57:04 - 57:09]
with subsets of your current data set so

[57:06 - 57:11]
maybe 25 50 and 100% can help estimate

[57:09 - 57:12]
how much more data you'll need a steep

[57:11 - 57:14]
performance gain with increasing data

[57:12 - 57:16]
set size suggests significant

[57:14 - 57:18]
improvement from doubling your data a

[57:16 - 57:19]
plateau indicates diminishing returns so

[57:18 - 57:21]
let's say you need more data how can you

[57:19 - 57:22]
get it if you don't have enough for your

[57:21 - 57:24]
use case if possible you'll want to

[57:22 - 57:26]
create a data flywheel that leverages

[57:24 - 57:28]
user interactions to continue ually

[57:26 - 57:30]
improve your product this offers a

[57:28 - 57:31]
significant competitive advantage or you

[57:30 - 57:33]
could also just check available data

[57:31 - 57:35]
sets you can often mix and match

[57:33 - 57:37]
different sources though all data must

[57:35 - 57:38]
be thoroughly verified for quality and

[57:37 - 57:40]
appropriate licensing when annotating

[57:38 - 57:42]
your own data the challenge isn't just

[57:40 - 57:44]
The annotation process but creating

[57:42 - 57:46]
clear guidelines you need to explicitly

[57:44 - 57:48]
Define what makes a good response can a

[57:46 - 57:51]
response be correct but unhelpful what

[57:48 - 57:52]
distinguishes a score of three versus 4

[57:51 - 57:55]
these guidelines are crucial both for

[57:52 - 57:56]
human and AI powered annotations trust

[57:55 - 57:58]
me one of the hard machine learning

[57:56 - 58:00]
problems I've ever had to solve was an

[57:58 - 58:02]
issue with human labelers data

[58:00 - 58:04]
augmentation creates new examples from

[58:02 - 58:05]
existing data which is another option so

[58:04 - 58:06]
you could do things like flipping an

[58:05 - 58:09]
image to create a new variant or you

[58:06 - 58:11]
could use data synthesis this generates

[58:09 - 58:12]
artificial data that mimics real data

[58:11 - 58:14]
properties like simulating Mouse

[58:12 - 58:16]
movements on a web page the key

[58:14 - 58:18]
difference between augmented data and

[58:16 - 58:20]
synthetic data is that augmented data is

[58:18 - 58:22]
derived from real data while synthetic

[58:20 - 58:23]
data is Created from scratch data

[58:22 - 58:25]
synthesis therefore is particularly

[58:23 - 58:27]
valuable for addressing privacy concerns

[58:25 - 58:29]
when working with sensitive information

[58:27 - 58:30]
together some combination of these

[58:29 - 58:32]
techniques should allow you to produce

[58:30 - 58:34]
data at scale increase coverage across

[58:32 - 58:36]
your problem space and possibly improve

[58:34 - 58:38]
quality with AI generated data since

[58:36 - 58:39]
humans aren't always great at creating

[58:38 - 58:41]
consistent data but of course make sure

[58:39 - 58:42]
to measure the quality of your AI

[58:41 - 58:44]
generated data just like you would for

[58:42 - 58:46]
human generated data once you have your

[58:44 - 58:48]
data you need to process it data

[58:46 - 58:50]
processing can be timec consuming but it

[58:48 - 58:52]
is critical for Quality here are some

[58:50 - 58:54]
best practices start with filtering

[58:52 - 58:56]
tasks and test scripts before big runs

[58:54 - 58:58]
avoid changing data in place so you want

[58:56 - 59:00]
to make sure to keep the originals

[58:58 - 59:02]
perform exploratory data analysis on

[59:00 - 59:04]
distributions and outliers examine

[59:02 - 59:06]
interannotator disagreement and resolve

[59:04 - 59:08]
conflicts fact check and manually

[59:06 - 59:10]
inspect examples D duplicate data to

[59:08 - 59:13]
prevent over representation clean

[59:10 - 59:14]
formatting tokens like HTML and markdown

[59:13 - 59:17]
which can improve performance and reduce

[59:14 - 59:19]
input size remove non-compliant data so

[59:17 - 59:20]
anything like pii toxic material or

[59:19 - 59:22]
copyrighted content filter out

[59:20 - 59:24]
lowquality data identified during

[59:22 - 59:26]
verification if you have more data than

[59:24 - 59:27]
your compute budget allows use active

[59:26 - 59:29]
learning to select the most helpful

[59:27 - 59:31]
examples and ensure data is in the right

[59:29 - 59:33]
format for your model using the

[59:31 - 59:35]
appropriate tokenizer and chat template

[59:33 - 59:36]
while all these steps require a lot of

[59:35 - 59:38]
effort they're essential for creating

[59:36 - 59:40]
data sets that will help your model to

[59:38 - 59:42]
shine in the competitive landscape of AI

[59:40 - 59:43]
applications well-engineered data sets

[59:42 - 59:45]
often make the difference between

[59:43 - 59:46]
mediocre and exceptional performance now

[59:45 - 59:48]
let's dive into one of the most

[59:46 - 59:50]
practical aspects of AI engineering

[59:48 - 59:52]
inference optimization after all a

[59:50 - 59:55]
model's real world usefulness boils down

[59:52 - 59:57]
to two crucial factors how much it costs

[59:55 - 59:59]
to run and how quick quickly it responds

[59:57 - 01:00:01]
these characteristics inference cost and

[59:59 - 01:00:02]
latency ultimately determine which

[01:00:01 - 01:00:04]
applications can practically use Ai and

[01:00:02 - 01:00:05]
at what scale let's start by

[01:00:04 - 01:00:07]
understanding what we mean by inference

[01:00:05 - 01:00:10]
in the AI life cycle there are two

[01:00:07 - 01:00:11]
distinct phases in an AI model's Journey

[01:00:10 - 01:00:13]
training and inference training builds

[01:00:11 - 01:00:15]
the model while inference uses the model

[01:00:13 - 01:00:17]
to compute outputs for given inputs in a

[01:00:15 - 01:00:18]
production environment the component

[01:00:17 - 01:00:20]
responsible for running the model

[01:00:18 - 01:00:22]
inference is called an inference server

[01:00:20 - 01:00:24]
This Server hosts available models

[01:00:22 - 01:00:27]
allocates Hardware resources to execute

[01:00:24 - 01:00:28]
them and returns responses to users the

[01:00:27 - 01:00:30]
inference server is part of a broader

[01:00:28 - 01:00:32]
inference service that also handles

[01:00:30 - 01:00:34]
receiving routing and pre-processing

[01:00:32 - 01:00:36]
requests so what does this mean for you

[01:00:34 - 01:00:37]
well if you're using a model API like

[01:00:36 - 01:00:39]
those from open aai or Google you're

[01:00:37 - 01:00:41]
essentially Outsourcing this inference

[01:00:39 - 01:00:43]
service but if you decide to host models

[01:00:41 - 01:00:45]
yourself you'll need to build optimize

[01:00:43 - 01:00:47]
and maintain your own inference

[01:00:45 - 01:00:48]
infrastructure to optimize inference we

[01:00:47 - 01:00:51]
first need to understand what's slowing

[01:00:48 - 01:00:53]
things down generally speaking AI

[01:00:51 - 01:00:55]
workloads face two types of bottlenecks

[01:00:53 - 01:00:56]
compute bound bottlenecks occur when the

[01:00:55 - 01:00:59]
limiting factor is the computational

[01:00:56 - 01:01:00]
power available tasks requiring

[01:00:59 - 01:01:02]
intensive calculations like image

[01:01:00 - 01:01:04]
generation are typically compute bound

[01:01:02 - 01:01:06]
memory bandwidth bound bottlenecks occur

[01:01:04 - 01:01:07]
when the limiting factor is how quickly

[01:01:06 - 01:01:09]
data can move between memory and

[01:01:07 - 01:01:11]
processors autor regressive language

[01:01:09 - 01:01:13]
model inference is typically memory

[01:01:11 - 01:01:14]
bandwidth bound profiling tools like

[01:01:13 - 01:01:16]
Nvidia Insight can help determine which

[01:01:14 - 01:01:18]
bottleneck affects your workload through

[01:01:16 - 01:01:19]
something called a roofline chart what's

[01:01:18 - 01:01:20]
important to understand is that

[01:01:19 - 01:01:22]
different optimization Techniques

[01:01:20 - 01:01:24]
address different bottlenecks a compute

[01:01:22 - 01:01:26]
bound workload might benefit from more

[01:01:24 - 01:01:27]
powerful chips or Distributing work

[01:01:26 - 01:01:29]
across multiple chips meanwhile a memory

[01:01:27 - 01:01:30]
bandwidth bound workload might see

[01:01:29 - 01:01:32]
better results from chips with higher

[01:01:30 - 01:01:33]
memory bandwidth now that we understand

[01:01:32 - 01:01:36]
bottlenecks let's look at how inference

[01:01:33 - 01:01:38]
is actually served many providers often

[01:01:36 - 01:01:40]
two distinct types of inference apis

[01:01:38 - 01:01:42]
each optimized for different use cases

[01:01:40 - 01:01:43]
online apis optimize for Laten see

[01:01:42 - 01:01:46]
processing requests as soon as they

[01:01:43 - 01:01:48]
arrive chatbots typically use online

[01:01:46 - 01:01:50]
apis since users expect quick responses

[01:01:48 - 01:01:52]
batch apis on the other hand optimize

[01:01:50 - 01:01:53]
for cost processing multiple requests

[01:01:52 - 01:01:55]
together more efficiently but with

[01:01:53 - 01:01:56]
higher latency applications without

[01:01:55 - 01:01:58]
strict resp response time requirements

[01:01:56 - 01:02:00]
like periodic report generation or

[01:01:58 - 01:02:02]
synthetic data creation can benefit from

[01:02:00 - 01:02:04]
batch processing the key is matching

[01:02:02 - 01:02:06]
your inference type to your applications

[01:02:04 - 01:02:07]
needs so now how do we measure if our

[01:02:06 - 01:02:10]
inference is performing well that brings

[01:02:07 - 01:02:12]
us to our next section here are some key

[01:02:10 - 01:02:13]
inference performance metrics to

[01:02:12 - 01:02:15]
optimize effectively we need to know

[01:02:13 - 01:02:17]
what we're measuring several metrics

[01:02:15 - 01:02:18]
help us evaluate inference performance

[01:02:17 - 01:02:20]
the first and perhaps most notable

[01:02:18 - 01:02:22]
metric is latency the time from when

[01:02:20 - 01:02:24]
users send a query until they receive a

[01:02:22 - 01:02:26]
complete response for autor regressive

[01:02:24 - 01:02:28]
models like llms latency break down into

[01:02:26 - 01:02:31]
two components so we have the time to

[01:02:28 - 01:02:33]
First token ttft which is how quickly

[01:02:31 - 01:02:35]
the first token is generated after

[01:02:33 - 01:02:38]
receiving a query and then we have time

[01:02:35 - 01:02:41]
per output token tpot toot how long it

[01:02:38 - 01:02:44]
takes to generate each subsequent token

[01:02:41 - 01:02:46]
the total latency then equals ttft plus

[01:02:44 - 01:02:48]
toot time the number of output tokens

[01:02:46 - 01:02:51]
some teams also measure time to publish

[01:02:48 - 01:02:53]
TTP because the first generated token

[01:02:51 - 01:02:54]
isn't always immediately shown to users

[01:02:53 - 01:02:55]
especially when the model first

[01:02:54 - 01:02:57]
generates a plan or uses Chain of

[01:02:55 - 01:02:59]
Thought reasoning one important note

[01:02:57 - 01:03:01]
about latency since it varies across

[01:02:59 - 01:03:02]
requests looking at percentiles gives

[01:03:01 - 01:03:05]
you much more meaningful information

[01:03:02 - 01:03:07]
than simple averages Beyond latency we

[01:03:05 - 01:03:08]
also care about throughput which is the

[01:03:07 - 01:03:10]
number of output tokens per second an

[01:03:08 - 01:03:12]
inference service can generate across

[01:03:10 - 01:03:14]
all requests higher throughput typically

[01:03:12 - 01:03:16]
means lower cost which is why optimizing

[01:03:14 - 01:03:17]
for it matters for production systems

[01:03:16 - 01:03:19]
it's worth mentioning that most AI

[01:03:17 - 01:03:20]
applications face a fundamental latency

[01:03:19 - 01:03:22]
throughput tradeoff techniques like

[01:03:20 - 01:03:24]
batching can improve through put but may

[01:03:22 - 01:03:25]
increase latency for individual requests

[01:03:24 - 01:03:27]
your optimization strategy needs to

[01:03:25 - 01:03:29]
balance these competing priorities based

[01:03:27 - 01:03:31]
on your specific application needs

[01:03:29 - 01:03:33]
finally utilization metrics tell us how

[01:03:31 - 01:03:35]
efficiently we're using our resources we

[01:03:33 - 01:03:36]
have model flops per second utilization

[01:03:35 - 01:03:38]
which is the ratio of observed

[01:03:36 - 01:03:40]
throughput relative to the theoretical

[01:03:38 - 01:03:42]
maximum at Peak computing power model

[01:03:40 - 01:03:44]
bandwidth utilization which measures the

[01:03:42 - 01:03:45]
percentage of available memory bandwidth

[01:03:44 - 01:03:46]
being used now that we know what to

[01:03:45 - 01:03:48]
measure let's look at the hardware that

[01:03:46 - 01:03:50]
powers inference at the heart of

[01:03:48 - 01:03:52]
inference performance is specialized

[01:03:50 - 01:03:53]
Hardware an accelerator is a chip

[01:03:52 - 01:03:55]
designed to speed up specific types of

[01:03:53 - 01:03:58]
computation for AI workloads the

[01:03:55 - 01:03:59]
dominant accelerators are gpus those

[01:03:58 - 01:04:01]
specialized AI chips are growing in

[01:03:59 - 01:04:03]
popularity you might be wondering about

[01:04:01 - 01:04:05]
the difference between CPUs and gpus it

[01:04:03 - 01:04:07]
comes down to their architecture CPUs

[01:04:05 - 01:04:09]
have a few powerful cores typically up

[01:04:07 - 01:04:11]
to 64 for high-end machines which are

[01:04:09 - 01:04:13]
optimized for general purpose Computing

[01:04:11 - 01:04:15]
gpus on the other hand have thousands of

[01:04:13 - 01:04:17]
smaller cores optimized for parallel

[01:04:15 - 01:04:19]
processing this makes them ideal for

[01:04:17 - 01:04:21]
matrix multiplication operations that

[01:04:19 - 01:04:22]
dominate ml workloads interestingly

[01:04:21 - 01:04:24]
training and inference have different

[01:04:22 - 01:04:26]
Hardware requirements training demands

[01:04:24 - 01:04:28]
more memory due to back prop and is

[01:04:26 - 01:04:29]
generally more difficult to perform and

[01:04:28 - 01:04:31]
lower Precision inference often

[01:04:29 - 01:04:32]
emphasizes latency over throughput since

[01:04:31 - 01:04:34]
users are typically waiting for

[01:04:32 - 01:04:37]
responses when evaluating hardware for

[01:04:34 - 01:04:38]
inference consider three key questions

[01:04:37 - 01:04:40]
can it run your workloads how long does

[01:04:38 - 01:04:42]
it take to do so and how much does it

[01:04:40 - 01:04:44]
cost the specific Hardware

[01:04:42 - 01:04:46]
specifications to focus on include flops

[01:04:44 - 01:04:48]
computing power memory size and memory

[01:04:46 - 01:04:50]
bandwidth for compute bound workloads

[01:04:48 - 01:04:52]
prioritize chips with more flops for

[01:04:50 - 01:04:53]
memory bound workloads focus on higher

[01:04:52 - 01:04:55]
bandwidth and more memory with the

[01:04:53 - 01:04:56]
hardware foundations covered let's move

[01:04:55 - 01:04:58]
on to techniques for optimizing at the

[01:04:56 - 01:05:00]
model level now we're getting into the

[01:04:58 - 01:05:01]
real tactics for speeding up inference

[01:05:00 - 01:05:03]
let's start with model level

[01:05:01 - 01:05:05]
optimizations techniques that make the

[01:05:03 - 01:05:07]
models themselves more efficient model

[01:05:05 - 01:05:09]
compression reduces a model's size

[01:05:07 - 01:05:11]
potentially making it faster there are

[01:05:09 - 01:05:12]
several approaches here quantization

[01:05:11 - 01:05:15]
which we already discussed reduces

[01:05:12 - 01:05:16]
numerical Precision pruning removes less

[01:05:15 - 01:05:18]
important parameters or sets them to

[01:05:16 - 01:05:20]
zero and distillation which we also

[01:05:18 - 01:05:22]
already discussed trains a smaller model

[01:05:20 - 01:05:24]
to mimic a larger one among these

[01:05:22 - 01:05:25]
options weight only quantization is by

[01:05:24 - 01:05:27]
far the most popular because it's

[01:05:25 - 01:05:28]
relatively easy to implement works well

[01:05:27 - 01:05:30]
for many models out of the box and

[01:05:28 - 01:05:31]
delivers significant benefits without

[01:05:30 - 01:05:33]
that much effort another challenge

[01:05:31 - 01:05:34]
specific to language models is their

[01:05:33 - 01:05:37]
autor regressive nature they generate

[01:05:34 - 01:05:38]
text one token at a time which creates a

[01:05:37 - 01:05:40]
sequential bottleneck several Techniques

[01:05:38 - 01:05:42]
address this limitation speculative

[01:05:40 - 01:05:45]
decoding uses a faster but less powerful

[01:05:42 - 01:05:47]
model to generate candidate tokens which

[01:05:45 - 01:05:48]
are then verified by the Target Model

[01:05:47 - 01:05:50]
it's like having an assistant draft

[01:05:48 - 01:05:52]
responses and a manager quickly review

[01:05:50 - 01:05:53]
and approve inference with reference

[01:05:52 - 01:05:55]
copies tokens from the input when

[01:05:53 - 01:05:56]
appropriate for example when answering

[01:05:55 - 01:05:58]
questions about about a document rather

[01:05:56 - 01:06:00]
than generating them from scratch this

[01:05:58 - 01:06:02]
can significantly speed up responses for

[01:06:00 - 01:06:04]
document-based queries parallel decoding

[01:06:02 - 01:06:06]
aims to generate multiple tokens

[01:06:04 - 01:06:08]
simultaneously breaking the sequential

[01:06:06 - 01:06:09]
constraint additionally attention

[01:06:08 - 01:06:11]
mechanism optimization improves the

[01:06:09 - 01:06:13]
efficiency of Transformer models

[01:06:11 - 01:06:15]
attention calculations which can be

[01:06:13 - 01:06:17]
particularly memory intensive at an even

[01:06:15 - 01:06:19]
lower level kernels and compilers

[01:06:17 - 01:06:21]
optimize how models run on specific

[01:06:19 - 01:06:23]
Hardware kernels are specialized code

[01:06:21 - 01:06:25]
optimized for Hardware accelerators

[01:06:23 - 01:06:27]
common optimization techniques include

[01:06:25 - 01:06:29]
vectorization a parallelization loop

[01:06:27 - 01:06:31]
tiling and operator Fusion compilers

[01:06:29 - 01:06:33]
Bridge machine learning models and

[01:06:31 - 01:06:34]
Hardware converting model operations

[01:06:33 - 01:06:36]
into optimized code for specific

[01:06:34 - 01:06:38]
accelerators but optimization doesn't

[01:06:36 - 01:06:40]
stop at the model level let's look at

[01:06:38 - 01:06:42]
how we can optimize the entire inference

[01:06:40 - 01:06:43]
service we can achieve significant

[01:06:42 - 01:06:45]
performance gains by efficiently

[01:06:43 - 01:06:46]
managing resources across an entire

[01:06:45 - 01:06:48]
inference service one of the most

[01:06:46 - 01:06:50]
powerful techniques is batching which

[01:06:48 - 01:06:52]
combines multiple requests process

[01:06:50 - 01:06:53]
together batching can be implemented in

[01:06:52 - 01:06:55]
different ways so we have static

[01:06:53 - 01:06:58]
batching which groups a fixed number of

[01:06:55 - 01:06:59]
inputs but all requests must wait until

[01:06:58 - 01:07:01]
the batch is full this is simple but can

[01:06:59 - 01:07:03]
lead to inconsistent latency Dynamic

[01:07:01 - 01:07:05]
batching sets a maximum time window

[01:07:03 - 01:07:07]
processing the batch when either it's

[01:07:05 - 01:07:09]
full or the time limit has been reached

[01:07:07 - 01:07:11]
this provides more consistent latency

[01:07:09 - 01:07:13]
guarantees finally we have continuous

[01:07:11 - 01:07:14]
batching which allows responses to be

[01:07:13 - 01:07:16]
returned as soon as they're completed

[01:07:14 - 01:07:18]
with new requests added to maintain

[01:07:16 - 01:07:20]
batch size this provides the best user

[01:07:18 - 01:07:22]
experience but is more complex to

[01:07:20 - 01:07:24]
implement another powerful technique is

[01:07:22 - 01:07:25]
decoupled prefill and decode which

[01:07:24 - 01:07:27]
separates these two phases of of llm

[01:07:25 - 01:07:29]
inference since they have different

[01:07:27 - 01:07:30]
computational needs handling them

[01:07:29 - 01:07:32]
separately prevents resource competition

[01:07:30 - 01:07:34]
and improves overall efficiency for

[01:07:32 - 01:07:36]
applications with repetitive patterns

[01:07:34 - 01:07:38]
prompt caching stores overlapping text

[01:07:36 - 01:07:39]
segments like system prompts or

[01:07:38 - 01:07:41]
reference documents to avoid

[01:07:39 - 01:07:43]
reprocessing them with each query this

[01:07:41 - 01:07:44]
is particularly valuable for

[01:07:43 - 01:07:46]
applications with long conversations or

[01:07:44 - 01:07:48]
multiple queries about the same document

[01:07:46 - 01:07:50]
as models grow larger a single machine

[01:07:48 - 01:07:52]
may not be sufficient this is where

[01:07:50 - 01:07:54]
parallelism comes in distributing work

[01:07:52 - 01:07:56]
across multiple machines replica

[01:07:54 - 01:07:57]
parallelism creates m multiple copies of

[01:07:56 - 01:07:59]
the model each handling different

[01:07:57 - 01:08:00]
requests this is the simplest approach

[01:07:59 - 01:08:02]
and works well for high throughput

[01:08:00 - 01:08:04]
scenarios model parallelism splits a

[01:08:02 - 01:08:06]
single model across machines either

[01:08:04 - 01:08:08]
through tensor parallelism which is

[01:08:06 - 01:08:10]
breaking operations into smaller pieces

[01:08:08 - 01:08:12]
pipeline parallelism dividing the model

[01:08:10 - 01:08:14]
into sequential stages context

[01:08:12 - 01:08:17]
parallelism splitting input sequences

[01:08:14 - 01:08:18]
across devices or sequence parallelism

[01:08:17 - 01:08:20]
splitting different operations across

[01:08:18 - 01:08:22]
machines so what technique should you

[01:08:20 - 01:08:23]
implement we just talked about a lot the

[01:08:22 - 01:08:25]
optimal combination depends on your

[01:08:23 - 01:08:26]
specific workloads and performance

[01:08:25 - 01:08:28]
requir ments for applications

[01:08:26 - 01:08:30]
prioritizing low latency replica

[01:08:28 - 01:08:32]
parallelism may be best despite higher

[01:08:30 - 01:08:34]
costs for most use cases the most

[01:08:32 - 01:08:36]
impactful techniques are typically

[01:08:34 - 01:08:38]
quantization tensor parallelism replica

[01:08:36 - 01:08:40]
parallelism and attention mechanism

[01:08:38 - 01:08:42]
optimization by thoughtfully applying

[01:08:40 - 01:08:43]
these techniques you can dramatically

[01:08:42 - 01:08:45]
improve both the speed and cost

[01:08:43 - 01:08:46]
effectiveness of your AI applications

[01:08:45 - 01:08:48]
making them more responsive to users

[01:08:46 - 01:08:50]
while keeping your infrastructure cost

[01:08:48 - 01:08:52]
manageable in our next and final section

[01:08:50 - 01:08:53]
we'll see how all these components come

[01:08:52 - 01:08:55]
together in a complete AI application

[01:08:53 - 01:08:57]
architecture and how user your feedback

[01:08:55 - 01:08:59]
creates a virtuous cycle of continuous

[01:08:57 - 01:09:00]
Improvement now that we've explored all

[01:08:59 - 01:09:02]
the individual components of AI

[01:09:00 - 01:09:04]
engineering it's time to pull everything

[01:09:02 - 01:09:05]
together let's see how these pieces fit

[01:09:04 - 01:09:07]
into a complete architecture and how

[01:09:05 - 01:09:09]
user feedback creates a powerful Loop

[01:09:07 - 01:09:10]
that helps these systems improve over

[01:09:09 - 01:09:12]
time the simplest AI application

[01:09:10 - 01:09:14]
architecture looks like this your

[01:09:12 - 01:09:15]
application receives a query sends it to

[01:09:14 - 01:09:18]
a model either through a third party API

[01:09:15 - 01:09:19]
or self-hosted model and Returns the

[01:09:18 - 01:09:21]
response to the user no Bells no

[01:09:19 - 01:09:23]
whistles just direct input and output

[01:09:21 - 01:09:25]
but real world applications rarely stay

[01:09:23 - 01:09:27]
this simple let's walk through how these

[01:09:25 - 01:09:29]
architectures typically evolve as your

[01:09:27 - 01:09:31]
needs grow more sophisticated the first

[01:09:29 - 01:09:33]
enhancement most applications need is

[01:09:31 - 01:09:35]
better context construction giving the

[01:09:33 - 01:09:37]
model access to information required to

[01:09:35 - 01:09:38]
process useful outputs this is

[01:09:37 - 01:09:41]
essentially feature engineering for

[01:09:38 - 01:09:42]
foundation models so you might add rag

[01:09:41 - 01:09:44]
systems to search and retrieve

[01:09:42 - 01:09:45]
information from your knowledge base

agent capabilities to gather information

[01:09:45 - 01:09:49]
from external tools document uploading

[01:09:48 - 01:09:51]
functionality to analyze specific

[01:09:49 - 01:09:53]
content or more these additions ensure

[01:09:51 - 01:09:55]
the model has the necessary context to

[01:09:53 - 01:09:58]
provide accurate relevant responses step

[01:09:55 - 01:09:59]
two add guard rails for protection as

[01:09:58 - 01:10:01]
your application grows in capability

[01:09:59 - 01:10:03]
you'll need guard rails to protect both

[01:10:01 - 01:10:04]
your system and your users input guard

[01:10:03 - 01:10:07]
rails protect against leaking private

[01:10:04 - 01:10:08]
information to external apis and

[01:10:07 - 01:10:10]
malicious prompts that could compromise

[01:10:08 - 01:10:12]
your system output guard rails catch

[01:10:10 - 01:10:14]
different types of failures quality

[01:10:12 - 01:10:16]
failures like empty responses incorrect

[01:10:14 - 01:10:18]
formatting or factually incorrect

[01:10:16 - 01:10:20]
content or security failures like toxic

[01:10:18 - 01:10:22]
content pii exposure or unauthorized

[01:10:20 - 01:10:24]
actions the key again is balancing

[01:10:22 - 01:10:25]
protection with user experience overly

[01:10:24 - 01:10:27]
restrictive guardrails create

[01:10:25 - 01:10:29]
frustrating experiences while inadequate

[01:10:27 - 01:10:31]
ones could leave you vulnerable stage

[01:10:29 - 01:10:33]
three Implement model routing and

[01:10:31 - 01:10:35]
gateways as your application matures you

[01:10:33 - 01:10:37]
may discover that one model doesn't fit

[01:10:35 - 01:10:39]
all your needs different queries require

[01:10:37 - 01:10:41]
different approaches and this is where

[01:10:39 - 01:10:42]
model routing comes into play a model

[01:10:41 - 01:10:44]
router typically includes an intent

[01:10:42 - 01:10:46]
classifier that predicts what the user

[01:10:44 - 01:10:47]
is trying to do and then directs the

[01:10:46 - 01:10:49]
query to the appropriate model or

[01:10:47 - 01:10:51]
pipeline these routers should be fast

[01:10:49 - 01:10:52]
and inexpensive so you can use multiple

[01:10:51 - 01:10:54]
of them without adding significant

[01:10:52 - 01:10:57]
latency or cost along with routing

[01:10:54 - 01:10:59]
you'll need a model Gateway this is an

[01:10:57 - 01:11:01]
intermediate layer that provides a

[01:10:59 - 01:11:03]
unified interface to different models

[01:11:01 - 01:11:05]
both self-hosted and Commercial access

[01:11:03 - 01:11:07]
control and cost management fallback

[01:11:05 - 01:11:09]
policies to handle rate limits or API

[01:11:07 - 01:11:11]
failures and load balancing logging and

[01:11:09 - 01:11:13]
analytics the Gateway approach makes

[01:11:11 - 01:11:15]
your codebase much more maintainable if

[01:11:13 - 01:11:17]
a model API changes you only need to

[01:11:15 - 01:11:19]
update the Gateway not every application

[01:11:17 - 01:11:21]
that uses it it's a classic example of

[01:11:19 - 01:11:23]
separations of concerns in software

[01:11:21 - 01:11:25]
engineering next stage four optimize

[01:11:23 - 01:11:27]
with caching as your user based grow

[01:11:25 - 01:11:29]
performance and cost optimization become

[01:11:27 - 01:11:30]
increasingly important this is where

[01:11:29 - 01:11:32]
caching enters the picture inference

[01:11:30 - 01:11:34]
caching includes techniques like KV

[01:11:32 - 01:11:36]
caching to optimize the attention

[01:11:34 - 01:11:38]
mechanism and prompt caching to avoid

[01:11:36 - 01:11:40]
reprocessing identical prompt components

[01:11:38 - 01:11:41]
caching is particularly valuable for

[01:11:40 - 01:11:43]
multi-step processes like Chain of

[01:11:41 - 01:11:44]
Thought reasoning or queries requiring

[01:11:43 - 01:11:46]
timec consuming actions like retrieval

[01:11:44 - 01:11:48]
or web searches for implementation your

[01:11:46 - 01:11:50]
options range from in-memory storage

[01:11:48 - 01:11:52]
which is fast but has limited capacity

[01:11:50 - 01:11:54]
to databases like postgress SQL and

[01:11:52 - 01:11:57]
reddis you'll also need an eviction

[01:11:54 - 01:11:59]
policy like least recently used or least

[01:11:57 - 01:12:01]
frequently used to manage cache sizes as

[01:11:59 - 01:12:03]
you scale stage five add complex logic

[01:12:01 - 01:12:06]
and write actions this is the most

[01:12:03 - 01:12:08]
sophisticated AI applications go beyond

[01:12:06 - 01:12:10]
simple question answering to incorporate

[01:12:08 - 01:12:11]
complex multi-step reasoning flows

[01:12:10 - 01:12:13]
agentic patterns with loops and

[01:12:11 - 01:12:15]
decision-making and write actions that

[01:12:13 - 01:12:17]
make changes to the environment write

[01:12:15 - 01:12:19]
actions like sending emails placing

[01:12:17 - 01:12:21]
orders or initiating transfers

[01:12:19 - 01:12:22]
dramatically increase your system's

[01:12:21 - 01:12:24]
capabilities but also introduce

[01:12:22 - 01:12:25]
significant risks these should be

[01:12:24 - 01:12:27]
implemented with icient caution and

[01:12:25 - 01:12:29]
appropriate safeguards as your

[01:12:27 - 01:12:30]
architecture grows in complexity keeping

[01:12:29 - 01:12:32]
track of everything becomes increasingly

[01:12:30 - 01:12:34]
challenging this is where monitoring and

[01:12:32 - 01:12:36]
observability become critical while

[01:12:34 - 01:12:38]
related they serve slightly different

[01:12:36 - 01:12:39]
purposes monitoring tracks external

[01:12:38 - 01:12:41]
outputs to detect when something goes

[01:12:39 - 01:12:43]
wrong but doesn't necessarily help

[01:12:41 - 01:12:45]
identify the cause it's like knowing

[01:12:43 - 01:12:46]
your car broke down but not why

[01:12:45 - 01:12:48]
observability on the other hand ensures

[01:12:46 - 01:12:50]
that sufficient information about your

[01:12:48 - 01:12:51]
system's internal state is collected so

[01:12:50 - 01:12:53]
that when something goes wrong you can

[01:12:51 - 01:12:54]
diagnose the issue without deploying new

[01:12:53 - 01:12:56]
code it's like having sensors throughout

[01:12:54 - 01:12:58]
your car that can pinpoint exactly what

[01:12:56 - 01:13:00]
failed there are three key metrics that

[01:12:58 - 01:13:03]
can help you evaluate your observability

[01:13:00 - 01:13:06]
mttd or mean time to detection how long

[01:13:03 - 01:13:08]
it takes to detect an issue mttr

[01:13:06 - 01:13:10]
meantime to response and CFR change

[01:13:08 - 01:13:12]
failure rate which is the percentage of

[01:13:10 - 01:13:13]
deployments that result in failures each

[01:13:12 - 01:13:15]
component in your pipeline should have

[01:13:13 - 01:13:16]
its own metrics and you should

[01:13:15 - 01:13:18]
understand how these metrics correlate

[01:13:16 - 01:13:19]
to your business's Northstar metrics

[01:13:18 - 01:13:21]
remember the golden rule of

[01:13:19 - 01:13:23]
observability just log everything when

[01:13:21 - 01:13:25]
metrics indicate a problem detailed logs

[01:13:23 - 01:13:27]
help you identify exactly what went

[01:13:25 - 01:13:29]
wrong as your application evolves to

[01:13:27 - 01:13:31]
include multiple models data sources and

[01:13:29 - 01:13:32]
tools managing these interactions can

[01:13:31 - 01:13:34]
become increasingly complex this is

[01:13:32 - 01:13:36]
where an orchestrator becomes valuable

[01:13:34 - 01:13:38]
helping you specify how these components

[01:13:36 - 01:13:40]
work together AI orchestrator tools like

[01:13:38 - 01:13:42]
Lang chain llama index flow wise Lang

[01:13:40 - 01:13:45]
flow and hay stock help manage these

[01:13:42 - 01:13:46]
complex pipelines however it's often

[01:13:45 - 01:13:49]
wise to start building your application

[01:13:46 - 01:13:50]
without an orchestrator first to

[01:13:49 - 01:13:52]
understand the core mechanics before

[01:13:50 - 01:13:53]
adding another layer of abstraction now

[01:13:52 - 01:13:56]
let's talk about what might be the most

[01:13:53 - 01:13:57]
valuable asset in AI engineering user

[01:13:56 - 01:13:59]
feedback this feedback provides

[01:13:57 - 01:14:01]
proprietary data that can give you a

[01:13:59 - 01:14:02]
genuine competitive advantage while

[01:14:01 - 01:14:04]
everyone can access the same Foundation

[01:14:02 - 01:14:06]
models only you have access to how your

[01:14:04 - 01:14:09]
specific users interact with your system

[01:14:06 - 01:14:11]
user feedback comes in two main forms

[01:14:09 - 01:14:13]
explicit feedback is directly provided

[01:14:11 - 01:14:15]
by users this is things like Thumbs Up

[01:14:13 - 01:14:17]
and Down ratings star ratings or written

[01:14:15 - 01:14:18]
comments implicit feedback is inferred

[01:14:17 - 01:14:21]
from user Behavior this could be things

[01:14:18 - 01:14:23]
like early termination error Corrections

[01:14:21 - 01:14:25]
or question clarifications complaint

[01:14:23 - 01:14:27]
messages sentiment frequency of

[01:14:25 - 01:14:29]
regenerating responses and conversation

[01:14:27 - 01:14:31]
length when designing your feedback

[01:14:29 - 01:14:33]
systems consider carefully when to

[01:14:31 - 01:14:34]
request input you could ask for feedback

[01:14:33 - 01:14:35]
at the beginning of the experience like

[01:14:34 - 01:14:37]
like asking for skill level in a

[01:14:35 - 01:14:39]
language learning app or when something

[01:14:37 - 01:14:41]
unexpected happens like slow response

[01:14:39 - 01:14:42]
time or at natural decision points like

[01:14:41 - 01:14:45]
offering between two alternative

[01:14:42 - 01:14:46]
responses the goal is to gather valuable

[01:14:45 - 01:14:48]
insights without disrupting the user

[01:14:46 - 01:14:50]
experience remember that every request

[01:14:48 - 01:14:52]
for feedback creates friction so use

[01:14:50 - 01:14:53]
these opportunities wisely while we've

[01:14:52 - 01:14:56]
covered each component separately a

[01:14:53 - 01:14:58]
mature AI application integrates all

[01:14:56 - 01:15:00]
these elements into a cohesive system

[01:14:58 - 01:15:01]
the architecture you choose should align

[01:15:00 - 01:15:03]
with your specific use case technical

[01:15:01 - 01:15:04]
constraints and business objectives one

[01:15:03 - 01:15:06]
important thing to remember is that

[01:15:04 - 01:15:08]
complexity should serve a purpose only

[01:15:06 - 01:15:10]
add components that solve real problems

[01:15:08 - 01:15:12]
for your application sometimes a simpler

[01:15:10 - 01:15:14]
architecture with fewer moving Parts is

[01:15:12 - 01:15:15]
more reliable and easier to maintain

[01:15:14 - 01:15:17]
than a complex one with every Bell and

[01:15:15 - 01:15:19]
whistle the field of AI engineering is

[01:15:17 - 01:15:21]
still rapidly evolving with new

[01:15:19 - 01:15:23]
techniques and best practices emerging

[01:15:21 - 01:15:25]
daily the most successful AI Engineers

[01:15:23 - 01:15:26]
maintain flexibility in their

[01:15:25 - 01:15:28]
architecture allowing them to

[01:15:26 - 01:15:30]
incorporate new advances while providing

[01:15:28 - 01:15:31]
stable reliable experiences to their

[01:15:30 - 01:15:33]
users and that wraps up our journey

[01:15:31 - 01:15:35]
through AI engineering we've covered an

[01:15:33 - 01:15:36]
incredible amount of ground from
