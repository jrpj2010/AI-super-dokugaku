# A Guide to Novel Writing for Intuitive Plotters

## 概要
本動画は、一般的なプロット手法に馴染めない「直感型プロッター」に焦点を当て、自身の直感を最大限に活かしながら小説を執筆・構成するための具体的なガイドを提供します。キーワードや視覚化を用いたプロット、アイデアの自由な探索、直感の記録、問題の明確化、効果的な推敲プロセスなど、直感的なアプローチに沿ったヒントが多数紹介されており、多くの視聴者が自身の執筆スタイルを理解し、自信を持って創作に取り組むための助けとなっています。

## 主要なポイント
- 従来のプロット方法が合わないと感じる**直感型プロッター**に向けた実践的なアドバイス。

- 時系列での執筆と、必要に応じた**アウトライン**からの逸脱の許容。
- 効果的な**推敲**のための作品全体の読書と複数回のパス。

## 詳細内容

### はじめに：直感型プロッターとは [00:01:00]
本動画は、事前に詳細なプロットを立てる一般的な方法が自身には合わないと感じている「**直感型プロッター**」に向けて作られています。多くの視聴者が、従来のライティングアドバイスがプロッター向けに偏っていると感じていた中で、自身の執筆スタイルが「直感型」であると特定でき、安心感を得たとコメントしています。（@sandrecunha5297, @Jeymorley, @drexler4340, @mmrilley など多数）

### 直感を活かすプロット手法 [02:45:00]
**直感**を刺激し、アイデアを前に進めるような方法でプロットを行うことを推奨します。Ellen Brock [02:45:00]

#### 4つの具体的なプロット方法 [05:05:00]
1.  **要約**、個別の副プロット、感情の遷移などを要素としてプロットする方法。ストーリーの流れやキャラクターの感情的な変化を捉えやすくなります。（@rebeccadey はこの方法を既に実践し、効果を感じているとコメントしています。）Ellen Brock [05:05:00]
2.  **キーワード**を用いてプロットする方法。シーンの雰囲気を表す単語など、短い言葉でアイデアを掴むことが有効です。これは、シーンや章の「雰囲気」や「バイブス」を捉えるのに非常に役立ち、多くの視聴者にとって目から鱗の方法だったようです。（@AaronPlay, @cadencev5572 が**キーワード**の有効性をコメントしています。）Ellen Brock [05:05:00]
3.  ノートカードを用いる方法。プロットの最初の段階でアイデアを出し尽くすため、またはプロットの最後の段階で全体の整理に利用できます。Ellen Brock [05:05:00]
4.  視覚化を用いる方法。キャラクターについて空想したり、頭の中でストーリーを「見る」時間を大切にします。特に日常的な作業中など、意識を完全に集中させていない時に良いアイデアが浮かびやすいという意見もあります。（@rhetteverette2406 が日常作業中の空想の有効性をコメントしています。@marianaquirino9418 も、空想に費やす時間に対する罪悪感が払拭されたことに感謝しています。）音楽を聴きながらストーリーを「見る」ことも有効です。（@rubyrocks5 がBGMによるインスピレーションについてコメントしています。）Ellen Brock [05:05:00]

### アイデアの探索と適切な量のプロット [14:35:00]
アイデアを自由に探索する時間を十分に取ることの重要性を強調します。Ellen Brock [14:35:00]
自分自身にとって、ストーリーを実際に書き始めるのに十分な、かつ過剰ではない適切なプロット量を見つけることが大切です。Ellen Brock [15:50:00]

### 直感の記録と問題への対処 [16:40:00]
直感的にひらめいたこと、頭の中に浮かんだことを、たとえ断片的であったり不明瞭であったりしても、とにかく書き留めることを推奨します。これは、**直感**の爆発的な流れを捉え、後で整理するための重要なステップです。（@k3ys, @c.c.l.9139, @thethmooteresa が、この「**直感**を書き留める」という点が非常に響いたとコメントしています。）Ellen Brock [16:40:00]
執筆中に直面する曖昧な問題や疑問は、立ち止まって具体的に「何が問題なのか」を言葉にして定義することで解決の糸口が見つかりやすくなります。（@jaredmcdaris7370 が、問題の特定と明確化の重要性を強調しています。）Ellen Brock [18:40:00]

### 執筆と推敲の進め方 [20:35:00]
執筆は、原則として時系列に沿って進めることを推奨します。Ellen Brock [20:35:00]
作成した**アウトライン**はあくまで指針であり、執筆中に新たなアイデアが生まれたり、ストーリーが予期せぬ方向に進んだりした場合でも、そこから逸脱することを自分に許容します。Ellen Brock [22:10:00]
小説本体の編集に入る前に、**アウトライン**自体を見直し、必要に応じて修正・編集することを推奨します。Ellen Brock [23:30:00]
効果的な**推敲**のために、小説全体を一度に（またはできるだけ少ない回数で）通読し、全体像を把握しながらメモを取ります。その後、キャラクター、プロット、テーマなど、特定の問題に焦点を当てて複数回読み返します。Ellen Brock [24:35:00]
**推敲**は、小説の最初から順番に進めることを推奨します。Ellen Brock [29:15:00]
もし**直感**だけではどうしても解決策が見つからない問題に直面した場合は、既存の構造的なシステムや他のライティングアドバイスに助けを求めることも有効です。Ellen Brock [31:30:00]

## 結論
この動画は、「**直感型プロッター**」という独自の執筆スタイルを持つ人々に対し、その**直感**を否定するのではなく、効果的に活用するための実践的なツールと心構えを提供します。**キーワード**を使ったプロットやアイデアの視覚化、**直感**を捉える具体的な方法、そして**アウトライン**に縛られすぎない執筆・**推敲**プロセスは、多くの視聴者にとって自身の執筆における障害を取り除き、自信を持って創作を進めるための大きな助けとなっています。

### 1. @AaronPlay (👍 3)
Yeah, this me. I never imagined how helpful plotting using key words would be. When I did it I thought of them as chapter titles. After a day I had a title for every chapter in the outline. It felt like I had so much forward momentum as a result.

### 2. @jaredmcdaris7370 (👍 47)
Yup. I imagined myself telling you a problem with my novel, and as soon as I articulated the problem, there the solution was, staring me in the face. It’s remarkable how easy it is to forget: identify and articulate the problem.

> **@EllenBrock** (👍 2): That's awesome!

> **@Peachu_n_Goma_Home** (👍 2): The problem is the problem has no easy solution (not without drastically changing the story). XD

### 3. @SS-qp2ex (👍 4)
Ellen - Girl - You need to write a book with this info!! Amazing !!!

### 4. @rhetteverette2406 (👍 12)
Definitely agree with the daydreaming about your characters when you are not writing and imo the best day comes when doing mundane chores(ie the dishes, the lawn ect) something simple enough that you can autopilot and let your mind go

> **@rhetteverette2406** (👍 1): *the best daydreaming

### 5. @maryridgleycooney5221 (👍 2)
Just another helpful thing I learned from another author is carrying a voice recorder or get an app on your phone. I use this for when I get a spark of creativity or working out ideas to recording dialogue. The author I learned this from writers her books this way and I think a fantasy author does this too. Long drives and traveling, taking nature walks etc, this comes in handy.

### 6. @Jeymorley (👍 2)
Thank you so much! I was sure I was a methodological writer, but it wasn't like I needed "structure", ideas and whole scenes come to my mind at random moments and look so vivid - after this video I know for a fact I'm an intuitive plotter, and need to stop "boxingx myself in. I'm just "efficient" in my life in general and love classification and stuff, but my intuition has a life of its own

### 7. @sandrecunha5297 (👍 263)
It seems most writing advice is written by writers who are plotters. This video is so helpful for those of us who are not plotters. I also always appreciate your video’s being from an editorial point of view as you give more consideration to varying styles or ways of reaching one’s writing goals. You are GOLD!

> **@EllenBrock** (👍 23): Thank you so much! I'm really glad you like the videos.

> **@ThreadBomb** (👍 24): Funny, my experience is that most writing advice comes from pantsers. Certainly the best known writing guide at this point is by a complete pantser - Stephen King's 'On writing'.

> **@maryridgleycooney5221** (👍 6): @@ThreadBomb you're write, I could never write like that. Word counts send my anxiety thru the roof😄

> **@oracleofaltoona** (👍 6): I have to agree with this comment 100%. This is literally the first writing advice that speaks to me in terms of structuring ….not really structuring but instead of using an outline (i hate outlines) to somehow organize my work . I just wanted to leave this comment because I am completely bowled over by this . It is fantastic and just thank you so much.

> **@polymathematics_** (👍 9): Stephen King is great for advice from a discovery writer, Brandon Sanderson has A TON of content on plotting.

### 8. @drexler4340 (👍 2)
This has been so helpful in so many ways. It has called out my wish to be a discovery writer but truly I need more structure than that, and you were able to articulate why (e.g., can't sustain all the parts for longer prose; getting lost). I realized that what I'm actually "discovering" is my intuition about people and narratives. I also realized this is how I write for academic writing such as my dissertation or scholarly manuscripts. Thank you so much!

### 9. @Dominator046 (👍 73)
Ellen's videos are not a five minute, how-to-get-rich as an author style video.
Ellen's videos are gold-mines of information, experience, and assistance for writers or potential writers to cross the next goal.

Ellen's videos are an absolute delight, and super helpful.
I was happy to confirm that I fell into this type, which wasn't a certainty. But so much of what Ellen said spoke to me, my mannerisms, and my potential strategies for success.

Thank you for all that you do, Ellen!

> **@EllenBrock** (👍 1): Thank you so much! I'm so glad you liked the video.

### 10. @mmrilley (👍 17)
My biggest takeaway (other than your incredible insight and advice) is that there's nothing wrong with me! You revealing obstacles that I encounter gives me permission to go easier on myself. Thank you!

### 11. @kit888 (👍 208)
00:01 Intro
02:45 Plot in a way that sparks intuition
05:05 Four plotting methods
1. Plot using summaries, separate side plots and emotional transitions
2. Plot using keywords
3. Plot using note cards, either at the start or end of plotting process
4. Plot using visualization
14:35 Explore your idea freely
15:50 Find the amount of plotting that's right for you
16:40 Write down what you intuit
18:40 Turn vague issues into defined problems
20:35 Write in chronological order
22:10 Allow yourself to deviate from the outline
23:30 Edit the outline before editing the novel
24:35 Read the whole novel at once (or in as few sittings as possible), take notes, make multiple passes to concentrate on different issues
29:15 Polish front to back
31:30 Know when you can't intuit the answer, try a structure system

> **@liladiller** (👍 3): thank you for taking the time to do this!! I was trying to find the ideas in writing so I can save them

> **@ladyjiles** (👍 1): This is great, I was hoping the video description would include this so grateful for your comment. Thank you!

### 12. @cadencev5572 (👍 9)
Using keywords makes SO MUCH SENSE. I can't believe I never thought of it before. Scenes really do have vibes to them.

### 13. @rubyrocks5 (👍 4)
Instrumental music really helps me get inspired and gain clarity/creativity. Something about music (especially movie soundtracks) helps me “see” the emotions or plots or characters that I want to write. If you’re stuck or lacking inspiration, you might want to listen to inspiring music that has the same “vibe” as your novel

### 14. @WriteUnread (👍 2)
This is so validating. So many of these points are things I'd intuitively (ha!) been drawn to doing, like making playlists or scanning through my keyword-summaries of previous scenes before I jump into writing, but I always conceptualized it as just wasting time/spinning my wheels/procrastinating, habits I should be trying to grow out of, not as actual necessary parts of my writing process.

### 15. @EllenBrock (👍 65)
Happy 2022! I hope it's off to a great start! 

If you've watched the previous videos, new information starts at 02:47

I also forgot to mention in the video that intuitive plotters might find the technique described in my "How to Plot Your Novel Fast" video useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-I9N5LsvPM

Thanks for watching! I'm excited for all the new videos I have planned this year!

> **@LeafarMind** (👍 2): Yes, "how to plot faster" helped me

> **@EllenBrock** (👍 1): @I z Thanks! You too!

### 16. @marianaquirino9418 (👍 3)
I'm fascinated. I always daydreamed a lot about my stories. I can do this for hours, I always felt guilty for spending so much time in my head and not on paper. You saying this can be positive changes everything for me. thanks

### 17. @vitotamito (👍 3)
9:30 I just recently started putting in a single quote from a character into every aspect of what I outline, from comments about set pieces to a specific bit of dialogue I want to get to in a scene, and the section right before this time code just explained why I started doing that! Neat!

### 18. @rebeccadey (👍 63)
I had a feeling I was this type, and I turned out to be right. This video was so validating; sometimes I feel too disorganized as a plotter, or even bogged down by it (someone else wrote that writing ideas down can make them feel like law, and that is so true for me as well) but I can't just jump into a story like a pantser; I need some direction. Hearing the first tip be "plot with summaries" made me smile, because I am doing that right now. It helps me get into the story until it's almost a zero draft, where the characters give me dialogue and the whole thing starts to flow. Its like freewriting, almost, but with purpose. That said, I'll be adding your suggestion of creating a plot summary as well, with story structure beats, to know I'm hitting those points and have them where they need to go. I never thought about doing both. You are a gem, Ellen!

> **@EllenBrock** (👍 2): I'm glad you have a system that works for you and that the video was helpful!

> **@desireen.7475** (👍 0): So related!

### 19. @k3ys (👍 73)
“Write down what you intuit” really hit hard, personally.  Thanks so much for bringing it to light.

> **@c.c.l.9139** (👍 8): This works so well for me. I just freeflow a summary of what I want to write. It looks like psychotic ramblings and includes a bunch of shorthand no one else would be able to decipher, but once I rewrite the outline from that, it works out wonderfully. It helps me capture that burst of intuition and get it down on the page.

> **@thethmooteresa** (👍 1): Absolutely the best line ever ♡♡♡ fellow intuitive writer

### 20. @veronikachristen2373 (👍 65)
Funny enough "Metholodical Pantser" and "Intuitive Plotter" where the two types I related to the most. ;) So as expected I found this almost as helpful as the last one. Great work! And thanks for sharing these types with us, I find it incredibly helpful to realize not all writing advice MUST work for me.

> **@db-jugg3r** (👍 6): I totally agree here. Both videos have been very helpful and added up to the things i know about storytelling and worldbuilding from roleplaying-sessions as the game master.

> **@artsymoonsylav5971** (👍 7): I was worried because I felt like I have to pick only one,  when I relate greatly with both of the categories you mentioned. So it’s comforting and reassuring for me to know that I can have both tips 😅 (makes me wonder why I was so afraid)
