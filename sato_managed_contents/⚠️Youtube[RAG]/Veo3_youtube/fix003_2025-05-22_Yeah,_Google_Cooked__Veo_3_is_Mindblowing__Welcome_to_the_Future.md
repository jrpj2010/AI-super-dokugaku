## 説明

In this episode, I dive deep into the latest advancements from Google's IO keynote, focusing on the groundbreaking new AI video generator, VEO 3. Instead of just talking about it, I demonstrate its capabilities by generating videos with consistent characters and native audio using Google Flow. From creating cinematic scenes featuring unique prompts to comparing VEO 2 and VEO 3, I explore the incredible potential and current limitations of these tools. Despite some bugs and a steep price, the native audio generation in VEO 3 stands out as a huge leap forward. Join me as I experiment, critique, and imagine the future of AI video generation.

I won't stop coding my open source python 3d engine.
Nor I will stop making games with it, based on my stories.
They might have some AI in there, but why would I stop doing what I like, If I find the time?

> **@BracerJack** (👍 0): ​@@rogue_minima_roni_lI am also working on a game myself, I scrapped the first game that I have been working in for six months because there are A.I. art in it and I grew increasing disgusted by myself as I continue working on it.
Focusing on my second game now, I will focus on doing it all Human, all me, just me.

> **@2kool4u_mac67** (👍 1): 1 year away from total despair believe me

> **@onidaaitsubasa4177** (👍 4): Just incorporate your 3D with the AI usage, AI is almost impossible to get the exact 3D effects you want especially if your 3D is very unique, Due to the way AI prompts work you could retry variations of prompts 100 times or so and it still won't have the desired effect or style you want, It would be like you're the director trying to tell the special effects person what you want without knowing the exact way to describe anything, 3D CGI guided AI, meaning you use your 3D work as a guide for what the AI makes would actually be better than regular prompt AI, So there is very valid need for 3D artists and effects creators, especially with Unreal 5 and it's lifelike rendering ability.

> **@onidaaitsubasa4177** (👍 0): ​@@rogue_minima_roni_l Exactly, AI is very difficult to use to get all those unique things or 3D creative games and works, truly unique works are going to be very valuable, especially if they incorporate some mechanic that hasn't been done before, AI is only good for popular things or pre existing things, it can't do extremely unique creations at least not without making 400 prompts and using over 1000 dollars in Tokens, and who's gonna do that when it's just easier to do your own 3D creation, AI might be a good post stage rendering assist tool to real 3D artists and effects people, but it's a poor replacement for original ingenuity.

### 7. @martinpercy5908 (👍 4)
Thanks Matt! Great video. one request: for next time please could we also see some "boring" prompts"? ; We all know AI is great at doing crazy stuff, but for reference it would be really useful to see just a simple dramatic conversation in a room, because that's often where AI video struggles. Thanks again, great work!

AI is developing faster than people realize

> **@teelo523** (👍 14): It doubles in ability every 7 months. This will shrink as it gets smarter

> **@ldevs430** (👍 25): At this point, I believe they're just drip-feeding us. They probably have stuff we couldn't even begin to imagine.

> **@themasterofanalyticsandwie1342** (👍 5): Its price and accessibility that's holds poeple back in realizing curring edge tools, especially since some AI models can become outdated in little as 4 months

With Veo 3 and Kling 2.0 being insanely expensive, I'm a bit concerned how pricey this stuff will be in a few years with inflation. It's already out of my budget range.

> **@ldevs430** (👍 12): I think that was always the plan. We help make it great, then up go the gates

> **@angryox3102** (👍 2): Hopefully the models become more efficient and the price comes down and/or open source improves.

> **@thebra** (👍 1): Generally this stuff gets cheaper over time. But if there isn't great competition it might not be the case.

> **@CamAlert2** (👍 2): That just means you're not the target market.

> **@vainezaiven6677** (👍 0): @@ldevs430 Yeah, there's no way these big companies (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.) are doing this so that We the People can benefit. 

Good news is, there's still open-source.

> **@onidaaitsubasa4177** (👍 0): If it can do blue sludge, I wonder if it could do changeling transformation effects like on the Star Trek Deep Space 9 TV show, and if those companies used AI tech to make a new series, imagine the time saving special effects work they could do.

Too censored for real creativity, unfortunately. Also, image to video is not available yet.

> **@zlkanglwrth2776** (👍 25): It's dumb that they over censor. Really? No conflict? No battles? Nothing

> **@thecontentproducer** (👍 14): It’s just a taste of what’s to come. By the time the 50% off deal runs out, Kling or Runway would have caught up with Veo3. Less censorship with Kling though

> **@DreamScapesAxisEntrainmentllc** (👍 3): Exactly, VEO 3 still over-rated and there's much better options.
