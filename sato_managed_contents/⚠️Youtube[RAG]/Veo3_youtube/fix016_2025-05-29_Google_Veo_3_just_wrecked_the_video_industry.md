running video game graphics without actually running video game graphics is an interesting one tho as both are done on the GPU

Veo 3 is the most impressive video generator by far at this point. But it's still less than a tenth as good as what I imagine a _perfect_ video generator would look like. Maybe we'll have fully AI generated films with theatrical releases in a couple years.

> **@theAIsearch** (👍 5): thanks for sharing!

> **@austrich0** (👍 15): i expect a couple decades. uncanny valley (the area so close to reality but not quite) is an extreme hurdle.

also pareto principal (20% effort for 80% of the progress), i believe we are nearing the end of the "easy" part.

> **@nottyseel949** (👍 11): @@austrich0 Yeah, I'm pretty sensitive to the uncanny valley.  It actually feels like watching a horror film where you tense up expecting something.  Like the gymnast stuff is hard for me to watch.

My concern is that sometimes to fix a problem you have to go entirely in a different direction.  Especially with things like generating a game as compared to generating a scene that LOOKS like a game.  All the scenes nail the look, but that part is so easy to fool.  It might be a completely different approach that's required to actually capture precision.

> **@nottyseel949** (👍 3): @@austrich0 I think the best example is tracing a drawing as compared to actually learning to draw.  Or copying someone's homework as compared to actually learning how to do the work.  The results look similar, but the methods aren't at all the same.

> **@nemonomen3340** (👍 2): @@austrich0  Familiar with the concept but not the phrase. Might try adopting it. I'm not sure if it applies that well to the near future, though. On one hand, you're probably right that it gets increasingly difficult to produce better results in an exponential curve.
On the other hand, advancements in AI are helping to produce breakthroughs in basically every field of study including its own at this point. "The singularity" is a bit of a clique sci-fi trope, but it isn't based in _total_ nonsense.
But after thinking more about it, I am imagining it'll be _at least_ 5 years before these tools are good enough to make consistently decent films.

### 17. @RaydeusMX (👍 38)
One of the main uses I hope to see is completely replacing all low quality in between animation with AI. That way studios can focus entirely on key frames, which would increase animation quality while reducing costs and specially production times. 

(PS > Also things like misc background animation that is usually left static to save money. If you can just provide the key frames/background and let the AI add all the movement for people, traffic etc it would look so much better.)

> **@fluffsquirrel** (👍 10): Now that's a compromise I think everyone can agree with! Hopefully it takes this route rather than either complete AI hate or all artists lose their jobs!

> **@Ancient1341** (👍 7): Or use it as a base and touch it up

> **@L3-dm7fz4ix5uA** (👍 3): People will soon create uncensored footage locally. ❤️

> **@Cross-CutFilms** (👍 4): I have some questions.  Well quite a few actually...  What do you mean by "low quality in-between frames"? (Interpolation?)
What do you mean by "the key frames"?  Could you more specific?  Are you talking about specific position points of an item, object, character or effects in a single frame and the movement of such points across frames (creating motion and movement)?  Or lastly... What specific field of animation? Cell drawn, stop motion, flash equivalent, 3D?
