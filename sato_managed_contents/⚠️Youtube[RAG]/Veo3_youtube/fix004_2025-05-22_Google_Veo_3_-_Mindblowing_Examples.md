## 詳細内容
### Google Veo 3の発表とその能力 [00:00:00]
Googleが新しいフロー（**Veo 3**）AI動画モデルをリリースした。これはプロンプトから映像だけでなく、対話、効果音、音楽を含むマルチモーダルなコンテンツを生成できる、驚異的な能力を持つ。公開から24時間以内に生成されたデモ例がその実力を示している。
Mik [00:00:00]

### 初期デモ例への反応と評価 [00:00:00]
**Veo 3**のデモ映像は、多くのユーザーから「次世代を超えている」「スピルバーグが夢を学習させたようだ」と絶賛されている。特に、玉ねぎがスキレットで跳ねる際の正確な物理表現や、紙飛行機が空中でバランスを取る様子は驚くべき点として指摘されている。トラックのシーンには「浮いているようだ」という改善点も示唆されたが、全体としては「並外れている」との評価が多い。

#### オーディオ生成への期待 [00:00:00]
**Veo 3**がオーディオも同時に生成できることから、オーディオドラマなどの音声コンテンツ制作における応用への期待も大きい。これまでは音声の感情表現が難しかったが、AIによって可能になる点が注目されている。AIがまず音声を生成し、それに合わせて映像を生成しているのではないか、という技術的な推測もされている。
@TrentonMatthews, @thevideoproductionguy, @MulleDK19 [00:00:00]

### 映像業界への影響と課題 [00:00:00]
AIによる動画生成の進化は、映像制作業界に深い懸念をもたらしている。CGアーティストや照明技師といった専門家は、自身の職業が失われる可能性を危惧している。しかし、歴史的に見ても新しいツールが登場するたびに一部の職業は消滅してきたという見方もある。
@havanother1, @TheParot161, @thevideoproductionguy [00:00:00]

#### ワークフローと編集の課題 [00:00:00]
広告業界などのプロの現場では、クライアントからの細かい修正要求が多く、AIで生成した動画の特定の部分だけをピンポイントで制御・変更できるかが重要な課題となる。現状のAIでは全体の再生成になる可能性が高く、細かい調整が求められる現場では導入が難しいという意見がある。ただし、画像からの動画変換ワークフローを利用すれば、ショットごとに編集できる可能性や、将来的に技術がこの課題を解決するという楽観的な見方もある。
@nimaj-k3r, @thelogline, @thevideoproductionguy [00:00:00]

### AIコンテンツの未来像 [00:00:00]
AIによるコンテンツ生成速度の加速は、「創造性のルネサンス」をもたらすか、「大量の陳腐なスロップ」を生み出すかという議論を呼んでいる。AIツールは他の技術と同様に、創造的な心を持つ人々は独創的なアートを生み出すために利用し、大半の人々は陳腐なものを作るだろうという意見がある。数ヶ月以内には高品質なAI動画がSNSに溢れ、「Ready-to-go」コンテンツが増加し、アートや人間性にとって癌となりうるという懸念も表明されている。
@janseb.steffen2554, @matthall8902, @LpkLpk-qz6ji [00:00:00]

#### 参入障壁の低下と新たな市場 [00:00:00]
AI技術によって映像制作の参入障壁が低下し、伝統的な手段を持たない人々でも素晴らしいアイデアを実現できるようになるという肯定的な見方がある。YouTubeのようなプラットフォームがそうしたコンテンツの市場となる可能性も指摘されている。一方で、企業が内製化を進めることで、フリーランスなどの専門家の市場がなくなるという懸念もある。技術が「テック界のオリガルヒ」に富を集中させるだけだという批判的な意見も存在する。
@this_epic_name, @TheStarBlack, @havanother1 [00:00:00]

## 結論
Google **Veo 3** は、映像と音声を統合して生成するAI技術の現状を示す驚異的な進歩である。その高品質なデモは、多くの人を魅了し、映像制作業界の未来に対する大きな期待と同時に、雇用の喪失やコンテンツの質の変化といった深刻な懸念も引き起こしている。技術は急速に進化しており、数ヶ月後にはさらに高度な能力を持つモデルが登場し、社会や文化に大きな影響を与えるだろう。今後の焦点は、技術の制御性、編集の粒度、そしてAIが生み出すコンテンツが芸術として成立しうるのか、あるいは単なる大量消費される「スロップ」になるのか、という点に移っていくと考えられる。

Google Veo 3 isn’t just next-gen — it’s next universe. These examples feel like Spielberg trained an AI on dreams. Can’t wait to see what creators do with this magic!

Your industrial insight makes this by far the premier review of this new tech that I have seen.  Really valuable commentary that makes me appreciate this marvel of engineering all the more 💙
We live in the most exciting times and I'm so grateful to be here!

> **@havanother1** (👍 0): Yep, me too. So grateful and excited this will take my job. My friend's jobs. And pretty much negate a hundred years or so of film-making, acting, camerawork, animation, SFX, CG, writing, creativity... because now any monkey can make stuff, all the wonderful things people have made before, are just as worthless as the rubbish everyone's going to crank out now. But hey, don't worry about the industry, I'm sure they'll "incorporate it into their workflow" - translation: scrabble to squeeze a few last bucks out of their careers before all the money is transferred from yet another industry to Google and the other tech oligarchs.

### 3. @TrentonMatthews (👍 11)
I don't know if Veo 3 has an audio competitor, but this would make audio production for audio dramas, like... wow!

You've got a new subscriber!

A blind/visually impaired subscriber, at that!

The paperboat is far more impressive than initially apparent. The fact that the front of the board suspends in the air so that the center of gravity is in front before it falls???? THAT IS INSANE!!

> **@thevideoproductionguy** (👍 4): Right?! I initially thought to cut it from the video, because people might not be impressed, but it’s astonishing when you really think about it

> **@catbert7** (👍 0): Agreed!  There's just so much to be impressed about it that I can't properly appreciate any of it! 😅

### 7. @TheParot161 (👍 6)
Great video!  By FAR the best I have watched on the subject.  Your background in the industry adds so much. I have a good friend who does lighting for films, live sports broadcast, commercials and television shows. This technology makes me deeply concerned for the future of his profession. As for me personally, I’m not sure how I’m going to feel about watching a movie that I know doesn’t have any real human beings in it.  I mean I guess I’ll roll with it and enjoy it. But this whole thing just kind of blows my mind.  The idea that we won’t know whether we are watching a real person or not. I guess for a film or a commercial it doesn’t really matter. But it still gives me the heebie-jeebies

> **@thevideoproductionguy** (👍 2): Thanks! It feels uncanny, but We already have tons of movies with fully animated characters - from Pixar to Avatar - as long as the story is good, the techniques with disappear from our minds. Unfortunately, a lot of people will lose their jobs because of this, but every new tool in this industry eliminated some professions - from the physical film negative cutters to animators.

> **@catbert7** (👍 0): You've never watched an animated video? 🤨

### 8. @skynetsworld (👍 2)
If this is already almost perfect, imagine what Veo4 or Veo5 will be able to do. 😱

### 9. @QuietVoltage (👍 4)
We'll have nice little movies with no clean water to drink but plenty of energy blackouts and polluted air, but oh man the vids are gorgeous!

i work as a CG artist in the ad industry. this is amazing dont get me wrong. but until you can pin point a single thing and change it controlable  without changing anything else i dont think this is going to be used.
music video production is going to blow up first i guess. but ad clients are soooooooooo fucking picky. sometimes i work for a week just to tweak one single highlight. and then you cant forget that the expensive part is placing the ads. when you have to pay a million to see your ad in tv for a month clients are happy to pay me a few thousand bucks to make it exactly like they want.

> **@thelogline** (👍 2): These are great points. I work in ads as well as a motion designer. I think some sort of in painting with either this tool or another can solve those edits clients ask for

> **@thevideoproductionguy** (👍 8): That’s so true! However, if your workflow is based on image to video conversions, you can be very granular with edits for every shot. We are getting there. Remember, none of this existed even a year ago!

> **@LpkLpk-qz6ji** (👍 2): It is only a matter of time, and systems will be created to better index the consistency between images, and it will soon be possible to develop whole minutes of scripts while keeping the same protagonists.  Probably with this Veo 3 in less than 4 months we will see social media filled with such videos, whole pages with new forms of comedy and new “ready-to-go” content. To me all this is the cancer of art and humanity but that's okay.

> **@borzydar1196** (👍 0): On one hand yes, but on the other any change you ask of an artist is expensive that's why the changes are limited. If you can generate whole new clip at virtually no cost, noone would try to change a single thing. They would instead try to generate the best possible video they want anew.

> **@naiskal581** (👍 0): @@LpkLpk-qz6jiit looks pretty but the writing is still obviously ai slop

### 12. @MulleDK19 (👍 4)
I have seen a lot of these generated videos now, and I'm now pretty confident that they generate audio first, and then the video AI generates a matching video, and not the other way around.

> **@thevideoproductionguy** (👍 0): I think that’s a solid guess. They probably generate audio, then starting frame and then combine using various methods

> **@MulleDK19** (👍 0): ​@@thevideoproductionguyIf they generate audio first, it should be trivial to make an audio to video mode, which would be a very powerful way to direct videos.

### 13. @viceroy7792 (👍 4)
The physics on that clip of the onions in the skillet...that was brilliant. That truck in the mud was alright, but the truck seemed a bit "floaty".  It's all pretty extraordinary though. Just imagine how tight these images will be in September....

### 14. @janseb.steffen2554 (👍 20)
These Videos are absolutely wild. I don't think the current newscycle and humanity will be able to keep up at all with the content generation speed. Sometimes I ask myself whether the massive abundance of creativity will create a new art renaissance since its so easy to access? Or will it result in the massive creation of slob.

> **@FF420Raw** (👍 0): Last year I asked chatgpt for examples of vegan fertilizer options (as a test, I am WELL aware of the available options) to see how well it would do. 

That version of chatgpt recommended blood meal as one of the vegan options (I do use it, but vegan?!🤣🤣🤣). 

This year, I asked it and said previously it was recommended to use blood meal, would you still recommend as a vegan option? 

Well, the newer chatgpt basically laughed and said absolutely not, and correctly listed why it was beyond absurd to have originally been suggested.

> **@matthall8902** (👍 6): it's like all the other AI tools, the people with creative minds will figure out a way to use it to create original, compelling art, while most people will just use it to create hacky, derivative slop.

> **@hombacom** (👍 0): It’s like trying to find every website on internet. Sure you can miss out something but question is if it matter. What skills do you need. If something change all the time it’s no rush to learn it. We need better tools, prompting everything adds a lot of guessing and randomness.

### 15. @williamcousert (👍 2)
I think movie and TV trailers are going to be one of the first uses for this. Fan groups can make concept trailers for YouTube, and nobody will be able to tell the difference.

It's not 100% perfect, but it is darn good enough for UNLIMITED fun.

### 18. @TruckerSteve (👍 1)
Is it possible to sync to pre-recorded dialog say a previously recorded audio book or what have you

> **@thevideoproductionguy** (👍 2): Yes! It’s not as perfect as Veo 3, but there are multiple solutions that enable you to do that! There is Character 3 from Hedra and Sync models that are state of the art. In a few weeks we will get more control over the best quality models

### 19. @this_epic_name (👍 1)
What I think I love about this is that the barriers to entry are breaking down. The coolest, funniest, most brilliant ideas for media will be achievable by those without traditional means to bring those ideas to life.

> **@TheStarBlack** (👍 0): And what would a beginner in the industry do with the footage? There will be no market for it, since every company will just make their own.

> **@this_epic_name** (👍 0): @@TheStarBlack YouTube is already filling up with short "films" a few minutes long, stitched together from a slew of 8-second clips. This is less than a week after Veo3 was released. They're largely crap, no doubt, but so many people have stories to tell. The folks who can will be less limited, and places like YouTube form a market for that sort of content. The slop will sink. The good stuff -- potentially made by some 17 year old in a basement -- will rise.

> **@havanother1** (👍 0): That's what the tech bros always say. But all technology does is put less in the hands of regular folk, and more in the hands of tech bros. Look at where we are. Mr Musk, richest guy in the world, buys a social media channel so he can convince everyone to vote a certain way. So much for the internet being the great leveler with everyone getting a say.
