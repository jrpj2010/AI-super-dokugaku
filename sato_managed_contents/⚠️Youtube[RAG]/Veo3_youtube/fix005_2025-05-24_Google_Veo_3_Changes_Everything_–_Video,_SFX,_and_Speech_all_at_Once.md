# Google Veo 3 が全てを変える – 動画、効果音、音声全てを一度に

## 概要
本動画は、Googleの新しいAI動画モデル**Veo 3**について詳細に掘り下げています。**Veo 3**は単一のプロンプトから動画、効果音、リップシンクされた音声を同時に生成する能力を持ちます。動画制作者は様々な実例（対話シーン、音楽、複雑な動きなど）を用いてその能力を検証し、RunwayやKling、**Sora**といった他のモデルと比較しています。Veo 3が利用できるFlowプラットフォームの機能（画像から動画、シーン拡張など）や価格設定についても触れ、AI動画の現状と将来について考察しています。

## 主要なポイント
- Google **Veo 3**は、動画、効果音、リップシンク音声を単一プロンプトで同時生成可能。
- Flowプラットフォーム上で様々なテストを実施（対話、音楽、複雑な動きなど）。
- 他のAI動画モデル（Runway, Kling, **Sora**）との比較も行われた。
- 生成された動画には優れた点と課題（不自然な一時停止、奇妙な動きなど）が見られた。
- AI動画の進化は目覚ましく、その潜在能力と同時に、現実との区別、雇用への影響、倫理的な懸念といった広範な議論を巻き起こしている。

Summary
I dive deep into Google’s new AI video model, Veo 3, which can generate video, sound effects, and fully lip-synced dialogue—all from a single prompt. This was announced at Google i/o 2025. I put it to the test with dozens of real-world examples, from dialogue scenes and music to complex motion prompts like breakdancing, MMA, and interpretive dance. I also explore how it stacks up against other models like Runway, Kling, and Sora, break down its strengths and quirks, and give a full walkthrough of the Flow platform, including image-to-video, scene extensions, and pricing. It’s one of the most fun and chaotic tests I’ve done—and a look at where AI video is headed next.

I'm a 3D generalist - modelling, texturing, lighting, animation etc. I've been working in this field for around 30 years. Around 2 months ago I switched my machine off and that was that. There's still work out there but it's drying up fast especially in the advertising sector - my job is toast.  I imagine hundreds of thousands of those involved in the creative industries are counting the days - writers, photographers, animators, illustrators etc. What a tragedy - especially knowing that our legacy work has been harvested and scalped to generate this stuff by tech bro billionaires who couldn't give a shit about us and what makes life worth living.

We are doomed. Not hyperbole.  The moment you have no idea what is real and what is not, you loose your footing in reality.  You have no trust or confidence in anything unless it right in front of your eyes.  On the up side, live theatre is about to get very, very popular as people crave real-life talent & entertainment.

> **@2157AF** (👍 2): There maybe a limit to how much AI smart slop can invade the visual sphere. How much energy and how much physical graphics cards and cpus can be waisted on this. The better and more realistic visuals, the more tech and energy has to be burnt and computed. Eventually these data centres will be targets for reactionaries and green zealots.

If it's on a screen, a page, or in your memory, it's not.  What I find more interesting than 'what is real' is 'what matters.'  Figuring that out is intensely personal, and can take a lifetime, but (for me) it's the only thing that's remotely worthwhile.
