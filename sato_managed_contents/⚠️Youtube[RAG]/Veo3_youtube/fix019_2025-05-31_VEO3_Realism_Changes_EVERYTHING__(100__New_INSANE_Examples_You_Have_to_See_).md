Google just dropped VEO3, and it might be the most insane AI video model we’ve seen yet. I break down the wildest examples and what this means for the future of content, film, and reality itself.

> **@barryallen1035** (👍 1): It's over, Bro. Hollywood doesn't need stellar human talent anymore. Tom Cruise was already officially the last movie star and I'd say Jackie Chan, and Denzel Washington. You can throw Brad Pitt in there I suppose. Do you think Brad is as relevant today as these other guys? Brad still gets work, but IDK. Tom Cruise is still as huge now as he was in the 1980s and 1990s, it's insane.

I'm 56. For now, we laugh at elderly people who might not be able to discern AI content from real videos. But in the future it may be the other way around, in particular with respect to supposedly historical content: with the advent of hyper-realistic tech like VEO 3, older people might be the only ones able to recognize anachronisms and therefore conclude, a video is fake. I'm thinking of tech or cloths too new to appear in a certain context, stuff like that.

Hey my friend, I appreciate the content you’re sharing and the effort you put into your videos. I just wanted to give you some honest feedback sometimes the videos feel a bit long, and they tend to cover things many of us already know. What would really add value is seeing the actual process: how the videos are made, step by step. A tutorial prompts or behind the scenes breakdown would be super helpful. Thanks again for your work  just thought I’d share that in case it helps you connect more with your audience!

> **@qahnaarin6532** (👍 20): If you have to pay a sub AND buy credits, it isn't worth it. That's called price gouging. AI is developing so fast, by the end of next month this will be obsolete and the new one will be cheaper (possibly even free) on a better platform that doesn't require a sub and credit purchases.

In the meantime, practice your prompts on something else that's cheaper or free before dumping money into one that isn't fleshed out. There are plenty of others available.

Besides, the quality of his own AI videos made with this platform weren't all that great. First interview with the lady in the blue top, pronunciation of sooooo was grating. Sounded like she got stuck in the middle of saying soup. The next interview with the woman in the purple bikini, the audio was garbage. Anything they tried to say that had a short response never fully came out. Just sounded like blrble. In the 3rd interview, the scripting was backwards. The woman with the mic was answering questions, not answering them. By the 4th interview, this whole thing revealed itself as garbage marketing. 

Don't waste your time or money on this. After seeing only 2.5 mins of this video and seeing your reply, it's just obvious you couldn't get it to work while the prefabs he received for this video displayed failure from the source. Not wasting my time on the next 19 mins. It's guaranteed to be full of more errors shown at the start. Most of his other videos had better quality. This was disappointing in comparison to those that weren't 😔

### 10. @user-c3jdf9lylzse (👍 28)
cant wait for AI to make NPC's more dynamic they can mimic natural movement and respond to what im doing or saying without scripted dialogues now imagine that in an openworld game like cyberpunk

> **@lllllRoguelllllX** (👍 3): Yes but even better in a game like GTA 6 it would feel like a simulation instead of a game

> **@tonnentonie2767** (👍 0): For natural movement they would first need to have spatial awareness. And for the writing, this will also need to cook a little longer. I can see Todd right now prompting: " give me 1million medieval peasant dialogue lines".And so they go mostly unchecked into the games and it will be a quality loss right now.

You will not be able to trust anything. You will need AI to tell you what AI is…..

> **@LexingtonAvExpress** (👍 0): There will not be a concern of trust. Majority if not all content will be AI generated. The next generation will not know a world of actual human content

I think when people can no longer distinguish whether what they see is real or unreal, they'll stop watching. That goes against human nature. Perhaps AI is the greatest blessing humanity can receive.

I haven't seen a lot of A.I. stuff that anyone would find remotely interesting outside of being impressed that a computer can do it. If you can keep a character's look and behavior consisent across shots, and you can choose those shots and get very specific about how the A.I. character acts, A.I. movies could be a genre of movies. But all the hype now reminds me of the people saying the roads would be filled with driverless cars within a couple of years, ten years ago. We always expect moe than we end up getting

> **@keestel6975** (👍 0): This kind of "innovation" will make people realize that LIFE is lived by REAL PEOPLE in the REAL WORLD.  This kind of innovation will destroy the FAKE televised reality in which we have been living voor WAY TOO LONG.

> **@flickwtchr** (👍 5): That's like saying, leave your doors open to your business at closing time, that way, the thieves will become more noticeable, therefore we can be more aware of them so thievery goes down over time. 

Have you considered taking a basic logic class?

> **@flickwtchr** (👍 0): @@sammy-ix3eh You can't see that this is going to be every problem already experienced in social media, but much much worse?  We have no regulation in place, so how do you think scammers, unethical and ruthless politicians, criminals, blackmailers, etc are going to use this?

It doesn't take much imagination to see how bad this will go.  I don't suppose a fascist Administration would stoop to creating "evidence" against political enemies, right?  Remember, there is already AI tech that can take a likeness of someone and supplant another person in an existing video, like ones that could be made with this tech.

Sorry, I honestly don't mean to be personally insulting you with my logic comment, but I just don't see any logic saying this could possibly make the already disturbing deep fake situation better.  How could it?????????

FIrst thing I would ask VEO3 is:  Remake Star Wars VII, VIII and IX as if they were written and directed by George Lucas  and not Disney....

The moment you use intellectual property from Disney, they will start to hunt you down. Will be interesting, if they will legislate so that you can't even prompt something like this, or if it will be just illegal to have on your devices.
