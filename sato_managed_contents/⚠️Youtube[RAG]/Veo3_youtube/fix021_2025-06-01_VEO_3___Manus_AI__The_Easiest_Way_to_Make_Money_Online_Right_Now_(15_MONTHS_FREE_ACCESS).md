I’ve done everything to try to get access to the student email address so I can verify it and get the code for Gemini, but nothing has worked.

### 8. @briket-si2hr (👍 4)
Hey Nick, could you please clarify how one can earn, considering that in your video you mention that it's possible to create videos, and I assume in large quantities, for different businesses? But for that, you need the $249 plan, which provides unlimited use of VEO 3, while we only have free access for 15 months, and with that plan we can create 10 high-quality videos. Shouldn't we be creating videos of a lower quality instead? They are less effective, right? I'm not quite sure I understand. Could you please explain?

> **@NickPonte808** (👍 0): use the free plan to make content until you get your first paying client. use part of your intiial collected income to pay for the tools you need. Just like any other entrepreneurial endeavor.

### 9. @ApexIntegrations (👍 2)
Great video! I wanted to mention that I call my package a "Content Managment" package. We handle your content through socials, but we don't have to worry about conversions, CPM, CTR, or any SMM statistics. It eliminates the confusion of proformance, we charge a flat rate (not paid on CPM or CPC), and it seems to let the guard down of the client making it an easier close.  Way to bring light to this. Thanks Nick!

> **@SiennaElledge** (👍 0): Hey, totally feel you on keeping things simple for clients. I run a digital agency too and started using this new tool called Mydrop AI lately—honestly, being able to schedule months of content across all the social platforms with just a few clicks is what actually made my “content management” package run way smoother rn. Like, we literally planned a month’s content calendar for 5 brands in an afternoon and my team’s stress just dropped. Could see this making your flat-rate package even more hands-off. How do you guys handle batching content for clients?

> **@NickPonte808** (👍 0): Love that approach, super smart to keep it simple for clients and take the pressure off performance metrics. Flat rate offers definitely lower resistance. Appreciate you sharing that!
