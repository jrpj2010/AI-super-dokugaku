## 詳細内容
### 導入とAIデザインの可能性 [00:00:00]
DesignjoyのBrett氏は、AIを活用して美しいデザインを生成し、大きな収益を上げています。彼は、誰でもシンプルなステップで高品質なグラフィックを生成できることを示し、そこに魔法のような複雑さはないと述べます。AIツールは非常に強力で、その使い方は驚くほど簡単です。
[Greg & Brett] [00:00:00]

#### AIデザインは誰でもできる [02:47:00]
Brett氏は自身がデザイナーとしての経験があるものの、AIデザインのコンテンツはデザイナー以外の人々に向けて発信しています。**Midjourney**や**ChatGPT**のサブスクリプションがあれば、事前のデザイン知識は全く必要ありません。良いセンスがあれば役立ちますが、スキルの問題ではなく、非クリエイターでも美しいものを生成できます。
[Brett] [02:47:00]

#### AI生成ツールの階層 [03:33:00]
AI生成の世界には様々な領域（画像、動画など）があり、ツールの使いやすさにもレベルがあります。最も簡単なものから始め、徐々に応用に進むことができます。紹介するツールは特定の企業によるスポンサーではありません。
[Brett] [03:33:00]

### エントリーレベル: **Higgs Field** [04:04:00]
AI creationを試すための最も簡単なツールの一つが**Higgs Field**です。デザイン経験がない人でも始められます。

#### テンプレートと簡単な動画生成 [04:04:00]
**Higgs Field**は多数のテンプレートを提供しており、ユーザーはテンプレートを選択し、製品画像などをアップロードするだけで簡単に動画を作成できます。プロンプトの知識がなくても、プリセットのアクションやエフェクトを選べば、AIが理解し、動画を生成します。特に製品広告などに適しており、テキストも正確に維持されるようになりました。
[Brett] [04:04:00]

### 中間レベル: **ChatGPT**と**Midjourney**の組み合わせ [07:11:00]
Brett氏が最も頻繁に使うツールが**Midjourney**と**ChatGPT**で、これらを組み合わせて特別な方法で活用しています。

#### ツールの役割分担（**Midjourney**はスタイル、**ChatGPT**は具体的制御） [07:11:00]
**Midjourney**は画像生成に特化しており、特に芸術的なスタイリングに優れています。一方、**ChatGPT**はより具体的な要素の挿入や、写真の修正など写実的な調整に適しています。多数の画像生成ツールがありますが、この2つを使い分けることが重要です。
[Brett] [07:11:00]

#### プロンプト、画像参照、スタイル参照 [09:35:00]
**Midjourney**では、生成したい内容を指示するプロンプト、参照したい画像のURL（画像プロンプト）、そして参照したいスタイルの画像のURL（スタイル参照）を入力の要素として使います。画像プロンプトは被写体や要素に、スタイル参照は色合いや影、質感などの全体的な雰囲気に影響を与えます。これらを組み合わせることで、望むイメージに近づけられます。
[Brett] [09:35:00]

#### **ChatGPT**を使った高度なプロンプト生成 [10:57:00]
かつてプロンプト作成はスキルでしたが、現在では**ChatGPT**が非常に優れているため、もはやスキルではありません。**ChatGPT**に「〇〇の画像を生成するための**Midjourney**プロンプトを書いて」と依頼するだけで、詳細で洗練されたプロンプトを生成してくれます。これにより、ユーザーは複雑な表現を考える必要がなくなり、創造的なアイデア出しに集中できます。**ChatGPT**にコレクションのアイデア出しも任せられます。
[Brett] [10:57:00]

#### 一貫性のあるデザイン生成プロセス [13:32:00]
生成したいイメージの基本的なアイデアを**ChatGPT**に入力し、プロンプトを作成してもらいます。次に、**Pinterest**などで見つけた気に入ったスタイルの画像をスタイル参照として準備します。これらのプロンプトとスタイル参照を**Midjourney**に入力して画像を生成します。このプロセスにより、短時間で多様ながらも一貫性のあるスタイルを持つ画像を生成できます。
[Brett] [13:32:00]

### 応用レベル: 複数のツール連携 [14:46:00]
生成した画像をさらに発展させるために、複数のツールを連携させます。

#### 動画生成（**Runway**, **Cling**）とアップスケーリング（**Magnific**） [14:46:00]
**Midjourney**などで生成した静止画を**Runway**にアップロードすることで、動きを加えることができます。また、PhotoshopのGenerative Fillや、**Magnific**などのアップスケーラーを使って画像のディテールを向上させることも可能です。これらのツールを組み合わせることで、より高度でリアルなコンテンツを作成できます。
[Brett] [14:46:00]

#### 連続的な動画や音声付き動画の作成 [17:16:00]
**Runway**や**Cling**といったツールは通常5〜10秒程度の動画を生成しますが、動画の最後のフレームを保存し、それを次の動画の開始画像として生成することで、連続したより長い動画を作成できます。また、**Cling**のようにAIによるサウンド生成機能を備えたツールもあります。これらの短いクリップをシンプルな動画編集ツールで繋ぎ合わせることで、連続性のある映像作品を容易に作ることができます。
[Brett] [17:16:00]

### **Runway**での動画生成デモ [18:34:00]
Brett氏は、**Midjourney**で生成した画像を使って**Runway**での動画生成を実演します。

#### 実践的な動画生成手順 [18:34:00]
画像を**Runway**にアップロードし、**ChatGPT**で生成した動画用のプロンプトを入力します。プロンプトは画像内のどの要素をどのように動かすかを指示します。**ChatGPT**はツールの特性（例: **Runway**）を理解して適切な形式のプロンプトを作成します。
[Brett] [18:34:00]

#### アスペクト比と出力品質（4Kアップスケール） [20:24:00]
動画のアスペクト比は目的に応じて選択します。X（旧Twitter）などで共有する場合は、黒枠が表示されないように正方形（Square）が好まれます。生成された動画はボタン一つで4Kにアップスケールすることも可能です。
[Brett] [20:24:00]

#### ツールの限界と調整の必要性 [21:03:00]
**Runway**や**Midjourney**などのツールは完璧ではなく、意図しない動きやアーティファクトが発生することもあります。特に複雑な指示や3D回転などは苦手な場合があります。そのため、結果を見て必要に応じてプロンプトを調整し、再生成する必要があります。
[Brett] [21:03:00]

### ビジネスチャンス: AIクリエイティブエージェンシー [21:55:00]
このポッドキャストはスタートアップのアイデアを扱うものであるため、AIデザインがもたらすビジネス機会について議論します。

#### ブランディングにおけるAIの活用 [22:52:00]
現在のAIデザインの最大の機会はブランディングにあるとBrett氏は考えます。Webデザインなど他の分野はまだ発展途上ですが、ブランディングにおいては既に強力なツールとなっています。
[Brett] [22:52:00]

#### **Midjourney**ムードボードによる一貫性維持 [23:30:00]
**Midjourney**のムードボード機能を使うと、複数の参照画像をまとめて一つのスタイルコードとして扱うことができます。このコードをプロンプトに含めることで、生成される全てのアセットに一貫性を持たせることが可能です。これにより、ロゴや基本デザインが確立された後に、ソーシャルメディア投稿や広告などの派生アセットを非常に速いペースで、かつブランドの統一感を保ったまま大量に作成できます。
[Brett] [23:30:00]

#### AIが苦手な領域とデザイナーの必要性 [24:18:00]
AIはまだロゴデザインやベクターアート、完璧なテキスト生成などが苦手です。これらの要素については引き続きデザイナーのスキルが必要となります。しかし、一度基本アセットが完成すれば、AIを使ってそこから派生する様々なクリエイティブを迅速に生成できることが、現在の大きなレバレッジポイントです。
[Brett] [24:18:00]

### 生成アセットの活用例 [25:12:00]
**Runway**で生成された動画は、高品質で様々な用途に活用できます。

#### 広告制作への応用 [26:16:00]
生成された動画は広告（特にSNS広告）に最適です。動画にテキストをオーバーレイする場合、AIツール内で完結させるのは難しい場合があるため、**Cap Cut**のようなユーザーフレンドリーな動画編集ツールを使うのが簡単です。
[Brett] [26:16:00]

#### 動画編集ツール（**Cap Cut**）を使ったテキスト追加 [26:31:00]
動画にテキストを追加するような簡単な編集は、専用の動画編集ツールで行うのが効率的です。AIツールはあくまで素材生成に集中し、その後の仕上げは適切なツールで行うという切り分けが重要です。
[Brett] [26:31:00]

## 結論 [28:04:00]
AIデザインツールは非クリエイターでも短時間で素晴らしい成果を生み出すことを可能にしました。**ChatGPT**をAIツールとの対話の補助として活用し、**Midjourney**, **Runway**など得意なツールを見つけて使い込むことが重要です。ツールの完璧さにこだわりすぎず、まずは実際に試してみることで、少ない労力で驚くべきものを作成できるAIの可能性を実感できます。AIコミュニティの「ゲートキーピング」を取り払い、誰でもAIデザインにアクセスできるようにすることがBrett氏の目標です。

[02:41 - 02:45]
sipping time, baby.

[02:48 - 02:52]
And when you say easy, you know, you're

[02:50 - 02:54]
you're a super talented designer, so I'm

[02:52 - 02:57]
someone who's I wouldn't call myself a

[02:54 - 02:59]
designer. Will someone like me be able

[02:57 - 03:02]
to create insane value out of these

[02:59 - 03:03]
tools? That's the goal, right? Um, and

[03:02 - 03:04]
we'll go through this. There's

[03:03 - 03:08]
definitely there's definitely levels to

[03:04 - 03:09]
this AI generation thing. Uh most of the

[03:08 - 03:12]
content that I put out there is not

[03:09 - 03:14]
geared directly towards designers. It's

[03:12 - 03:16]
geared towards, you know, anybody with a

[03:14 - 03:18]
with a midjourney subscription, chat

[03:16 - 03:21]
subscription. So, um really don't have

[03:18 - 03:23]
to have any prior design knowledge at

[03:21 - 03:26]
all. Um having good taste definitely

[03:23 - 03:28]
helps, but aside from that, there's no

[03:26 - 03:30]
there's really no skill issue here at

[03:28 - 03:33]
all if you're a non-creative. All right,

[03:30 - 03:35]
let's get into it. Yeah, I mean, so

[03:33 - 03:39]
there's a lot of different realms with

[03:35 - 03:42]
this AI generative AI sort of uh phase

[03:39 - 03:44]
that we're in right now. Um, you know,

[03:42 - 03:45]
you have image generation, you have

[03:44 - 03:47]
video generation, you have all kinds of

[03:45 - 03:48]
different things. Um, so we'll start

[03:47 - 03:50]
with the top. We'll start with like the

[03:48 - 03:53]
easiest form if you want to kind of get

[03:50 - 03:55]
your feet wet with this AI creation um

[03:53 - 03:56]
thing that we're in right now. Not

[03:55 - 03:58]
sponsored by any of these tools. These

[03:56 - 03:59]
are just tools that I that I use in

[03:58 - 04:01]
different different sort of

[03:59 - 04:02]
circumstances. Um, so we'll start with

[04:01 - 04:04]
like the easiest, then we'll go into

[04:02 - 04:06]
like the realm that I play the most in.

[04:04 - 04:08]
Um, so like if you just wanted to, for

[04:06 - 04:11]
example, if we're in here, essentially

[04:08 - 04:12]
like Higsfield is is one of those again

[04:11 - 04:15]
you have no experience at all. You want

[04:12 - 04:19]
to just see how how this works. Um, so

[04:15 - 04:22]
Higsfield is um basically all these

[04:19 - 04:24]
templates that you can use, right? So we

[04:22 - 04:25]
can try one out if you want to. Can we

[04:24 - 04:29]
do that real quick? It's it's a pretty

[04:25 - 04:31]
quick thing. So, um, one of the hardest

[04:29 - 04:33]
parts about AI is understanding how to

[04:31 - 04:34]
talk to the AI and what to tell it to

[04:33 - 04:36]
actually do. I mean, if we're doing an

[04:34 - 04:38]
ad, for example, when it comes to video,

[04:36 - 04:41]
most of us don't talk like a director.

[04:38 - 04:44]
We don't know what dolly in, dolly out,

[04:41 - 04:46]
all that typically means. So, Higfield

[04:44 - 04:48]
is like is coming down to our level and

[04:46 - 04:51]
giving us these sort of preset

[04:48 - 04:53]
uh, actions so so to speak and effects.

[04:51 - 04:55]
And so we can just take let's just take

[04:53 - 04:58]
this for example here and I'll show you

[04:55 - 04:59]
how well this works. So uh let's go

[04:58 - 05:02]
let's see hopefully this follows me. So

[04:59 - 05:04]
let's do like a liquid death can. Do you

[05:02 - 05:05]
drink liquid death?

[05:04 - 05:09]
I

[05:05 - 05:11]
I tried it. I like my water out of Yeah.

[05:09 - 05:15]
Yeah. Yeah. out of a glass bottle. You

[05:11 - 05:17]
know I hear you. Um that's fair. I've

[05:15 - 05:19]
never tried it. So I'm not neither a fan

[05:17 - 05:21]
nor a nor a foe. So So we'll just add

[05:19 - 05:22]
this in. So, let's say you have a drink

[05:21 - 05:24]
company or if you have anything, you

[05:22 - 05:26]
know, any really anything. We'll see how

[05:24 - 05:28]
actually well this works. So, literally

[05:26 - 05:30]
all I did was I picked a preset, right?

[05:28 - 05:32]
Uploaded a picture of a of a product and

[05:30 - 05:35]
let's just hit generate and see what

[05:32 - 05:37]
happens. So, hopefully what it should

[05:35 - 05:38]
do, well, actually, we've done this

[05:37 - 05:42]
before, so we can we don't have to wait

[05:38 - 05:44]
for this. So, what it should do, um, I

[05:42 - 05:46]
think there's one down here that was

[05:44 - 05:49]
interesting. Yeah. So, it actually takes

[05:46 - 05:51]
into consideration the the can and the

[05:49 - 05:53]
branding. It could swap the model out

[05:51 - 05:56]
and then when you play this, you know,

[05:53 - 05:59]
it's like, oh my god, it's perfect. You

[05:56 - 06:00]
know, it maintains the text on the can.

[05:59 - 06:02]
That's one of these things like the text

[06:00 - 06:04]
has always been kind of the the problem

[06:02 - 06:06]
child of AI generation because it never

[06:04 - 06:09]
quite got it right. Well, we're we're

[06:06 - 06:11]
past that point now. It gets text right.

[06:09 - 06:13]
I wasn't into liquid death before, but

[06:11 - 06:15]
after watching that

[06:13 - 06:17]
video, I'm into liquid death. There you

[06:15 - 06:19]
go. There you go. Yeah. I mean it is

[06:17 - 06:21]
quick, right? I mean the the hardest

[06:19 - 06:23]
part about AI generation just waiting

[06:21 - 06:25]
for the image to generate. Um but with

[06:23 - 06:26]
this tool, right, you don't have to

[06:25 - 06:28]
prompt it. It has all these presets,

[06:26 - 06:30]
right? So this is and you have if you

[06:28 - 06:31]
click over here, right, this is where

[06:30 - 06:33]
you could prompt it if you wanted to do

[06:31 - 06:35]
something very specific. Upload your

[06:33 - 06:36]
reference photo. And then if you click

[06:35 - 06:38]
into here, you have again all of these

[06:36 - 06:40]
different effects, right? if I wanted to

[06:38 - 06:43]
turn something into metal, if I wanted

[06:40 - 06:45]
to just sort of call out different basic

[06:43 - 06:47]
camera controls on on certain things and

[06:45 - 06:50]
then it it just it just does it really

[06:47 - 06:52]
quick. No, no, you this is like again

[06:50 - 06:55]
like a good early entry into AI

[06:52 - 06:58]
generation. Um, now do I do a lot of

[06:55 - 07:00]
this? Not really. This is like it's fun

[06:58 - 07:02]
to show and again if you have a product,

[07:00 - 07:04]
it's a great way to create some cool

[07:02 - 07:08]
cool like ads for Instagram and stuff

[07:04 - 07:11]
like that. Um, but the real fun is is

[07:08 - 07:16]
over in the the Chad GBT midjourney side

[07:11 - 07:17]
of things. So, Chad GBT again, all of

[07:16 - 07:19]
these, we'll go to midjourney for a

[07:17 - 07:22]
moment. Midjourney is where we generate

[07:19 - 07:23]
these images, right? Uh, it's not video.

[07:22 - 07:24]
We're going to generate if you're going

[07:23 - 07:26]
to do video, this is where you oftent

[07:24 - 07:28]
times start because you need a you need

[07:26 - 07:31]
a base initial kind of reference image

[07:28 - 07:32]
to begin with. And so, what what's your

[07:31 - 07:36]
Greg? Have you used Midjourney quite a

[07:32 - 07:37]
bit or Yeah, I would say I've used it a

[07:36 - 07:40]
decent amount. A decent amount. Yeah.

[07:37 - 07:41]
So, the issue right now is you have all

[07:40 - 07:42]
these tools and they pop up all the

[07:41 - 07:44]
time, right? We have we have Cling, we

[07:42 - 07:47]
have Korea, we have all these different

[07:44 - 07:49]
we have Visual Electric, um

[07:47 - 07:52]
Flora, there's a there's a hundred of

[07:49 - 07:54]
them out there. Uh I I it's easy to get

[07:52 - 07:56]
distracted and figure out, you know,

[07:54 - 07:57]
should I be trying all these tools? I

[07:56 - 08:00]
pretty much stick to like the top three

[07:57 - 08:01]
or four of them. I keep a pulse on all

[08:00 - 08:04]
the other ones, but really like

[08:01 - 08:07]
Midjourney, MidJourney and Chap GBT are

[08:04 - 08:09]
the two that I use by far the most. And

[08:07 - 08:13]
I use them together in a really like

[08:09 - 08:16]
special way. Um, so MidJourney is like

[08:13 - 08:18]
phenomenal at styling, you know, if you

[08:16 - 08:21]
want to like this morning, for example.

[08:18 - 08:23]
Um, I'm doing branding for a work called

[08:21 - 08:25]
Leisure Labs, you know, and so I'm

[08:23 - 08:28]
generating these these sort of like

[08:25 - 08:30]
Kodak vintage aerial photos of of a golf

[08:28 - 08:32]
course, for example. Then I wanted to

[08:30 - 08:36]
supply a different a different sort of

[08:32 - 08:37]
brand direction for for like a surfer or

[08:36 - 08:40]
something like that, right? Kind of on

[08:37 - 08:42]
that leisure leisure side of things.

[08:40 - 08:44]
um did some other stuff around around

[08:42 - 08:46]
creating some some buildings and stuff,

[08:44 - 08:49]
but it gets the styling as far as like

[08:46 - 08:52]
the artistic styling is hard to none

[08:49 - 08:53]
than than any other tool out there. So,

[08:52 - 08:56]
this is where I go if I want to create

[08:53 - 09:00]
something really artistic. Uh chatbt on

[08:56 - 09:02]
the other hand is where I go if I want

[09:00 - 09:05]
something very specific. So, I'll take a

[09:02 - 09:07]
photo here, for example, and Mid Journey

[09:05 - 09:09]
can sometimes get the image right if I

[09:07 - 09:11]
want to add in a person to this photo

[09:09 - 09:13]
that's like teeing off or something. Uh,

[09:11 - 09:15]
but you could you could tell if I were

[09:13 - 09:17]
to zoom in on this, it it kind of it I

[09:15 - 09:21]
mean, kind of look at that shadow,

[09:17 - 09:23]
right? It's kind of weird. Um, and in an

[09:21 - 09:25]
ideal world, you take this into into

[09:23 - 09:27]
chatbt and say, "Hey, take this photo.

[09:25 - 09:28]
Just insert an overhead shot of a

[09:27 - 09:31]
golfer." and it would it would get it

[09:28 - 09:32]
mostly realistic, way more realistic

[09:31 - 09:34]
than mid Journey. So using them, knowing

[09:32 - 09:37]
how to use them together is is

[09:34 - 09:39]
definitely key. But these systems are

[09:37 - 09:41]
only as good as what prompt you give

[09:39 - 09:44]
them or what reference image you

[09:41 - 09:46]
provide. So for those that haven't used

[09:44 - 09:47]
MidJourney before, it's a very simple

[09:46 - 09:49]
system. We don't need to spend 30

[09:47 - 09:51]
minutes going undergoing how it works,

[09:49 - 09:53]
but you essentially have a prompt that

[09:51 - 09:54]
you can tell it what you want to do. And

[09:53 - 09:57]
then you're basically going to be using

[09:54 - 09:58]
image prompts and style references. So

[09:57 - 10:00]
image prompts for those don't that don't

[09:58 - 10:02]
know is if I insert a photo into here of

[10:00 - 10:04]
this surfer, it's going to the next

[10:02 - 10:05]
image it's going to generate might have

[10:04 - 10:06]
a person in it, might have a surfboard

[10:05 - 10:09]
in it, might have, you know, sort of

[10:06 - 10:11]
like greenery in it. Um, if I insert a

[10:09 - 10:13]
style reference, for example, this one

[10:11 - 10:14]
right here, it's whatever image I

[10:13 - 10:17]
generate, it's going to have those

[10:14 - 10:19]
colors, the same shadows, highlights,

[10:17 - 10:21]
depth of field, um, that sort of thing.

[10:19 - 10:24]
So you use those together in really cool

[10:21 - 10:26]
ways. And it's fun to like mix styles.

[10:24 - 10:29]
So, if I wanted to upload like this

[10:26 - 10:30]
orange style with this green style, you

[10:29 - 10:33]
can get some really cool generations

[10:30 - 10:34]
that are quite a bit quite surprising.

[10:33 - 10:36]
But again, they're only as good as the

[10:34 - 10:40]
prompt that you provide. And so, that's

[10:36 - 10:42]
where chat GBT comes in. So, it used to

[10:40 - 10:45]
be that that prompting was a skill and

[10:42 - 10:47]
it and it was before GPT got as good as

[10:45 - 10:49]
it was. knowing how to describe these

[10:47 - 10:52]
things that you wanted was like it

[10:49 - 10:53]
almost took you know like author level

[10:52 - 10:55]
skills when it come when it came to

[10:53 - 10:58]
writing and describing and kind of

[10:55 - 11:02]
visualizing and imagining these things

[10:58 - 11:04]
but nowadays um prompting is not a skill

[11:02 - 11:06]
it's it like people in the AI community

[11:04 - 11:08]
like to gatekeep it you know they'll say

[11:06 - 11:09]
here's the prompt that I wrote and

[11:08 - 11:11]
people like how do you think of those

[11:09 - 11:14]
things or or a lot of times they don't

[11:11 - 11:17]
even share the prompt but chatbt is very

[11:14 - 11:18]
good at giving doing prompts. So, we can

[11:17 - 11:22]
see an example here. So, if I'm going to

[11:18 - 11:25]
pull up like for example, I was doing I

[11:22 - 11:29]
wanted to do some like cowboy

[11:25 - 11:30]
uh cowboy art, right? So, I started with

[11:29 - 11:32]
a simple thing. I want I want to write

[11:30 - 11:34]
some image prompts to generate a zoomed

[11:32 - 11:35]
in photo of a cowboy in the back of a

[11:34 - 11:37]
horse riding the rains or holding

[11:35 - 11:38]
holding the rains. The photo should be

[11:37 - 11:40]
zoomed in on the hands and rains.

[11:38 - 11:43]
basically gives me, you know, a few

[11:40 - 11:45]
options for a prompt. And it does it in

[11:43 - 11:46]
a in a really well done way where I

[11:45 - 11:50]
could never write this stuff, right? I

[11:46 - 11:52]
could never think of it. Um, and if we

[11:50 - 11:54]
go over here to chatbt, we can actually

[11:52 - 11:56]
see what what these things created. Uh,

[11:54 - 11:59]
so let me scroll down here for a moment.

[11:56 - 12:01]
So I used a I used a style image, a

[11:59 - 12:03]
style reference of this image right

[12:01 - 12:05]
here. This was something that I created

[12:03 - 12:08]
in MidJourney. Uploaded it as a style

[12:05 - 12:10]
reference. didn't didn't upload an image

[12:08 - 12:12]
prop because I quite frankly I have a

[12:10 - 12:14]
prompt I don't really need that all that

[12:12 - 12:16]
much. So I put it in here and got

[12:14 - 12:19]
several several like really solid

[12:16 - 12:20]
options. Um and this is this is sort of

[12:19 - 12:23]
in the the realm of perplexity branding

[12:20 - 12:25]
for those that are fans fans of it. Huge

[12:23 - 12:27]
fan of it myself. And then you know I

[12:25 - 12:29]
basically just talked back to it. I said

[12:27 - 12:30]
now I want one zoomed in on a cowboy.

[12:29 - 12:32]
And it gave me some and I was like ah

[12:30 - 12:35]
that's not what I wanted. I meant I want

[12:32 - 12:37]
it I want it zoomed in on the the

[12:35 - 12:40]
cowboy's hat. Right. So, boom. Got this

[12:37 - 12:42]
like amazing image. And it's it's right

[12:40 - 12:44]
in line with this. And I kept that

[12:42 - 12:46]
going. You know, I was like, uh, now I

[12:44 - 12:49]
want one zoomed in on the c on the on

[12:46 - 12:52]
the horse's face. Boom. Done. Uh, and

[12:49 - 12:53]
then, you know, one that was zoomed out

[12:52 - 12:55]
showing some mountains in the

[12:53 - 12:56]
environment. And all I'm saying is

[12:55 - 12:59]
mountains in the same environment. And

[12:56 - 13:01]
it's like adding in all of this extra

[12:59 - 13:04]
like rich detail that really makes the

[13:01 - 13:05]
image what it is. So I'm just over here.

[13:04 - 13:08]
And then you could say like you could

[13:05 - 13:10]
even tell JTBT say, "Hey, I want to

[13:08 - 13:12]
create a collection of these as posters.

[13:10 - 13:14]
Give me some different scenes that tie

[13:12 - 13:16]
back to the to the same, you know,

[13:14 - 13:18]
initial prompt, but have different

[13:16 - 13:20]
elements in different environments." And

[13:18 - 13:21]
it'll just dream up all these

[13:20 - 13:23]
collections. You don't have to say like

[13:21 - 13:25]
a zoomed-in photo of the horse, a zoomed

[13:23 - 13:28]
in photo of this, or whatever. you can

[13:25 - 13:29]
let it kind of dream and imagine for you

[13:28 - 13:32]
which is really cool. So this is the

[13:29 - 13:34]
starting point for really good generated

[13:32 - 13:36]
uh you know AI art is actually

[13:34 - 13:38]
constructing a good prompt and then you

[13:36 - 13:40]
take that into here you know you plug in

[13:38 - 13:42]
a style image and boom you're you know

[13:40 - 13:44]
you're done at this point if you want to

[13:42 - 13:46]
do that and you can see I've done this

[13:44 - 13:49]
you know been doing this with different

[13:46 - 13:51]
worlds and and this is my latest sort of

[13:49 - 13:54]
tutorial is on these sort of like you

[13:51 - 13:56]
know isometric 3D you know worlds that

[13:54 - 13:59]
we bring into runway and add motion to

[13:56 - 14:01]
them which we can go through But it's

[13:59 - 14:04]
really not that complex. You have to

[14:01 - 14:07]
basically have a very basic idea of what

[14:04 - 14:09]
you want. Prompt that in chat GPT. Say,

[14:07 - 14:11]
"Hey, make me a prompt around this idea

[14:09 - 14:13]
or make me several and take those and

[14:11 - 14:14]
just start plugging in the midjourney.

[14:13 - 14:16]
Find a style that you want." Like

[14:14 - 14:19]
Pinterest is phenomenal for this. It's

[14:16 - 14:20]
all I use to generate, you know,

[14:19 - 14:22]
stylistic directions. I'll come on that.

[14:20 - 14:23]
It may not have anything related to what

[14:22 - 14:25]
I want to do, but it may be like the

[14:23 - 14:26]
right style, the right like 3D art, or

[14:25 - 14:28]
there might the right kind of like

[14:26 - 14:30]
feeling and vibe. And I upload as a

[14:28 - 14:32]
style im style reference, plug in my

[14:30 - 14:33]
prompt, and you just kind of just like

[14:32 - 14:35]
at that point, it's just fun to sit back

[14:33 - 14:39]
and see what what's created, you know.

[14:35 - 14:41]
Um, but yeah, that's that's sort of like

[14:39 - 14:43]
that's the the second tier of of AI

[14:41 - 14:45]
generation is using CHP and Midourney

[14:43 - 14:46]
together in that way. And then of

[14:45 - 14:48]
course, you can take these and throw

[14:46 - 14:49]
them into runway and add motion to them.

[14:48 - 14:52]
You can bring them into Photoshop and do

[14:49 - 14:53]
generative to fill. You can you can do

[14:52 - 14:55]
all kinds of things. You can throw them

[14:53 - 14:57]
into

[14:55 - 15:00]
magnific upscaler to really get all

[14:57 - 15:02]
these like super rich details. Um which

[15:00 - 15:04]
I've done in several of my tutorials. So

[15:02 - 15:05]
you then you start kind of leveling all

[15:04 - 15:08]
these tools on and that's where you get

[15:05 - 15:10]
this really dope stuff that is, you

[15:08 - 15:11]
know, hard to replicate unless you know

[15:10 - 15:15]
how to how to use them in tandem with

[15:11 - 15:17]
each other. Um, I mean even even this,

[15:15 - 15:19]
so the stuff that I'm seeing on the

[15:17 - 15:22]
screen and I've seen some of this on

[15:19 - 15:25]
your ex, you know, I think a lot of

[15:22 - 15:30]
people saw these beautiful images and

[15:25 - 15:33]
were like bookmark and like, but I can

[15:30 - 15:36]
never do that because Brett is a

[15:33 - 15:38]
designer. He's like been studying this

[15:36 - 15:39]
for years. He's a practitioner. He's he

[15:38 - 15:42]
made millions of dollars, you know,

[15:39 - 15:46]
doing design work. Therefore, yeah, I'll

[15:42 - 15:48]
see you later tutorial, aka bookmark.

[15:46 - 15:50]
But deep down, I think a lot of people

[15:48 - 15:52]
are like, I can never do it. I'd be

[15:50 - 15:54]
happy to show you. We can do one in like

[15:52 - 15:57]
we can do one of these scenes, for

[15:54 - 16:00]
example, from scratch in in, you know, 5

[15:57 - 16:02]
to 6 minutes. It's not hard, right? Like

[16:00 - 16:03]
going through the process of like you

[16:02 - 16:05]
can see this for example, right? This

[16:03 - 16:07]
beautiful image here. All I did was I

[16:05 - 16:10]
went on Pinterest. I found a picture of

[16:07 - 16:13]
a cabin, right? which was Let's see if

[16:10 - 16:14]
this loads up. Um, of course it's not

[16:13 - 16:19]
going to

[16:14 - 16:21]
load. Ah. Um, right here.

[16:19 - 16:23]
Boom. Yeah. Found a picture of a cabin.

[16:21 - 16:25]
This was not AI generated. This was just

[16:23 - 16:27]
simply pulled from a Pinterest uh a

[16:25 - 16:29]
Pinterest search. Had a reference image

[16:27 - 16:32]
here, which was this one here, a style

[16:29 - 16:34]
image that I have saved. I keep these

[16:32 - 16:35]
like in folders in my in my computer, so

[16:34 - 16:38]
I have all these different styles that I

[16:35 - 16:40]
can just reference back and forth. And

[16:38 - 16:41]
so yeah, it's going to create this cabin

[16:40 - 16:44]
with the style of these mountains. And

[16:41 - 16:45]
then you can see where you know pulling

[16:44 - 16:47]
in this color here. But then this this

[16:45 - 16:50]
sort of object is is get gets placed

[16:47 - 16:52]
here with this simple very simple

[16:50 - 16:54]
prompt. And then you go over to runway,

[16:52 - 16:57]
you upload this picture, you give it a

[16:54 - 16:58]
prompt which you create with chatbt. You

[16:57 - 17:01]
go to chatbt say hey here's the image

[16:58 - 17:03]
that I want to turn into a video. Give

[17:01 - 17:05]
me a prompt that would tell runway what

[17:03 - 17:07]
what like what exactly to move. And

[17:05 - 17:09]
it'll come back and it'll give you,

[17:07 - 17:10]
yeah, put soft ripples in the water,

[17:09 - 17:12]
have the smoke coming, have the trees

[17:10 - 17:14]
blowing softly in the wind, but like

[17:12 - 17:16]
tell it to you very eloquently and like

[17:14 - 17:18]
sophisticated. And then you just press

[17:16 - 17:19]
generate and you sit back, wait for it

[17:18 - 17:22]
to generate, and boom, like 5 minutes

[17:19 - 17:24]
later, you have a beautiful a beautiful

[17:22 - 17:26]
video. Then you can even take that

[17:24 - 17:30]
further. You can go over to cling. You

[17:26 - 17:33]
know, Cling is another image to video

[17:30 - 17:36]
tool um that allows start and end frame,

[17:33 - 17:37]
which means that you can loop it. So,

[17:36 - 17:39]
the video will start and end with the

[17:37 - 17:41]
same frame and and Cling will just fill

[17:39 - 17:43]
in the the in between. So, that if you

[17:41 - 17:44]
had like a an icon that you wanted to

[17:43 - 17:45]
put on your site and you wanted to kind

[17:44 - 17:48]
of endlessly loop or it wasn't this

[17:45 - 17:49]
harsh reset, you just set the start

[17:48 - 17:51]
frame and end frame to the same image

[17:49 - 17:53]
and it just infinitely loops. And then

[17:51 - 17:54]
once that's generated, then it has a

[17:53 - 17:57]
little button that says AI sound and

[17:54 - 17:58]
it'll take into context the video and

[17:57 - 18:00]
give you sound options that are AI

[17:58 - 18:02]
generated. So you can I mean you can go

[18:00 - 18:04]
and then if you wanted to right these

[18:02 - 18:06]
these these prompt tools are limited to

[18:04 - 18:09]
about 10 seconds per video. You can go

[18:06 - 18:11]
to the end video, right click on your

[18:09 - 18:14]
your computer, save the last frame as an

[18:11 - 18:16]
image, upload that as the next video. So

[18:14 - 18:18]
the the next video will start at the

[18:16 - 18:20]
last frame of your last video and have a

[18:18 - 18:21]
continuous shot for as long as you want

[18:20 - 18:23]
and then stitch them together with a

[18:21 - 18:24]
with a simple video editing tool that

[18:23 - 18:26]
you don't have to have really any

[18:24 - 18:29]
experience doing. You're just dragging

[18:26 - 18:31]
clips onto a timeline and exporting. So

[18:29 - 18:32]
it's not it's not really that it's not

[18:31 - 18:35]
really that complicated when you when

[18:32 - 18:38]
you look at it this way. Could we look

[18:35 - 18:41]
at some of the the more complex runways

[18:38 - 18:44]
or you know Yeah. Do you want to Should

[18:41 - 18:48]
we like just for the sake of this just

[18:44 - 18:51]
do one of these? Yeah. So, let's do um

[18:48 - 18:54]
let's pick an image here. Which one do

[18:51 - 18:56]
we like? Like I like this one. Oh, yeah.

[18:54 - 18:58]
This one's cool. So, what I would do I

[18:56 - 18:59]
could probably describe the movement

[18:58 - 19:02]
because I've done this a 100 times

[18:59 - 19:04]
creating a creating a tutorial, right?

[19:02 - 19:06]
Um, but we're just going to throw this

[19:04 - 19:08]
in here and we're going to tell it we

[19:06 - 19:10]
don't have to be we don't have to be

[19:08 - 19:13]
sophisticated in the way we we talk to

[19:10 - 19:16]
CHPT. It it can understand very little

[19:13 - 19:22]
and expand upon it. So, I'm going to use

[19:16 - 19:25]
runway to add motion to this image. Give

[19:22 - 19:28]
me a

[19:25 - 19:29]
prompt. Okay. So, it's going to

[19:28 - 19:31]
understand it's not even just going to

[19:29 - 19:32]
understand it. Well, it's going to

[19:31 - 19:33]
understand what you want to do, but it's

[19:32 - 19:35]
even going to understand the tool that

[19:33 - 19:36]
you're going to use so that it writes it

[19:35 - 19:38]
a certain way. Because if I were to say

[19:36 - 19:40]
like I want to use this up at put up at

[19:38 - 19:42]
midjourney for something, it's going to

[19:40 - 19:44]
give you like the style parameters and

[19:42 - 19:46]
all these sorts of tags at the end. But

[19:44 - 19:47]
since it's runway, we just need very

[19:46 - 19:48]
kind of a text format. So, we'll head

[19:47 - 19:50]
over to

[19:48 - 19:53]
runway. And this is just one of many

[19:50 - 19:56]
many of these tools. Cling, Korea, all

[19:53 - 19:58]
of them do it. Uh Runway is is certainly

[19:56 - 20:00]
on the upper echelon of like quality.

[19:58 - 20:04]
Um, so we'll just upload a we'll upload

[20:00 - 20:05]
an asset here that we have already

[20:04 - 20:09]
generated

[20:05 - 20:11]
before. Let that upload and then so

[20:09 - 20:12]
that's our image. We're going to just

[20:11 - 20:13]
paste the prompt in here. Let me read

[20:12 - 20:16]
read through this real quick. Just make

[20:13 - 20:18]
sure that software is okay. Keep the

[20:16 - 20:19]
keep the camera completely still for a

[20:18 - 20:21]
piece. See it even get it even

[20:19 - 20:23]
understands that. So there's not this

[20:21 - 20:24]
all this movement around. And of course

[20:23 - 20:26]
you could tweak all this, right? Then

[20:24 - 20:28]
we're going to have the aspect ratio

[20:26 - 20:30]
just be square. Uh, we'll do 10 seconds.

[20:28 - 20:32]
Like I said, it's generally five to 10

[20:30 - 20:34]
seconds. We'll let that we'll let that

[20:32 - 20:36]
run. Why did you choose square versus

[20:34 - 20:39]
another format? Well, so I'm sh I'm

[20:36 - 20:42]
typically sharing these on X. Uh, I like

[20:39 - 20:44]
portrait media for for the most, but

[20:42 - 20:46]
when you're sharing a video on X, it'll

[20:44 - 20:47]
add black borders to the side of it. I

[20:46 - 20:49]
don't like that. I hate it. It kind of

[20:47 - 20:51]
ruins the aesthetic for me. So square is

[20:49 - 20:52]
the square is the best. Now, if you

[20:51 - 20:53]
wanted to share something super

[20:52 - 20:57]
cinematic,

[20:53 - 20:58]
uh, you do like 16 by9. But u I like

[20:57 - 20:59]
square because you it's it's bigger on

[20:58 - 21:03]
your screen. It catch it's going to

[20:59 - 21:05]
catch your eye far more. Um and one

[21:03 - 21:06]
other thing I'll say about all this and

[21:05 - 21:09]
this goes for

[21:06 - 21:12]
chatbt not chatbt as much. It usually

[21:09 - 21:14]
nails things um midjourney and runway

[21:12 - 21:16]
and all these tools. They're far from

[21:14 - 21:19]
perfect. You know, I've done, for

[21:16 - 21:22]
example, I was trying to do a 3D logo uh

[21:19 - 21:24]
rotate like on a on an axis and it like

[21:22 - 21:26]
got halfway and then just some cartoon

[21:24 - 21:27]
character popped out of it and I'm like,

[21:26 - 21:29]
"What the heck? Where did that come

[21:27 - 21:31]
from?" So, they're they could be a

[21:29 - 21:33]
little finicky. So, you have to you have

[21:31 - 21:35]
to kind of understand what it's going to

[21:33 - 21:37]
be good at and what it's what it might

[21:35 - 21:39]
do some weird things and and just adjust

[21:37 - 21:41]
your prompts accordingly. So, we'll do

[21:39 - 21:43]
this. It might nail it, but it might

[21:41 - 21:44]
also have like a weird zoom in on it.

[21:43 - 21:47]
And so we'll have to readjust things. We

[21:44 - 21:48]
won't do this for the video, but you

[21:47 - 21:49]
there might be some weird artifacts or

[21:48 - 21:52]
something like that that you that you

[21:49 - 21:54]
notice and you just have to kind of redo

[21:52 - 21:56]
it, reprompt it if you need to and kind

[21:54 - 21:58]
of keep trying. But and while this is

[21:56 - 22:00]
uploading, I'm curious your perspective

[21:58 - 22:03]
on this. So this podcast is called the

[22:00 - 22:05]
Startup Ideas Podcast. It's generally

[22:03 - 22:08]
people who want to build startup ideas

[22:05 - 22:11]
and and quit their job or do a side

[22:08 - 22:15]
hustle or something like that. What does

[22:11 - 22:20]
this whole world of, you know, AI

[22:15 - 22:24]
designing or vibe designing enable

[22:20 - 22:25]
for, you know, for these people and what

[22:24 - 22:29]
are some opportunities that you can

[22:25 - 22:32]
think of that, um, you think will will

[22:29 - 22:34]
be very lucrative? Yeah, I mean there's

[22:32 - 22:36]
there's what's capable today which is

[22:34 - 22:38]
again like a lot of what's being shared

[22:36 - 22:41]
out there is is really more on just like

[22:38 - 22:43]
the fun creative side kind of just you

[22:41 - 22:45]
know testing these tools out generating

[22:43 - 22:47]
things that aren't quite used every day

[22:45 - 22:49]
in the actual design world more more

[22:47 - 22:52]
than just like a Twitter post you know

[22:49 - 22:54]
sharing a tutorial but uh I think the

[22:52 - 22:56]
biggest opportunity right now for

[22:54 - 22:58]
creatives is is really on the branding

[22:56 - 23:01]
side you know there the the web design

[22:58 - 23:03]
side hasn't really had its day in AI

[23:01 - 23:05]
quite yet. It's on its way with tools

[23:03 - 23:09]
like Bolt and Lovable and all these, but

[23:05 - 23:13]
the output's pretty mediocre, right?

[23:09 - 23:16]
Um, branding is, you know, is amazing.

[23:13 - 23:17]
So, if I if for example what I can do

[23:16 - 23:19]
for you, Greg, if if you wanted to hire

[23:17 - 23:20]
me to design like a leisure, you know,

[23:19 - 23:23]
leisure brand like I was describing,

[23:20 - 23:26]
right? I can go into midjourney over

[23:23 - 23:28]
here. I can as your designer or even

[23:26 - 23:30]
you, you know, once you once you find

[23:28 - 23:31]
one asset that you really like, you can

[23:30 - 23:33]
go into mid Journey, you can actually

[23:31 - 23:35]
set up a mood board. Have you ever done

[23:33 - 23:36]
this before or seen this before? No.

[23:35 - 23:38]
Yeah. So, you can set up a mood board,

[23:36 - 23:41]
right? And I set up a mood board for

[23:38 - 23:42]
these for these cowboy images. Now,

[23:41 - 23:46]
anything that I want to do at this point

[23:42 - 23:47]
in time, I can use this this code as a

[23:46 - 23:50]
prompt, and it's going to reference back

[23:47 - 23:52]
to all of this here. And so, it gives

[23:50 - 23:55]
you the ability to basically create

[23:52 - 23:56]
content that's that's that that's relate

[23:55 - 23:58]
that relates to one another. There's

[23:56 - 24:00]
continuity between the content and and

[23:58 - 24:03]
it's it's uh what's the what's the word

[24:00 - 24:05]
I'm looking for? Consistent, right? Um

[24:03 - 24:07]
so I could give either I could give this

[24:05 - 24:09]
to you and then you could basically if

[24:07 - 24:10]
you if you have, you know, this is a

[24:09 - 24:12]
background or whatever for social media

[24:10 - 24:13]
post or whatever it is, you have the

[24:12 - 24:16]
ability to then begin to kind of

[24:13 - 24:18]
replicate that at very fast paces and

[24:16 - 24:19]
it's all going to be kind of cohesive.

[24:18 - 24:21]
Um there's little things like it's not

[24:19 - 24:23]
good at logo design right now. you can't

[24:21 - 24:27]
really like generate the entire brand

[24:23 - 24:29]
using it. It's not text isn't perfect.

[24:27 - 24:31]
Ve, it doesn't do vector art, you know,

[24:29 - 24:33]
things like that. So, you still need a

[24:31 - 24:34]
designer for some of those pieces. But

[24:33 - 24:36]
once those pieces are set, the ability

[24:34 - 24:38]
for you to take those references and

[24:36 - 24:41]
continue to build new additional

[24:38 - 24:43]
creatives um off of it is really really

[24:41 - 24:46]
where the opportunity is today. I think

[24:43 - 24:48]
that'll get even crazier as times go on,

[24:46 - 24:50]
especially with the website side of

[24:48 - 24:51]
things and like that sort of thing. But

[24:50 - 24:53]
branding is really the biggest the

[24:51 - 24:55]
biggest leverage point at this point

[24:53 - 24:57]
when it comes to AI and the ability to

[24:55 - 25:00]
just generate consistent assets, you

[24:57 - 25:02]
know, at a very quick pace.

[25:00 - 25:04]
Um, yeah, that's that, you know,

[25:02 - 25:05]
obviously outside of that, Chad GP and

[25:04 - 25:06]
stuff can be used for all kinds of

[25:05 - 25:08]
things when it comes to startups, but

[25:06 - 25:09]
the actual design piece that that's

[25:08 - 25:12]
really where that's really where the

[25:09 - 25:13]
majority of the of the opportunity is at

[25:12 - 25:15]
this point in time. Let's go back to

[25:13 - 25:17]
this and see if it did it. So, we'll

[25:15 - 25:19]
play this and hope hopefully we cross

[25:17 - 25:22]
our fingers and it it just nails it. put

[25:19 - 25:24]
that in a museum. You know what I mean?

[25:22 - 25:25]
Right. And then what's crazier? Okay, we

[25:24 - 25:27]
can we can sit down here and we can say

[25:25 - 25:29]
upscale to 4K and we just click it and

[25:27 - 25:34]
it just does it. You know, now we have a

[25:29 - 25:36]
4K a 4K video. And then what's crazy is

[25:34 - 25:39]
you can you can take this I can right

[25:36 - 25:40]
click on this and save a video frame. I

[25:39 - 25:43]
can bring this back over here to here

[25:40 - 25:45]
and say, "Hey, runway, you know, uh or

[25:43 - 25:47]
or chatbt or or midjourney." Like

[25:45 - 25:49]
pretend as if you're a a real estate

[25:47 - 25:51]
photographer.

[25:49 - 25:54]
and I need different different angles of

[25:51 - 25:56]
this building shot for for a a listing

[25:54 - 25:58]
or a magazine or something like that and

[25:56 - 26:00]
it can get into that role and and take

[25:58 - 26:02]
this reference and and take different

[26:00 - 26:04]
shots of it. Then you could throw those

[26:02 - 26:06]
into runway, add the same motion we just

[26:04 - 26:08]
did, stitch them together in one video

[26:06 - 26:11]
and then you have this amazing, you

[26:08 - 26:14]
know, multi-frame, multi- scene scene

[26:11 - 26:16]
video very quickly. So, it's pretty it's

[26:14 - 26:19]
pretty uh it's pretty amazing. I would

[26:16 - 26:22]
imagine the use case for a lot of these

[26:19 - 26:25]
videos is going to be ads. Yes. Um, how

[26:22 - 26:28]
would you if I wanted to put text on top

[26:25 - 26:31]
of these videos? Is that possible? Yeah.

[26:28 - 26:33]
So, text on top. So, you it does require

[26:31 - 26:35]
it. There's certain things where you

[26:33 - 26:38]
want to branch off, right? Like you

[26:35 - 26:39]
could tell runway to do that. It may get

[26:38 - 26:42]
it, but if it doesn't, it's slightly

[26:39 - 26:43]
off. You can't just like use your mouse

[26:42 - 26:46]
pointer to like move it, right? It's

[26:43 - 26:48]
embedded in the video. So, this is where

[26:46 - 26:50]
I would I would say this video, use a

[26:48 - 26:52]
very userfriendly

[26:50 - 26:54]
um video platform like Cap Cut where

[26:52 - 26:56]
you're just going to drag this in and

[26:54 - 26:57]
then drag a text layer on top and you're

[26:56 - 26:59]
done. You can position however you want.

[26:57 - 27:01]
You don't have to have any video

[26:59 - 27:04]
experience at all to do that. Very

[27:01 - 27:05]
simple. Takes, you know, 5 seconds. So,

[27:04 - 27:06]
there that's where there are certain

[27:05 - 27:08]
points where you do want to use

[27:06 - 27:11]
traditional tools to get to get those

[27:08 - 27:13]
things quite right. Um, but again, like

[27:11 - 27:15]
Chad GBT does a good job of that, but

[27:13 - 27:17]
Chad does doesn't do video really. They

[27:15 - 27:18]
have Sora, but it's really poor output.

[27:17 - 27:20]
But yeah, just like I was doing stuff

[27:18 - 27:22]
this morning for an e-commerce shop, and

[27:20 - 27:23]
they have their products on set on these

[27:22 - 27:25]
like cool background images and stuff,

[27:23 - 27:27]
and so I was just generating all kinds

[27:25 - 27:30]
of psychedelic weird like background

[27:27 - 27:33]
images. Um, yeah, it's it's it's a

[27:30 - 27:34]
creative person's dream, but it's

[27:33 - 27:35]
definitely fun, even if you're a

[27:34 - 27:37]
non-creative, to be able to just

[27:35 - 27:39]
generate something as beautiful as this.

[27:37 - 27:41]
like you could never have done anything

[27:39 - 27:42]
remotely close to this. I'm a creative

[27:41 - 27:44]
and I could have never done anything

[27:42 - 27:46]
remotely close to this um for the rest

[27:44 - 27:49]
of my career most likely, but now I can

[27:46 - 27:52]
do it in 5 minutes. Um Brett, this has

[27:49 - 27:55]
been eyeopening. Um I'm getting my hands

[27:52 - 27:57]
dirty literally right after this. Um

[27:55 - 28:00]
thank you for coming on. I'm going to

[27:57 - 28:03]
include uh where to find Brett and

[28:00 - 28:05]
follow his tutorials in the show notes

[28:03 - 28:08]
so people can go and follow him there.

[28:05 - 28:11]
Brett, is there anything uh you want to

[28:08 - 28:13]
leave people with or say?

[28:11 - 28:15]
Yeah. No, I mean, like I said, get like

[28:13 - 28:17]
what you're going to do, get your hands

[28:15 - 28:20]
dirty. Utilize Chatb2 to help you talk

[28:17 - 28:21]
to these AI tools. Uh and and know which

[28:20 - 28:23]
ones are good at different things. But

[28:21 - 28:24]
yeah, mostly just get your hands dirty.

[28:23 - 28:26]
Don't don't stress about there being too

[28:24 - 28:27]
many tools. Like pick a couple that

[28:26 - 28:29]
you're that you like. Stick with them,

[28:27 - 28:31]
learn how they work. Um, yeah, you can

[28:29 - 28:32]
do you can do really remarkable things

[28:31 - 28:34]
with very little effort, which I think

[28:32 - 28:35]
is the is the coolest part about AI and

[28:34 - 28:36]
something not a lot of people want to

[28:35 - 28:39]
say or admit. You know, I think there's

[28:36 - 28:41]
a there's a a level of gatekeep keeping

[28:39 - 28:42]
this around this sort of stuff and and

[28:41 - 28:44]
my goal is just to kind of break down

[28:42 - 28:46]
those barriers and show pretty much

[28:44 - 28:48]
anybody can do this sort of stuff. So,

[28:46 - 28:51]
yeah, that's it. Well, I appreciate

[28:48 - 28:53]
that. Like, this is sauce as far as I'm

[28:51 - 28:56]
concerned. this is like good sauce that

[28:53 - 28:58]
you're sharing and and you demystify

[28:56 - 28:59]
this for thousands of people watching

[28:58 - 29:02]
and it's going to make a difference in

[28:59 - 29:04]
their lives 100%. So, thank you for

[29:02 - 29:07]
sharing your knowledge and being here

[29:04 - 29:09]
and being so generous. Of course, my

[29:07 - 29:12]
pleasure. Thanks for having me on, Brett

[29:09 - 29:14]
from Design Joy.

[29:12 - 29:14]
This.

He basically summed it up at the end: these types of images and videos are created almost entirely for fun—to share on social media. You can make money by typing in some prompts and generating  some images. You certainly won’t be making $,2800 a day. You’d be lucky to make that in a year as an “AI image generator person”. And nobody is going to hire you for branding work.

You know what’s actually criminal? That Black Algorithm How to Escape the Money Matrix isn’t viral. This book holds the kind of truth that makes institutions uncomfortable. And once you read it, you start noticing how deep the programming goes.

I am building an AI Conversational Voice Agency for Tradesmen.  Im an electrician and got laid off in November after years of dedication.  I want to have the financial freedom and never get laid off again as well as support my fellow Tradesmen with AI. Many are working out of their trucks and working hard. If a call comes in when they're working and they don't answer that call, they could miss their next job and possibly their next meal. My AI will capture those leads and thru AI Automations follow up with those contacts after booking the appointment scheduled in my white labeled CRM. Thank you for all your content and all you do for us regardless.

> **@Kyle-g2u7z** (👍 0): .I've got that .send them a message hi I'm working on a job but I'll call you asap ..if it's an emergency answer 1 and I'll stop and call within a few minutes
The key is selling it which I want to ..I'm in the same situation.as you

> **@MrMcWitt** (👍 0): Ahh good luck, so is a company my buddy works at. You might be able to get a couple clients, but the small guys will absolutely not be able to compete with the AI tooling and pricing the big guys are building . People like this guy are mainly just selling you the dream. Everyone in the space is building the same exact tools.

When I first saw Brett on a podcast last year, he really opened my eyes to the idea of a one person, $1m+ per year business. I would highly suggest everyone watch his episode on Starter Story where he breaks down how he runs Designjoy. Great episode as always Greg and I can't wait for your upcoming one with Nick Saraev.

More people need to read The Hidden Money Gate by Eric Danehart because it does what most books only pretend to do...give you real tools, not theories. It felt like unlocking a part of my brain I didn’t know was off

### 12. @Plant-m4t (👍 79)
This video is a perfect example of quality over quantity. It’s rare to find someone who actually gets to the core of what matters... If this hit home for anyone else like it did for me, I can’t recommend The Hidden Money Gate by Eric Danehart enough... It’s one of the few books I’ve read that lays out a realistic, no-nonsense approach to building wealth without the hype. Every chapter had me thinking differently
