Let me create a powerful slide 3 that showcases the strategic transformation and solution proposed in the meeting. This slide should focus on:

The "二次創業" (second founding) concept
The new "Light AI Feedback" product direction
Global expansion strategy
I'll maintain the visual style from the previous slides with the dark gradient background and red accent colors. I'll also ensure the content fits within the 720px height constraint.

Let me design this slide with a strong visual impact:

A clear headline about the strategic transformation
Visual representation of the new business model
Key points about the solution
A powerful quote from the meeting to convey determination
I'll use cards or visual elements to highlight the three main aspects of the strategy: second founding concept, Light AI Feedback, and global expansion.
