For the second slide, I need to create a visually powerful presentation of TANREN's current challenges based on the meeting minutes. The key issues mentioned were:

Initial user support limitations - beginners requiring intense support that drains resources
AGI-driven internal development risks - competitors or clients being able to replicate TANREN's core functionality
Competition with generic AI like ChatGPT - price comparison pressure
I want to create a slide that conveys urgency and a sense of crisis while maintaining a professional presentation style. I'll create a slide with:

A bold headline about the crisis
Three main challenge areas with clear iconography
Visual elements that emphasize the urgency
Key quotes or data points from the meeting
I'll maintain the design language from the first slide with the gradient background and accent colors, but focus on presenting these critical challenges.

Let me design the HTML for this slide:
