Let's create the final slide (slide 5) for the TANREN strategy presentation. This slide should focus on future action plans and emphasize the commitment to AI-driven growth.

From the instructions and the content of previous slides, I need to create a visually appealing and impactful slide that includes:

Action plans - specifically the weekly Cursor study sessions on Tuesday mornings at 9 AM
The ambitious goal of "3 people achieving 5-10 billion yen in revenue"
The concept of "independent learning methodology" (独学術)
A strong closing message with the characteristic energy/passion (熱量) of Sato-san
Design-wise, I'll maintain consistency with the previous slides which use:

A dark gradient background
Bright accent colors for emphasis
Modern typography with Noto Sans JP
Clean, structured layout with cards/sections
Font Awesome icons
For this final slide, I'll create a design that conveys determination and forward momentum, focusing on concrete next steps while reinforcing the ambitious vision.

Let me create the HTML for slide 5:
