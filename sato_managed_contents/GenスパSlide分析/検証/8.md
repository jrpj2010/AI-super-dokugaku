Alright, I'm tasked with creating an HTML slide that matches the theme and design of the existing presentation. This slide will be about "今すぐ実践！営業×AI融合の第一歩" (Implement Now! First Steps to Sales×AI Integration).

Looking at the previous slides, I notice:

They use a gradient background (going from oranges to yellows based on the last slide)
They use Tailwind CSS for styling
Font Awesome for icons
They have animated elements that appear with delays
They have a consistent layout with a title at the top and content divided into sections
For this slide (#8), I'll create a design that:

Continues the color gradient (from orange/yellow to yellow/green)
Maintains the same styling patterns
Focuses on the 3 steps mentioned in the content:
Step 1: "営業プロセスの可視化" (Visualizing Sales Processes)
Step 2: "Quick Win" から始める (Start with Quick Wins)
Step 3: "チーム展開" で組織力向上 (Team Deployment for Organizational Improvement)
Includes visual elements like checklists, step indicators, and animations
Let me create the HTML structure:
