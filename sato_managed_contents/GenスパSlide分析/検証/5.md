I'm going to create the 5th slide focusing on "営業部門必見！Claude 4を100%活用する「5つの極意」" (Must-see for Sales Departments! 5 Key Techniques to 100% Utilize Claude 4). This slide will explain 5 prompting techniques from Anthropic's official prompt engineering guide, adapted for sales activities.

Based on the previous slides, I'll maintain a consistent design style but change the gradient to purple tones as requested. I'll follow The Verge-style tech design with bold typography and sharp elements.

Let me outline the structure for the slide:

Title: "営業部門必見！Claude 4を100%活用する「5つの極意」"
Content: 5 key prompting techniques with:
Icons for each technique
Brief explanation
Good/bad example comparison
Visual elements:
Modern tech-style background with gradient
Consistent design elements (grid patterns, card styles)
Visual examples of prompting techniques
Key techniques to cover:

明示的な指示 (Explicit Instructions)
背景と動機 (Background and Motivation)
XMLタグ (XML Tags)
並列処理 (Parallel Processing)
思考機能 (Thought Process)
I'll create the HTML with the same styling pattern as previous slides, utilizing Tailwind CSS for layout and styling, Font Awesome for icons, and adding visual examples of each technique.
