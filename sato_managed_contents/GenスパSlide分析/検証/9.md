Let's create a visually appealing, high-impact summary slide that serves as the culmination of the presentation. Based on the content from the previous slides and the theme of the presentation, this slide should emphasize the key points about Claude 4 changing the future of sales.

The title should be "まとめ：営業の未来は、もう始まっている" (Summary: The Future of Sales Has Already Begun), as mentioned in the outline.

The slide should highlight three main points:

What Rakuten's 7-hour experiment proved - demonstrating Claude's sustained performance
Why GitHub and Cursor chose Claude 4 - showing its human-like quality and tireless execution
The 2026 divide - being on the right side of AI adoption
I'll use a green-to-yellow gradient background to maintain the flow from the previous slide's orange-to-yellow gradient.

The design should be consistent with The Verge-style tech aesthetics, using bold typography, sharp elements, and a gradient background.

Let me draft the HTML for this slide:
