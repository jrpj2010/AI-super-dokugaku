I need to create slide 6 for the presentation, which is about "実録：90分で数日分の仕事を終わらせた衝撃のデモ" (A record of a shocking demo that completed several days' worth of work in 90 minutes).

Based on the task brief, I should include:

A title about the 90-minute demo that completed several days of work
A timeline on the left showing Claude Code's 90-minute action log (with time intervals and actions)
A comparison on the right showing equivalent sales activities
A quote from Kat Wu (Product Manager) at the bottom
A design with a purple to red gradient, with visual effects showing the flow of time
Let me structure the HTML file for this slide:

Set up the HTML structure with appropriate meta tags and external resources
Create a gradient background from purple to red
Design a timeline visualization for the 90-minute process
Create a comparison table/visualization for sales activities
Add the quote section with proper styling
Include any necessary animations or visual elements to represent time flow
Looking at the previous slides, I'll maintain a consistent style while transitioning to the purple-red gradient theme. I'll use Tailwind CSS for styling and Font Awesome for icons.

Let's write the HTML code:
