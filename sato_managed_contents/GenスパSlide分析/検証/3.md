I need to create the 3rd slide focusing on "楽天が証明した「7時間の奇跡」―― Claude Opus 4の実力" (Rakuten's proof of the "7-hour miracle" - Claude Opus 4's capabilities).

Based on the content from the source article, this slide should highlight:

Claude Opus 4's key specifications:

SWE-bench score: 72.5% (world's highest)
Terminal-bench score: 43.2% (industry top)
Continuous operation time: 7+ hours
Parallel processing capability
Memory functionality (self-managed memory files)
Rakuten's case study:

7 hours of continuous autonomous work
No performance degradation
Zero human intervention to complete tasks
I should include a visual representation like a chart to show performance maintenance over time.

The design should follow The Verge style with blue and purple gradients, bold typography, and sharp elements. I'll maintain consistency with the previous slides.

Let me create the HTML structure:
