I'm going to create the final slide (slide 10) for this presentation about Claude 4 and its impact on sales activities. Based on the information provided, this should be a contact/closing slide with TANREN company information.

Here's what I need to include:

Title: "お問い合わせ先" (Contact Information)
TANREN company logo/graphic element (since I can't include actual images, I'll create a stylized text logo)
Company name: "TANREN株式会社"
Promotional text: "AI営業革命セミナー実施中！" (AI Sales Revolution Seminar in Progress!)
Contact info: Website URL "www.tanren.co.jp" and email "info@tanren.co.jp"
Presenter info: "プレゼンター：佐藤勝彦" and "TANREN株式会社 代表取締役"
Small Claude 4 logo/icon with "Powered by Claude 4" text
For the design, I'll use:

A gradient background transitioning from green to blue (to continue from slide 9's yellow-green-blue gradient)
Clean, modern tech-inspired elements consistent with The Verge style
Visual elements that suggest connectivity and future technology
Proper animations for a polished finish
Let's create this HTML code for the final slide:s
