I need to create an HTML slide for a presentation about "CEO対談で明かされた「2026年、1人で10億ドル企業」の真実" (The truth about "2026, a one-person billion-dollar company" revealed in the CEO interview). This will be slide 7 in the presentation.

Based on the task brief, I'll create a slide that includes:

A title about the CEO interview and the 2026 prediction
Left side with Dario Amodei CEO's photo/illustration and quotes from his interview with Mike Krieger
Right side with bullet points showing the impact of his predictions on sales activities
Dario's advice "Be ambitious" highlighted at the bottom
Background gradient from red to orange with futuristic elements representing 2026
Let me follow the design style established in slides 5 and 6, which use:

Tailwind CSS for styling
Font Awesome for icons
The Verge-style tech design with gradients
Animation effects for visual interest
I'll start by creating the basic HTML structure and styling, then add the content sections:

HTML structure with proper libraries
Background gradient from red to orange
Title section
Two-column layout (CEO quotes and sales impact)
Highlighted advice section
Visual elements representing future/2026
Animation effects
I'll make sure to maintain the width of 1280px and keep content within the 720px height as requested.
